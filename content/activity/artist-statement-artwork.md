		<p><strong>Steven Rendall<br />Recent Developments I, 2018</strong></p>
		<p><span id="what">This is one of 3 works titled Recent Developments: In making these works I was trying to mesh personal conditions and interests to requirements of contemporary painting.</span> <span id="context"> This obviously set up a vast array of problems, discrepancies and diversions. The way through this was to hold on to the idea that these paintings could be images of demons. In many cultures a demon is a hybridised creature made up from the components of other creatures – a kind of horrifically meshed collage. In some instances, even a demon’s voice is multitudinous: “My name is Legion: for we are many’. </span> <span id="how">The lack of an identifiable singular self that the demon has (for we are many) relates to the method of assembling these paintings from disparate voices, more specifically, the paintings are made from images extracted from art market auction house catalogues.</span> <span id="rationale"> This compromised authorship sets up strange correspondences with the demon’s: we are many. There’s a kind of horror in this – a dismantling of authorship that I still don’t understand. It’s not post-modern pastiche but I’m not sure exactly what it is.</span></p>
