<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following three statements? You might be surprised by the feedback!</p>
<p class="lead">(a) Reflective writing should be objective and unemotional.</p>
<p class="lead">(b) You should only write about the positive aspects of your learning development.</p>
<p class="lead">(c) It is important to use lots of reference sources as evidence for your reflection.</p>
<h3>Answers</h3>
<p class="lead">(a) Reflective writing should be objective and unemotional.</h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Agree.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Although you are writing about yourself, your experiences and often your own feelings and responses, it should still be done in an objective and moderate tone. You need to take an analytical stance in reviewing your behaviours or learning. You should not vent your frustrations or merely describe how you felt.</p>

<p class="lead">(b) You should only write about the positive aspects of your learning development.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Disagree.</p>
    <strong>Feedback:</strong> Your learning journey sometimes includes points of confusion or challenge. The important thing is that you are aware of these and that you can formulate strategies to overcome difficulties. Writing honestly about negative aspects of your learning path does not reflect badly on you as a student. Rather, it shows maturity and insight.</p>
<p class="lead">(c) It is important to use lots of reference sources as evidence for your reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Disagree.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Your lecturer may ask you to link your reflection to the literature, but a reflection does not require literature to make it valid. Whereas an essay's claims need to be supported by other sources, a reflection is about your experience or learning. The key source for that is you! Follow your lecturer's requirements, but don't crowd your reflection by including an excessive number of references.</p>

[transcript-accordion]<p>The work ‘70,000 veils’ has taken seven years to make. Of course, initially I didn’t have an idea what the work will look like or what will eventuate in that time. The work in terms of the process, consists of ten thousand still images taken from my travels of four or five years and then these images are taken and then deconstructed layer for layer to form ten thousand different layers, and then those layers are reconfigured and composited again to form 70,000 veils then they’re animated.</p>
<p>What inspires the work: Rūmī, Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī – known as a poet in the West but he was a mystic, a Sufi mystic said, “between the individual and the divine there are 70,000 layers and none between the divine and the individual’, and this inspired me and got me thinking about not just from a metaphysical view but also from physical life. I mean you walk into the work; you can choose not to put on the 3d glasses you can choose to put them on.</p>
<p>For me that that symbolizes life generally – you can walk through life and have a rewarding life and you would never have to think about if there is anything out there, or you can cross a threshold, a rite of passage and behind the work is all the wires and the sticky tape and the glue and the bolts and the nuts, and the wood frame and so on. Essentially, it’s the workings behind the universe, held by nails and bolts.</p>
