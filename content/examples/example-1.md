<h1 class="margin-top-zero">Topic sentences</h1>
<p class="lead">A well-written paragraph contains a topic sentence. A topic sentence controls the main idea discussed in a paragraph. It provides the reader with a summary of the key idea and the point of view the writer is expressing. It is often the first sentence as it acts as an introduction to what follows, making it easier for the reader to follow.</p> 
<p>For the writer, topic sentences help you to ensure that each paragraph relates directly to the assignment topic. They help you to organise your ideas logically and to check that you have included appropriate and relevant support material.</p> 
<h2>Poor example</h2>
<blockquote>  
	<p>RMIT programs enable students to develop successful and appropriate pathways. Programs at RMIT include degree and postgraduate programs in Business, Art & Design, Engineering and Education as well as many other areas. In addition RMIT offers many technical and vocational programs at Certificate and Diploma level. RMIT therefore has a lot to offer its students.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is this paragraph about?</h2>
<p>The topic is that RMIT offers a range of programs. A possible topic sentence could be: "RMIT offers a wide range of programs from Certificate to Post Graduate levels".</p>
<h2>Improved example</h2>
<blockquote>  
	<p>RMIT offers a wide range of programs from Certificate to Postgraduate level. RMIT programs enable students to develop successful and appropriate pathways. Programs at RMIT include degree and postgraduate programs in Business, Art & Design, Engineering and Education as well as many other areas. In addition RMIT offers many technical and vocational programs at Certificate and Diploma level. RMIT therefore has a lot to offer its students</p>
