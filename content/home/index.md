<p class="lead">Whether you are paraphrasing or quoting, integrating the ideas of others with your own argument is an important part of clear, cohesive communication. It’s easy to become repetitive, using ‘this author said’ and ‘that author said’ over and over. Reporting words tell your audience more about a person’s position on a topic, not just that they ‘said’ something.</p>
<h2>Reporting words</h2>
<p>Reporting words are verbs that help us describe an author’s position on a topic. The reporting word you choose can help your audience understand the viewpoint of the original author, or it might express your own opinion about that author’s work. There are many of these words in English, and they all have different meanings. Some are more forceful, while others express a more modest position on a topic.</p>
