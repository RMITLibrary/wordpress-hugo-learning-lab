It was it was like I was, I will see the in-between energies which were surrounding her hands.\r\nMohammed has been a very important influence; she\u2019s been everything to me in my life and I have grown up with her. It\u2019s been a journey with her, however where she\u2019s been working with textiles and with yarns and with threads all her life, for me it was like part of growing up in that environment.\r\nI work with her fibers \u2013 textiles, which are back in my country, which the craftsmen and weavers have been working for years. The techniques I use kind of, they\u2019re invented by us, so they don\u2019t exist in in like history.\r\nAnd it\u2019s not about the textile, it\u2019s about the language. It\u2019s about an abstract language and trying to communicate through the works, of me wanting to search within the answers which I never could resolve in day-to-day living my life so it was more about me wanting to go within \u2013 wanting to ask questions about living, about life, feelings, the physicality, the tactility of the materials, which we are just not aware, which we\u2019ve lost in our day-to-day livings.\r\nSo yes there is a so the process of me doing these works which made me search, you know, different ways which made me engage with textiles in a very different approach.[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nKhaled Sabsabi\r\nExperimenta Recharge 2015, RMIT Gallery\r\n[ll-video url='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UoEw3jbeqKw']\r\n[transcript]The work \u201870,000 veils\u2019 has taken seven years to make. Of course, initially I didn\u2019t have an idea what the work will look like or what will eventuate in that time. The work in terms of the process, consists of ten thousand still images taken from my travels of four or five years and then these images are taken and then deconstructed layer for layer to form ten thousand different layers, and then those layers are reconfigured and composited again to form 70,000 veils then they\u2019re animated.\r\nWhat inspires the work: R\u016bm\u012b, Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b \u2013 known as a poet in the West but he was a mystic, a Sufi mystic said, \u201cbetween the individual and the divine there are 70,000 layers and none between the divine and the individual\u2019, and this inspired me and got me thinking about not just from a metaphysical view but also from physical life. I mean you walk into the work; you can choose not to put on the 3d glasses you can choose to put them on.\r\nFor me that that symbolizes life generally \u2013 you can walk through life and have a rewarding life and you would never have to think about if there is anything out there, or you can cross a threshold, a rite of passage and behind the work is all the wires and the sticky tape and the glue and the bolts and the nuts, and the wood frame and so on.

Even if the feedback is not what you expected, consider it carefully before dismissing it. One of your reviewer\u2019s comments might spark a new idea for your work.\r\nSeek clarification\r\nIf any part of the feedback is unclear, ask for clarification or extra explanation. This will help you get the most out of the suggestions the reviewer made. Clarifying misunderstandings can prevent errors in your work.\r\nWhat if you disagree?\r\nIt\u2019s okay to disagree with feedback, but it\u2019s important to do so respectfully. First, consider the reviewer\u2019s points and decide if they have merit. If you still disagree, you can choose not to implement the suggestions.\r\nExpress gratitude\r\nWhether or not you believe you have received sound feedback, thank your reviewer for the time they took to consider your work. This helps create a positive, collaborative learning environment in your class.\r\nDon't take it personally\r\nThe feedback you receive is about your work, not about you as a person. Try to separate your personal feelings from the critique. This will help you view the feedback objectively and use it to enhance your work. \r\n\r\nIf you are not happy with some of the suggestions, avoid responding in a rude or defensive manner. Try to respond professionally. It is likely that they were trying their best, even if you did not like their advice.","excerpt":"Receiving feedback is a valuable part of the learning process.

This involves providing feedback on other students\u2019 assignments to help them improve their work.\r\n\r\nWhy are peer reviews used?\r\nThese assignments help students develop several important skills. By reviewing your colleagues\u2019 work, you can improve your critical thinking and learn to be an effective communicator, as your feedback should be given in a sensitive and constructive manner.\r\n\r\nPeople can often feel offended when they perceive criticism. By participating in peer reviews within the safe setting of your course, you can learn to accept and integrate suggestions professionally. This helps you understand that feedback is a collaborative approach to learning rather than personal criticism.\r\nHow are peer reviews used in assignments?\r\nThere are a number of ways peer reviews can be used in assignments. Here are the two most common:\r\nPre-submission peer review\r\nIn some assignments, a peer review stage is included before the final submission. This means that after completing a draft, students are expected to provide constructive feedback on their peers\u2019 drafts, highlighting strengths and suggesting areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nOnce a student has received feedback, they then revise their drafts to enhance the quality of their work.\r\n\r\nThis process allows students to improve their work before the final submission and helps them learn from each other, incorporating diverse perspectives.\r\nCollaborative assignments\r\nIn group assignments, peer review can be used to evaluate individual contributions and overall performance within the group. This peer review stage typically occurs during the assignment process, rather than at the end.\r\n\r\nIt can involve:\r\n\r\n \tFeedback on contributions: Students assess the work of their group members, providing constructive comments on their contributions.\r\n \tA performance review: This may also include providing feedback on their performance and collaboration within the group assignment.\r\n\r\nWhat is expected?\r\nIn assignments with a peer review stage, you are expected to engage actively and thoughtfully in the process. This means providing constructive feedback on your peer\u2019s work and being open to receiving feedback on your own. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone benefits from shared insights and constructive criticism.\r\nProvide feedback\r\nThis involves reading your peer\u2019s assignment thoroughly and assessing it based on the criteria provided by your instructor. You will need to comment on various aspects such as content, structure, and clarity. Your goal is to help your peer improve their work by offering insights and suggestions.\r\nComplete a form \/ submit feedback\r\nWhile you are reviewing your peer\u2019s assignment, you will need to complete a feedback form, which you will often be asked to submit to your class instructor. This form will guide you in structuring your feedback and ensuring it covers all necessary areas.\r\nReceive feedback\r\nThis involves reviewing the comments and suggestions provided by your peer. You will need to read through their feedback carefully to understand their perspective and identify areas for improvement.\r\nAction feedback\r\nhis requires making revisions to your assignment based on the feedback you received. This step involves critically evaluating the suggestions and incorporating changes to enhance the quality of your work. The revised assignment is then prepared for final submission.","excerpt":"During your time at university, you may be asked to complete an assignment that includes a peer review stage.

But how does it work? This page explains how text and images are produced by AI.\r\n\r\nHow does an AI tool generate text?\r\nTools that generate text are a type of AI called a \u2018large language model\u2019 (LLM). They have this name because they are large, very complex computer programs that are fed billions of words of text (a process called \u2018training\u2019) until they become good at understanding the patterns of language\u2014not only grammatical patterns, but also which words and phrases are related to each other and how they tend to appear together in a text.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask one of these tools a question, it analyses your question and tries to answer you based on the patterns it knows. These generative-text tools are based on statistical models of language patterns, so as they write your answer, they are continually analysing probabilities to guess which word or phrase is most likely to appear next in a piece of clear and coherent writing.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to understand that LLMs are not search engines. While they can make it sound like they have all the answers because they\u2019re so good at writing convincing language, they don\u2019t actually \u2018know\u2019 anything. They are simply writing the most reasonable response based on probability. This is why they don\u2019t always provide accurate information, and why some tools are unable to provide sources for the ideas in their writing.\r\nHow does an AI tool generate an image?\r\nLike generative-text tools, AI tools that create images based on a text description are trained on very large sets of data until they\u2019ve learned what patterns make an image look realistic\u2014for example, the usage of colour, texture and lighting, and the way objects are arranged\u2014as well as what text descriptions match different types of images.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/images\/AI-tools-image2.jpg\" portrait=\"true\" caption=\"Image generated using NightCafe from the prompt 'two students holding hands on a university campus in the style of a colour portrait'.

Just like generative-text tools, they sometimes produce strange results because they do not understand anything about what the real world actually looks like\u2014they are simply mimicking the visual patterns of millions of other images.

We call this an identity.\r\n\r\nTrigonometric identities\r\nTo show that \\(\\tan x=\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) , you can recall that\r\nin any right angled triangle, the sides of the triangle can be named.\r\nThe longest side is called the hypotenuse (abbreviated as \\(Hyp\\)),\r\nwe also have the side opposite a given angle (\\(Opp\\)) and the side\r\nadjacent to the angle (\\(Adj\\)).\r\n\r\n\\(\\sin\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{O}pp}{\\boldsymbol{H}yp}\\)\r\n\\(\\cos\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{A}dj}{\\boldsymbol{H}yp}\\) \\(\\tan\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{O}pp}{\\boldsymbol{A}dj}\\)\r\n\r\nTherefore \\(\\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}=\\dfrac{\\frac{Opp}{Hyp}}{\\frac{Adj}{Hyp}}=\\frac{Opp}{Adj}=\\tan\\theta\\)\r\n\r\nAnother identity, sometimes referred to as the fundamental trigonometric\r\nidentity, can be derived from the unit circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying Pythagoras\u2019 theorem to the right angled triangle within the\r\nunit circle we find that \\(\\left(\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)^{2}=1^{2}\\)\r\n, that is:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\sin^{2}\\theta+\\cos^{2}\\theta &amp;

This module defines the trigonometric functions using angles in a unit circle.\r\nThe unit circle\r\nA unit circle is a circle that is centered at the origin and has a radius of one as shown below. The origin is the point with co-ordinates \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\) \r\n\r\n\r\nAn angle measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis maybe used to define any point on the unit circle. Angles may be positive or negative. Positive angles are in an anti-clockwise direction. and negative angles are in a clockwise direction as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle, it is possible to to rotate through more than \\(360^{\\circ}\\). For example a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}\\) identifies the same point as a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}=405^{\\circ}\\).\r\nAngular measurement and the unit circle\r\nThough angles are often measured in degrees, they may also be measured in radians. One radian is the angle subtended from the \\(x-\\) axis by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. In a unit circle , the radius is \\(1\\). This is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the figure, the red arc is of length \\(1\\) and is the same length as the radius. The angle formed is one radian. Radians are abbreviated as rad or a superscript \\(c\\) like \\(^{c}\\).\r\n\r\nSince the circumference of the unit circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians and there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle we have \\[ 360^{\\circ}=2\\pi\\textrm{ rad.} \\]\r\nThe circumference formula is \\(C=2\\pi r\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius. Since \\(r=1\\) in a unit circle, we see the circumference is \\(2\\pi\\).\r\n\r\nBy dividing the above equation by a number it is possible to derive the following angles in degrees in terms of radians as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} 30^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ 45^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\ 60^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ 90^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ 180^{\\circ} &amp; =\\pi\\\\ 150^{\\circ} &amp; =5\\times30^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =5\\times\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\\\ 270^{\\circ} &amp; =3\\times90^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =3\\times\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\pi}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Angles in radians may also be positive and negative. The same convention is used as for degrees, a positive rotation is anti-clockwise and a negative rotation is clockwise.\r\nSine and cosine on the unit circle\r\nImagine a point \\(P\\left(x,y\\right)\\) on the unit circle as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the triangle \\(POQ\\), the hypotenuse \\(OP\\) is \\(1\\), the adjacent side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(OQ\\) and the opposite side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(QP\\). Using the definitions of sine and cosine in a right angled triangle we get Remember that \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}. \\end{align*}\\]  \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{OQ}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{1}\\\\ &amp; =x \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{QP}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{y}{1}\\\\ &amp; =y \\end{align*}\\]\r\nThat is, any point on the unit circle has coordinates \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\cos\\theta\\\\ y &amp; =\\sin\\theta \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle (positive or negative) measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis to the point.\r\n\r\nExamples: \\(\\sin\\left(0\\right)=0\\) , \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\sin\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) , \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(0\\right)=1,\\) \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\) cos \\(\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=0\\).\r\nThe tangent function\r\nConsider the figure below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe triangles \\(OMN\\) and \\(OQP\\) are similar therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{MN}{OM} &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ}\\\\ MN &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ} &amp; since\\ OM=1 \\end{align*}\\] \\(OM=1\\) (it is a unit circle). We define the length \\(MN\\) to be the tangent of the angle \\(\\theta\\) We call this the tangent as it is the distance measured on the vertical tangent to the circle that passes through the point \\(\\left(1,0\\right)\\).\r\n and abbreviate this to \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\). Also \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)=PQ\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)=OQ.\\) Substituting these relationships into equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(\\theta\\right) &amp; =\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] This agrees with the usual definition of tan from right angled trigonometry.\r\nExact values of sine, cosine and tangent functions\r\nTo find the value of \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right),\\,\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) and \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) we usually use a scientific calculator.\r\nWhen using the calculator it is essential that it be in degrees or radians mode. However, there are some special angles that are worth remembering. These are shown in the following table.\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\nAngle \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0^{\\circ}\\)\r\n\\(30^{\\circ}=\\pi\/6\\)\r\n\\(45^{\\circ}=\\pi\/4\\)\r\n\\(60^{\\circ}=\\pi\/3\\)\r\n\\(90^{\\circ}=\\pi\/2\\)\r\n\\(180^{\\circ}=\\pi\\)\r\n\\(270^{\\circ}=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sin\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\r\n1\r\n0\r\n-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\cos\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\r\n0\r\n-1\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\tan\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\)\r\n1\r\n\\(\\sqrt{3}\\)\r\nundefined\r\n0\r\nundefined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know the exact values above, you can work out the exact values for other angles using the symmetry of the unit circle.\r\nQuadrants\r\nThe coordinate plane is divided into an upper and lower section by the \\(x\\) -axis. It is further divided into quadrants by the \\(y\\) -axis. These four quadrants are numbered from one to four in an anti-clockwise direction as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing exact values for some angles in quadrant 1, allows you to find exact values in other quadrants.\r\nExample 1: Find the exact value of \\(\\sin\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\).\r\nSolution: It is important to make a sketch as shown below. Remember \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}=120^{\\circ}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst draw in the angle you are interested in. In this case it is \\(2\\pi\/3\\) and is shown in blue as are the required values for the circular functions sin and cos. Now use symmetry of the unit circle about the \\(y-\\) axis to draw in an angle that is related to \\(2\\pi\/3\\) but for which you know the exact value. In this case it is \\(\\pi\/3\\) and is shown in red. You can see that the length of \\(NQ\\) is the same as \\(MP\\) which means \\[\\begin{align*} NQ &amp; =MP\\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\nNow note that the the lengths of \\(ON\\) and \\(MO\\) are the same but \\(MO=-ON=-\\cos\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =-ON\\\\ &amp; =-\\cos\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\nExample 2: Find the exact value of \\(\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right)\\).\r\nPlotting \\(330^{\\circ}\\) on a unit circle shows that \\(\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right)\\) is closely related to \\(\\sin\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right).\\) The \\(y-\\) coordinates differ only by sign because the distances from the \\(x-\\) axis are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} MP &amp; =-MQ\\\\ \\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; =-\\sin\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\nNote: \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; =\\cos\\left(360^{\\circ}-30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\nExample 3: Find the exact value of \\(\\tan\\left(4\\pi\/3\\right)\\).\r\nPlotting \\(4\\pi\/3\\) on a unit circle shows that \\(\\tan\\left(4\\pi\/3\\right)\\) is closely related to \\(\\tan\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nRemember \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}=\\frac{3\\pi}{3}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}=\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tWhat are the coordinates for points on the unit circle that make the following angles with the positive \\(x-\\) axis?\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,30^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; b)\\,125^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; c)\\:-60^{\\circ}\\\\ d)\\,270^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; e)\\,-180^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; f)\\,720^{\\circ} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n \tFind exact values for:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; b)\\,\\cos\\left(210^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; c)\\,\\sin\\left(-30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ d)\\,\\cos\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; e)\\,\\tan\\left(300^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; f)\\,\\cos\\left(180^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ g)\\,\\sin\\left(-120^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; h)\\,\\cos\\left(315^{\\circ}\\right) \\end{array}\\]\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llllll} a)\\:\\left(cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right),sin\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)=\\left(0.87,0.5\\right)\\ \\ \\ &amp; b)\\,\\left(-0.56,0.82\\right)\\ \\ \\ &amp; c)\\,\\left(0.5,-0.87\\right)\\ \\ \\ &amp; d)\\,\\left(0,-1\\right)\\ \\ &amp; e)\\,\\left(-1,0\\right)\\ \\ \\ &amp; f)\\,\\left(1,0\\right)\\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llllll} a)\\,0.5\\ \\ \\ &amp; b)\\,\\sqrt{3}\/2\\ \\ \\ &amp; c)\\,-0.5 &amp; \\ \\ \\ d)\\,0 &amp; \\ \\ \\ e)\\,\\sqrt{3} &amp; \\ \\ \\ f)\\,-1\\\\ g)\\,-\\sqrt{3}\/2 &amp; h)\\,1\/\\sqrt{2} \\end{array}\\]\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\nDownload this page, FG6 Circular Functions (PDF 1179KB)  \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"The trigonometric ratios that have been defined in right-angled triangles can be extended to angles greater than 90 degrees Trigonometric functions such as sin, cos and tan are usually defined as the ratios of sides in a right angled triangle.

Do you feel like you spend too much time reading the wrong texts? On this page, we will learn about active reading- a reading technique designed to help you get more out of your reading experience.\r\n\r\nGetting started with active reading\r\nActive reading means making choices about what you read and how you read, and different strategies should be used for different texts. Here are some things to take into consideration:\r\nHave a purpose in mind when you read\r\nSome purposes for reading are learning about new concepts in depth, searching for topics to include in an assignment, and looking for information to support a specific point.\r\n\r\nHow much will you read?\r\nIf the article or book is a core text, then you may decide to read it from cover to cover while taking notes. However, if you are searching for specific information, surveying, skimming, and scanning techniques may be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nHow does it relate to other texts\r\nIf you find that a text has a connection to something else you have read, then as an active reader you would make note of this. As time passes and you read more texts, it is easy to forget this type of detail.\r\n\r\nTake notes and keep organised\r\nActive readers take notes as they read and represent their information in visual ways, such as using tables, diagrams, and mind maps. They also organise the notes from their readings into logical filing systems, and they write summaries of texts so that no information will be lost.\r\n\r\nEvaluating the text\r\nGet to know the writer\r\nGetting to know the author can tell you a lot about the purpose of the text. Check their affiliations, that is, any companies, groups or parties that they are associated with. For example, an article written about the benefits of cow\u2019s milk by the CEO of a dairy company should not be the only source used if you are discussing the health impact of dairy products.\r\nThink about the title\r\nThe title of a text can give you useful information about the writer\u2019s purpose, tone, and attitude. Compare the two titles below and consider the information they reveal about the writer:\r\n\r\n    Title 1: The effects of social media usage on adolescent mental health\r\n    Title 2: How social media is disrupting the lives of today's teens\r\n\r\nYou may have identified that the first title is objective. In other words, it does not indicate a bias from the author, and it is probable that the author will be reporting on the observations they have uncovered through the course of their study. On the other hand, title 2 appears to be more subjective, and could be more based on the author's personal feelings.\r\nCritical thinking\r\nActive readers evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the text as they go. To do this, they may ask themselves questions such as:\r\n\r\n    Has the article\/report fulfilled its purpose?\r\n    Is the argument clearly stated and supported by evidence?\r\n    Is the research valid? (Sufficient, appropriate, adequate, objective, valid methodology?)\r\n    Has the argument been developed logically?\r\n    Does it present solutions based on evidence?\r\n    Are recommendations appropriate to the purpose?\r\n    Has the article\/book been published by a reputable publisher?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's test your knowledge of active reading\r\n","excerpt":"Have you ever read something without really absorbing it?

This involves researching three key areas:\r\n\r\n \tResearch your topic. If you are unsure of your content you will not be able to speak confidently. Make sure your topic is specific enough to have a clear focus so you can identify the key ideas and concepts. It should also be broad enough to be interesting and engaging.\r\n \tResearch your audience. Your presentation should engage everyone not just your lecturer\/teacher. Does my audience need more background information on my topic? What are the expectations of my\u00a0talk?\r\n \tResearch the venue. Make sure you check where you will be standing, the seating arrangements and any equipment that you will be using such as data projectors, etc.\r\n\r\nPlan and organise\r\nAfter you have researched it is important to carefully plan and organise your information.

This short video walks you through easy steps for analysing assessment tasks, reading and taking notes, and planning assignments.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/UhKAaCs2lSY\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nPlanning an assignment.\r\n\r\nWhen you get an assignment, it is not effective just to sit down and write. You need to plan, and here are three important steps for planning an assignment.\r\n\r\nYou need to analyse the task, so that you know exactly what you are being asked to do. You need to read and take notes in an organised way. And, you need to plan the structure of your writing.\r\n\r\nFirst, read the task really carefully to work out what the topic is and how they want you to write the assignment. Here is an example. First, find the topic through the content words. Then, look for instructional words that tell you how to write the assignment.\r\n\r\nNow, think carefully about what this means. Having two instructional words in the question probably means two parts to the essay. It\u2019s helpful to rewrite the question in your own words to really understand it. Getting it right at this point can save a lot of pain later on. Then, you need to find all the information you need. You need to read a lot and take notes. This takes lots of time. This is why you cannot leave things to the last minute.\r\n\r\nRead the general stuff first, and then the more specific. Reading generally is really important if you are not familiar with the topic. Start with books. Academic journal articles tend to be quite specific \u2013 these need some general understanding before you read them. Writing notes is important, too, because it helps you remember. But you need to keep your notes organised so you can easily find information and the sources they come from.\r\n\r\nHere is a system. The left-hand margin is for scanning the page, and if you organise it like this, you can keep a record of your references. Once you have all the information you need, plan by using a mind map. Mind maps have three steps: (1) brainstorm everything you know about the topic, (2) group, prioritise, and maybe even delete some of the ideas, (3) organise all of this and show the connections between the ideas.\r\n\r\nBut the last step in planning is turning this mind map into a linear plan. Work out the structure of the body first before any other section. This can take a lot of thought. Work from big structures like sections, to finer structures like paragraphs, finding the most logical order for everything can be quite tricky, too. After all of this is done, then write your assignment.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\nSlam your assignment: plan it, research it, write it\r\nThis short tutorial gives you an overview of the process of\u00a0planning,\u00a0researching\u00a0and\u00a0writing\u00a0an assignment with quick links to the resources you can use at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Plan it\" heading_level=\"h3\"]Not all assignments are the same, so the first step is to understand what type of assignment you are doing, and what you are being asked to do.\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/getting-started\/getting-started-home-1@2x.png\" float=\"true\" hide-sm=\"true\" alt=\"\" attribution-id=\"my-attribution\"][\/ll-image]\r\nStart by understanding your assignment. Assignment details can usually be found in the assignments section of your course's Canvas shell. If have any issues locating this, contact your tutor, lecturer, or teacher.\r\n\r\nRead the assignment instructions and rubric to know what is required and what markers are looking for. Find tips for doing this on the Learning Lab's understand the assignment page.\r\n\r\nWhat if you have to do something you haven\u2019t done before? In the assessment section of the Learning Lab there are guides to different assignment types such as literature reviews, reports and presentations.\r\n\r\nNext, think about what you already know about the subject and what you have learnt in your lectures. This is a good time to go back over your lecture notes and review lecture recordings, if you have access to them.\r\n\r\nNow, you can move on to doing some brainstorming to generate ideas for your assignment.

To understand what is meant by this, visit the why can\u2019t I just google it? and what is scholarly information? pages.\r\n\r\nThe RMIT Library home page is a great place to start your search for information- you can use LibrarySearch and access an extensive list of databases and journals. Remember to log in for full access to resources.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to search for information in your subject area, you can use the Library\u2019s subject guides which provide lists of databases and links to useful resources for specific subject areas.\r\n\r\nIf you run into any issues or would like to speak to someone about finding or evaluating information, you can connect with a Librarian via the AskTheLibrary chat widget on the Library's home page.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Writing your assignment\" heading-tag=\"h3\"]\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/getting-started\/getting-started-home-3@2x.png\" float=\"true\" hide-sm=\"true\" alt=\"\" attribution-id=\"my-attribution\"][\/ll-image]\r\nWhen it comes to writing your assignment, remember that you can learn about how to structure your work in the assessments section of the Learning Lab.\r\n\r\nFor tips on how to organise your information, check out the writing paragraphs and writing sentences pages. For general information on the features of formal writing, visit the academic style page.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to including the research you have done into your work, you can find advice in the referencing section of the Learning Lab about how to integrate ideas, paraphrase, quote and more.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[attribution id=\"my-attribution\" hide-sm=\"true\"][\/attribution]","excerpt":"Planning and organising your first assignment may seem daunting to students who are new to academic study.

A caption can be added using caption=\"Insert caption here\". Simple html markup can be used within the caption. Elements such as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; can help with basic formatting.\r\n\r\nFor learning lab, we have a default attribution for use with images made from scratch:\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/landing\/assessments.png\" caption=\"Image title|attrib\" alt=\"An example image\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\nTo automatically generate this, use the following code: caption=\"Image title|attrib\"\r\n\r\nLinks can also be used, be careful to use single quotes around the url asthe whole caption itself is wrapped in double quotes. \r\n\r\nFor diagram images where the background is white, the caption can appear too close to the bototm of the image. To alleviate this, add the attribute caption-gap=\"lg\". This increaes the padding between the bottom of the image and the caption. \r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/case-studies\/case-study-read-the-case@2x.png\" alt=\"A document with highlighted, underlined and circled text with annotations in the margins.\" caption=\"Highlight, underline and circle text|attrib\" caption-gap=\"lg\" size=\"wide\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscripts\r\n\r\nTranscripts are a way to provide an accessible alternative to an image, where a longer description is required that can be provided by an alt tag. To add a transcript, place a &lbrack;transcript&rbrack; shortcode in between the &lbrack;ll-image&rbrack; shortcode. Find out more information about the transcript shortcode.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/landing\/assessments.png\" caption=\"An example caption|attrib\" alt=\"An example image\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Ensure there's more paragraph text than the height of the image at a screen size of 1400px wide. If this works, the wrap will be effective at other screen sizes too. \r\n\r\n    By default, floated content has a width of 296px. \r\n    On smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the image is displayed at full width.\r\n    Image should be placed before supporting content\r\n\tDue to the narrow width, use the attrbution shortcode to handle attribution.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/landing\/assessments.png\" float=\"true\" caption=\"An example caption for this image.\" alt=\"An example image\"][\/ll-image]\r\nThe figure in this example uses the float=true attribute.

To alter this, there are two options:\r\n\r\nAdd hide-sm=\"true\" to the shortcode. This is only useful if the image is purely decorative.\r\nAdd size=\"sm\" to the shortcode. This reduces the width of the image to 160px and maintains the float across all screen sizes.\r\n\r\nResize your screen to see this behaviour in action on the following examples\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/images\/1474StevenRendallImage1.jpg\" float=\"true\" size=\"sm\" alt=\"An example image\"][\/ll-image]\r\nThe figure in this example uses the size=\"sm\" attribute to reduce the size of the floated image.

And that would be, for instance, giving an assignment.   For instance having been asked to do a literature review on a topic, it's not just a question of reviewing the literature and putting the views together or organising them. On top of that you've got to critique them, and state what you think, what are your views given all the evidence, or all the opinions, or what do you question, what do you support, and why. What could have been better. A topic that may have been given, you really have to always think OK was that really good? Could you have done well without it, why did somebody come up with such a theory, and was it really necessary or they just didn't have anything else to do. It's things like that, and it can be demanding especially when you are used to just pointing out facts.   Now having to go further and think about those facts, and teach you something from it can be quite a task. [\/lightweight-accordion]  [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Thinking critically that is again an issue for most international students.   I always thought that what the educationalists, the academics are saying, that is it. I don't have the capacity to actually criticise that, or to add something to it, I should just believe it as such, and for me it was really different, and when I started writing, I realised that there was so much that I had to say. And that what I had to say was also important.   And it really helped me in doing my other assignments as well, because it developed that kind of critical monologue within myself so it was really helpful, I think. [\/lightweight-accordion]  [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] When I recall my learning experience, I think there are two points that should be adjusted for international students who come from an Eastern educational background.   The first one is reading with critical eyes. Eastern culture emphasises to obey 'big man's sayings', so some of us are very willing to receive an expert's opinion than think they are ready too .. but not give our own ideas, and I always forget to collect evidence as I am reading. [\/lightweight-accordion]  [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Critical thinking is something that they talk a lot about.   It's more your ability to show that you have read widely, I mean lots of literature, and that you can hold the different literature up against each other, and say that this is where they have stuff in common, this where they are different, and build on that theory.   Generally when they ask for critical thinking it's your ability to analyse the literature.

This page has tips for how you can integrate information from other authors into your work.\r\nIt takes practice to integrate multiple ideas and information into your writing. Every source you cite should support your argument, therefore the skills of summarising and synthesising are also important.\r\nDirect quotations and paraphrasing\r\nUse a mix of direct quotations and paraphrasing.\r\n\r\n \tDirect quotations are when you use the author's exact words. These require quotation marks and in-text references. Direct quotations should be used sparingly.\r\n \tParaphrasing is the restatement, in your own words, of other authors' works. These also require in-text references. Paraphrasing allows your own 'voice' to be heard in the text.\r\n\r\nThe example below uses Harvard style from EasyCite.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntegrating visual references\r\nReferring to visual images in your essay means you will need to reference these images as you would reference other evidence.\r\n\r\nThe examples below have used the RMIT Harvard referencing guide. Note how the examples also include a reference to the thumbnail images (Figure 1 &amp; Figure 2).\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nBy 1968, demand for changes ... contributed to a global expectation of rebellion ... socio-political tensions surrounding the Vietnam War emerged (Paradis et al. 2013). Weingart started using more organic and emotional shapes, such as the Issue 11, 1973 cover for TM (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c), where the typography is all but obscured by spaces which could be interpreted as bullet holes (Figure 1). The increasing awareness of global complexity and social turmoil encouraged experimentalism ...\r\nExample 2\r\nWeingart believed that for a designer to truly realise their personal typographic ideas, they must first explore all potential design paths via experimentation \u2026 Weingart's 1973 TM cover design for Issue 2 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.b) used Ruder's 'Grotesque' type design, but gave it movement and perspective, turning words into images (Figure 2). His 'idea was to teach more than typography...I had to bring graphic design \u2026 I created a bridge between typography and graphic design' (Weingart cited in Paradis 2011a, para. 126).\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual images (such as a thumbnail images) incorporated into your essay also require a caption that includes the figure number, the title or a description of the work and an in-text citation. Include a full reference to the thumbnail image in your reference list.\r\n\r\nThe RMIT Harvard referencing guide for visual material was used in the examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Cover design by Wolfgang Weingart for Typografische Monatsblatter, Issue 11, 1973 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Cover design by Wolfgang Weingart for Typografische Monatsblatter, Issue 2, 1973 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.b).\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography and reference list\r\nYour reference list is placed at the end of your assignment, on a separate page(s). Only include in the reference list all of the references that you have cited in the text of your assignment.\r\n\r\nThe example below uses the RMIT Library Harvard referencing guide, note how:\r\n\r\n \tthe reference list is arranged alphabetically by author's surname\r\n \tthe format for each entry depends on the location of the source, e.g. article, book, website\r\n\r\nReference list\r\nAynsley, J 2001, Pioneers of modern graphic design: a complete history, Mitchell Beazley, London.\r\n\r\nBerman, F 1963, 'Uber das zeitgemase', Typografische Monatsblatter, vol. 32, no. 6\/7, p. 446.\r\n\r\nBurton \u00a0P 2013, Wolfgang Weingart, AIGA - the professional association for design, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.aiga.org\/medalist-wolfgang-weingart\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nHeller, S 2004, Cult of the ugly, Typotheque, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;https:\/\/www.typotheque.com\/articles\/cult_of_the_ugly&gt;.\r\n\r\nHeller, S 2005, Wolfgang Weingart: making the young generation nuts, AIGA - the professional association for design, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.aiga.org\/wolfgang-weingart-making-the-young-generation-nuts\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nHollis, R 2006, Swiss graphic design: the origins and growth of an international style, 1920-1965, Laurence King Publishing, London.\r\n\r\nKelley, G 2015, Wolfgang Weingart, GregoryKelley, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www2.palomar.edu\/users\/gkelley\/Weingart.html&gt;.\r\n\r\nMeggs, P &amp; Alston, P 2011, Meggs' history of graphic design, 5th edn, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nParadis, L \u00a02010, Interview with April Grieman, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/interviews\/april-greiman\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nParadis, L \u00a02011a, Interview with Wolfgang Weingart, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/interviews\/wolfgang-weingart\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nParadis, L 2011b, Interview with Helmut Schmid, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/interviews\/helmut-schmid%E2%80%8A\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nParadis, L, Fruh, R, Rappo, F &amp; Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne 2013, 30 Years of Swiss Typographic Discourse in the Typografische Monatsblatter: TM RSI SGM 1960-90, 1st edn, Lars Muller Publishers, Zurich.\r\n\r\nSchwemer-Schebbin, Y 1991,Reputations: Wolfgang Weingart, Eye, Summer edn., viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.eyemagazine.com\/feature\/article\/reputations-wolfgang-weingart&gt;.\r\n\r\nTM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.a, 1972 Issue 5 - Cover design: Wolfgang Weingart, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/issue\/1972-5\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nTM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.b, 1973 Issue 2 - Cover design: Wolfgang Weingart, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/issue\/1973-2\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nTM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c, 1973 Issue 11 - Cover design: Wolfgang Weingart, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/issue\/1973-11\/&gt;.\r\n\r\nVilliger, C 2013, 'Political violence: Switzerland, a special case?', Terrorism and political violence, vol. 25, no. 5, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/09546553.2012.677878&gt;.\r\n\r\nWeingart, W 1985 'My typography instruction at the Basle school of design\/Switzerland, 1968 to 1985', Design Quarterly, no. 130, pp. 1-20, viewed 1 July 2015, JSTOR.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"At postgraduate level you are expected to refer to a wide range sources as evidence of the depth of your reading.

Learn more about the way universities are structured and the types of study programs that are available, as well as the role of research at a university.\r\n\r\nOrganisation of university activities\r\nA university is generally led by the Vice-Chancellor and governed by the council and the academic board. Each university has their own values, policies, and legislation developed according to the national standards, which they obey and respect.\r\n\r\nUniversities are comprised of academic bodies and operational and strategic bodies. Academic bodies deliver the university's major teaching, learning and research services. Tertiary institutions have different names for academic bodies, which may include college, faculty, portfolio. These academic bodies are named and categorised based on the study program that they offer. A college or faculty generally comprises several schools or departments. All courses and programs are coordinated by the school, which is part of the college\/faculty. Students may not need to know which college or school they're part of, though it may help when they're engaging with university services.\r\n\r\nTertiary institutions facilitate teaching, learning, research, and community engagement across a wide range of disciplines. Teaching and learning are conducted via different levels of study programs offered to students via national and international university campuses and in some cases from a fully online service.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy programs\r\nTertiary institutions offer a wide range of study programs ranging from vocational education and higher education to postgraduate education in many disciplines.\r\nPre-university study\r\nSome tertiary institutions provide pre-university study programs for domestic and international students to prepare them for tertiary studies or students who require extra support to get into a university-level program or who are keen to brush up their skills before starting at the university level. These programs may include:\r\nVocational study\r\nMany Australian universities offer a wide variety of vocational education or TAFE (technical and further education) programs, such as certificate programs, diplomas and advanced diplomas. Most of these programs help you to get into the degree of your interest such as associate degrees and bachelor degrees.\r\nUndergraduate study\r\nAssociate degrees, bachelor degrees and honours degrees offered by tertiary education institutes are considered undergraduate degrees. Most Australian universities offer undergraduate degree programs in STEM, business, law, education, social science, etc. Check out the web page of your chosen university for specific admission details.\r\nAssociate degrees\r\nAssociate degrees are two-year programs that combine both theoretical and practical knowledge, with a significant focus on work-based learning. This is a stand-alone qualification to enter the workforce as well as a pathway to enter a relevant bachelor degree. Universities offer associate degrees in many areas of study, including applied science, engineering science, graphic design, professional writing and editing, health sciences, screen and media production and more.\r\nBachelor degrees\r\nBachelor degrees are usually three-year study programs with a focus on both theory and practice. However, some professional degrees can take up to four or five years, depending on the study discipline. These degrees are open to both domestic and international students.\r\nHonours degree\r\nThe honours degree is a one-year specialised study that is generally undertaken upon the completion of the bachelor degree. Typically, students are required to have a high GPA from a bachelor to enter an honours degree. With an honours degree, you specialise in a specific area of your discipline. This degree is comprised of a larger portion of research or placement and coursework components. Honours degrees generally prepare you for masters by research or doctoral degree. You can undertake an honours degree in a different university than your bachelor degree. However, entry requirements can vary in different universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostgraduate studies by coursework\r\nA postgraduate program is generally any study that you undertake upon completion of your bachelor degree. Occasionally with extensive industry experience, you might be eligible to undertake a postgraduate program without a bachelor degree. Many tertiary education institutes offer different levels of postgraduate programs: graduate certificates, graduate diplomas and masters. In some cases, graduate certificates and diplomas can provide a pathway to enter a masters degree.\r\nResearch degrees\r\nResearch degrees are master and doctoral degrees across many disciplines. These programs are comprehensive research conducted independently under the guidance of an expert academic, which is called a supervisor. You can conduct research as a thesis model or project model, depending on the discipline of study. Masters by research degrees are two years of full-time work, and PhDs are four years of full-time work.\r\nOnline courses\r\nSome universities offer fully online short courses, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in many study areas. The core study areas include artificial intelligence, design, marketing, business and finance, health, science and engineering, data analytics and information technology.\r\nRecognised prior learning\r\nRecognised prior learning (also known as Credit) is the recognition of previous study or learning that can be counted towards a current program.\r\n\r\nThis can reduce the number of units (courses) needed to complete your program, which means the length and cost of your studies are reduced and you don't need to spend time learning things you already know.\r\n\r\nYou can use a variety of documentation to apply for RPL such as records of completed training or a letter from an employer.\r\nResearch\r\nResearch and innovation are a major part of an university culture. Research conducted at a tertiary education level is primarily focused on solving problems encountered nationally and globally in industry, government and community by applying new knowledge and innovation. Researchers in a university collaborate with the industry, government, business sector, hospitals, various research and academic institutions nationally and internationally to conduct impactful research. A university has some staff entirely dedicated to research. Research-focused staff include higher degrees by research students, research assistants, postdoctoral researchers, senior research fellows and research team leaders. Most lecturers also conduct research together with their teaching role. Your lecturer might be a researcher as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nImages by kiattisak, .shock and Monkey Business on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"Navigating any space is easier when you understand how it's organised.

While secondary school does some of the work to prepare you for the world of work and study, higher education expects more of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHabits, good and bad\r\nA habit is a tendency of your behaviour that repeats until it starts to happen automatically. Good habits take some time to form and might be difficult at first, until we do them daily without thinking.\r\n\r\nMany of the study habits you form at university will develop in the same way, but they will support you through the rest of your life so it's never too early to explore ways of working that suit you. You'll have a range of class and assessment types, and teaching styles also vary. It's worth keeping an open mind that one way of studying may not suit all classes and assessment types.\r\nSelf-direction, doing it yourself\r\nA key factor in being a success in your studies will be your ability to be self-directed. You may not have immediate access to teachers to answer questions, or there may be a shortage of support services when you need them most. Assessment periods at your institution often mean that everyone needs help at the same time. Organising your time, developing good habits early and having a 'Plan B' for some of the challenges presented will ensure that you're ready for anything.\r\nPulling it all together with a portfolio\r\nA portfolio is a collection of documents and pieces of work that best represent your achievements. It's a record of your academic accomplishments and progress, as well as professional development and reflections on your work.\r\n\r\nYour studies are intended to change you in ways that help you develop the skills and potential to be a success. This progress can be demonstrated by a compilation of your best assessments and related material and activities throughout your studies, providing evidence of your progression and success.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a portfolio like this can help you maintain confidence and can support your learning and capability post-study. After graduation, you may want to use it for seeking further study or employment.

Take an independent approach in managing class timetables, attending classes, and reading course materials before class.\r\n\r\nIf you need an extra hand to improve your study skills, there are supports available for you to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn actively\r\nActive learning is another core skill in tertiary study. In active learning, you take active control of your study by choosing the suitable learning strategies that make study meaningful for you. These active learning strategies vary but can include:\r\n\r\n \tunderstanding, assessing and questioning information\r\n \tfinding tricks and tips to help you get more organised\r\n \treading additional resources beyond required readings\r\n \tdeveloping a habit of reading, understanding, writing, synthesising materials.\r\n\r\nFind out more about how to take an active learning approach.\r\nThink critically\r\nYou'll use critical thinking in higher education to read, assess, question, challenge and consider the pros and cons of the information and opinions you encounter in your research and study. This skill can be developed once you have considered the different viewpoints of an issue. Critical thinking can help you stand out from the crowd in your class and in the workplace.\r\n\r\nVisit Critical thinking to practise your knowledge.\r\nLearn collaboratively\r\nIt's essential to learn to work collaboratively with others. Expect that you will study within the constraints of different class groups. You may be in a class of 300 or 25, and it's likely that you'll participate in group work. How you work within different class sizes and in groups might impact your approach with your peers.\r\n\r\nGet prepared for collaborative learning with tips at Group work which will help you with completing class discussion activities or assessments when several students are contributing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn with integrity\r\nIn tertiary study you are expected to work with a high level of academic integrity. Academic integrity is defined as being when the \"wider academic community is built on shared values and norms of behaviour, including honesty, fairness and responsibility\" (La Trobe University 2023:para. 1). This integrity requirement applies to you as an active member of the academic community. You can demonstrate your knowledge and adherence to academic integrity rules by attending to and applying these points to your study:\r\n\r\n \tbe honest, fair and respectful in all academic activities, from completing your assignments to sitting exams\r\n \temploy good academic practice, whether you are working alone or with a group of classmates\r\n \tensure your work, both individual and collaborative, acknowledges any information that has influenced your thinking. This includes everything from books and articles, to websites and images\r\n \ttake personal responsibility for ensuring you act appropriately in your studies\r\n \tunderstand that these practices are applicable to the whole academic community, including students, staff and other professionals.\r\n\r\nLearn more about academic integrity and RMIT policies around academic integrity.\r\nReferencing\r\nIn tertiary study you'll learn how to acknowledge other people's ideas in your work by using referencing. You'll need to reference the source(s) both in your writing (in-text citation) and at the end of your writing (in a bibliography or reference list).\r\n\r\nReferencing styles vary from one discipline to another, so it's good to check with your teachers which style is used in your course. Visit Easy Cite for a list of referencing styles. If you don't have much experience with referencing, it's good to know that it takes time to master all the formats of your style \u2013 you don't need be an expert right away. Library staff are experts in referencing and can help you.\r\nTime management\r\nIt's common to have commitments beyond studying, such as work, family, and social life, that require your time. It is good to keep in mind that if you do a full-time study load, it can equal a full-time job.\r\n\r\nIt's important to manage your time in ways that can often prioritise your studies, amongst other things. There are things you can do to use your time wisely and keep the load moving.\r\n\r\n \tUse time management tools such as Weekly Planner to control, allocate and keep track of your time to different commitments.\r\n \tStay focused on your tasks by avoiding distractions such as screens and noise (if you need time to read and write).\r\n \tAvoid procrastination. You might think that you can work better under last-minute pressure. The reality is, it will get a lot more stressful when multiple study and work deadlines arrive at the same time. It's always better to plan and act early.\r\n\r\nLearn more about time management.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nLaTrobe University (2023) What is academic integrity?, Academic Integrity website, accessed 07 May 2023. https:\/\/latrobe.libguides.com\/academic-integrity\r\nImages by Monet (adapted), Jacob Lund and Iona on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"You're expected to learn independently at tertiary study.

These skills are valuable for a range of activities, including:\r\n\r\nLearning and development\r\nMost of your course and support materials will be available online, usually accessed through a Learning Management System (LMS) like Canvas or Blackboard. The LMS will offer course materials, readings, video content, discussions, and manage your online assessment. Being comfortable in this online environment is critical to your success in your studies.\r\nYou can use other educational websites such as simulations, learning activities, or the library website. You'll also use digital tools like videoconferencing and discussion boards to interact with your classmates and teachers.\r\n\r\nCommunication, collaboration and participation\r\nYou'll participate in a variety of networks and platforms for work together with your peers. When working in groups, you could use project management tools and shared documents. To share information and participate in discussions, you might use social media platforms like wikis and blogs.\r\n\r\nDigital creation, problem solving and innovation\r\nYou can create digital resources including websites, images and video.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation literacy\r\nThe ability to find and evaluate information for relevance in a timely manner is important. Knowing when information is reliable, credible and suitable for assessments will improve the quality of your work. Navigating online resources such as databases with effective search strategies will help to locate credible information sources. This will enable you to produce better work and achieve higher marks.\r\nMethods to develop your information literacy\r\nWhen searching the web, it's important to think critically about what you're reading. Be careful about misinformation and baseless opinions.\r\n\r\nThere are different methods for determining the quality and reliability of a resource. These include the SIFT and CRAAP methods. Consider one for your practice\u2014they both offer helpful approaches to testing the integrity of information you find online.\r\n\r\nSIFT\r\nThe SIFT (Four Moves) method is great for investigating online content. Its steps include:\r\n\r\n \tStop\r\n \tInvestigate the Source\r\n \tFind Better Coverage, and\r\n \tTrace claims, quotes and media to the original context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAAP\r\nThe CRAAP method is a checklist you can use to evaluate your source. It explains how you can determine its quality and appropriateness. The criteria includes:\r\n\r\n \tCurrency\r\n \tRelevance\r\n \tAccuracy\r\n \tAuthority\r\n \tPurpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearching your assignment\r\nInformation literacy is part of the research process. When looking for information for an assignment, applying these skills will mean that you can find more relevant and valuable information, and this can deepen your knowledge of the subject.\r\nDigital identity and wellbeing\r\nWhen you use social media, remember that your profile can be seen by many people, including future employers. The way that you interact, and the information you present online makes an impression. Be careful about how you engage with online networks, ensuring that anything you contribute is not discriminatory, defamatory or embarrassing.\r\n\r\nEnsure your privacy and security online with tactics to protect against threats like phishing1 and hacking2. Some of these include:\r\n\r\n \tStrong passwords\r\n \tTwo-factor authentication\r\n \tNot using public wifi\r\n \tUpdating device and network security\r\n \tUsing a VPN\r\n \tNot sharing personal information on email or other unsecured channels\r\n\r\nIt's also important that you manage your use of technology to prevent it from interfering with other activities or affecting your mental health. Overuse of social media, for instance, can lead to anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. Engaging with technology in a thoughtful and balanced manner can greatly reduce these harmful effects.

Learn how to design an effective poster presentation that balances text with graphics and helps your audience understand the main points of your work.\r\n\r\nWhat is a poster presentation?\r\nA poster presentation is a visual display, usually on a large poster board, that communicates the key points of a study, project, or topic. It often includes images, diagrams, flowcharts and other graphics, and bullet points are often used to highlight the main ideas. Poster presentations are common at conferences and other academic and professional events.\r\n\r\nWhile your poster might be presented to your peers with a short talk or discussion, the content and message of your poster need to be expressed clearly and concisely, in a way that is easy for your audience to understand without further explanation.\r\nPosters are a great way for you to get your message across with effective visual displays of data and small blocks of supporting text.\r\nAn effective poster is:\r\n\r\n \ta source of information\r\n \ta conversation starter\r\n \ta summary of your work\r\n \tan advertisement for your work.\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\nRead your assignment brief carefully\r\nIt is always a good idea to have a clear understanding of the assessment criteria of your assignment. This way, you will know what the person who is marking your work will be using to grade your assignment. It is recommended that you read through the assignment instructions carefully and highlight keywords and keep these in mind throughout the planning phase of your assignment. You could use the criteria as a checklist when you have finished your draft, to ensure that you have covered everything that you needed to cover.\r\n\r\nAlso, check if there are any requirements regarding the dimensions, font sizes or layout of your poster because if these requirements are not met, this could lead to a lower grade.\r\nContact the library\r\nDon\u2019t know where to look for information? Get in touch with a Librarian through the Ask the Library chat service.\r\n\r\nThey can help you find the best search terms to use, show you how to filter results, and help you identify which databases to use for your subject area.\r\nKnow your audience\r\nThink about who it is that you will present the information to. Are they professionals in your field? Are they members of the general public?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding your audience will help you to decide what content to include and the language you should use to communicate your work. Technical language and excessive jargon is not always appropriate for every assignment. Ensure that your message is clearly communicated to the target audience.\r\nWhat to include\r\nThis will depend on the purpose of your poster. For example, are you telling an audience about research that you conducted? You might decide that your audience needs to know why you conducted the research, how you did it, who participated in it, what the results were and what the implications of the results are.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you might decide to follow a typical report structure of an introduction, methods, results, conclusion and discussion sections. For another type of project, you may need to include a literature review section or recommendations. And don\u2019t forget to include your references.\r\n\r\nIf you are confused about how to structure your work, you can contact an Academic Skills Advisor through the Ask the Library service to get some feedback and advice.\r\nDesign\r\nCarefully consider the design of your poster, as this will affect how your audience engages with your information. Remember that you should include a mixture of writing and visual aids such as images, graphs, tables and charts. Your poster should be sized roughly at A0 size (841 x 1189 mm).\r\nOverall appearance\r\nYour poster should be neat and uncluttered.\r\n\r\n \tUse a pleasing arrangement of graphics, text, colours.\r\n \tOrganise sections by using white space.\r\n \tBalance the placement of text and figures.\r\n\r\nUse headings to help readers find what they\u2019re looking for: objective, results, conclusions, etc.\r\n\r\n \tMinimise text \u2013 use graphics.\r\n \tKeep text in blocks of no more than 50-75 words \u2013 don\u2019t create large, monolithic paragraphs.\r\n \tUse a columnar format.\r\n\r\nConsider text size.\r\n\r\n \tAll text should be large enough to read from 1\u20132 metres, including the text in figures.\r\n \tTitle should be larger, to attract attention from far away.\r\n \tContent should be written from top to bottom (first) and left to right.\r\n\r\nUse colour cautiously.\r\n\r\n \tDark letters on light background are easiest to read.\r\n \tStick to a theme of 2\u20133 colours.\r\n \tAvoid overly bright colours. They attract attention but wear out readers\u2019 eyes.\r\n\r\nInclude full contact information. You want to be found \u2013 the reader should not have to look up anything to find you.\r\nLayout\r\n\r\n \tConsider whether your poster would be best in landscape or portrait orientation.\r\n \tYour information should flow in a logical way, e.g., left to right, from the centre outwards, or in columns.\r\n\t[ll-image url='https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/presentations\/presentations-layout@2x.png' alt=' variety of poster layouts with columns in portrait and landscape orientation' caption=\"Poster layouts|attrib\" align=\"centre\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\n \tMake sure that your poster is not overcrowded. There should be space around each section, as this will increase the readability of your work.\r\n \tInclude a border of 3cm around your poster.\r\n\t[ll-image url='https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/presentations\/presentations-poster@2x.png' alt='Poster layout with border and box gap suggestions.' caption=\"Poster layout|attrib\" align=\"centre\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\n\r\nImages\r\nPart of your message will be conveyed through images, so they should be chosen carefully.\r\n\r\nAlways add citations, attributions and captions to images. If you are not sure how to properly cite an image or include a caption, visit Easy Cite for guidance on a variety of referencing styles.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url='https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/9b\/Corrientes-oceanicas.png' alt='ocean current world map with caption' caption=\"Figure 1: Ocean surface currents by Dr. Michael Pidwirny is in the Public Domain\" align=\"centre\"][\/ll-image]\r\nRemember, you can't include everything in your poster. Choose the most important data, graphs, and images to include. You can expand upon your poster in an accompanying presentation.\r\n\r\nAvoid overly complicated graphs, charts or tables. Rather, aim to include graphic information that is clear and easy to understand. Focus on relationships \u2013 exact values are usually less important.\r\n\r\n \tKeep the focus on data.\r\n \tGrid lines, detailed ticks on axes, data markers, and backgrounds are often not needed.\r\n \tLabel data directly, when possible. Legends force readers to look back and forth to decode the graph.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url='https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/presentations\/presentations-graphs@2x.png' alt='A good bar chart with clearly increasing values and contrasting colours, and bad graph that is a mess of overlapping lines and unclear labels' caption=\"Good and poor graphs|attrib\" align=\"centre\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\nInclude a title that stands out and catches your audience\u2019s attention. In physical settings, your title should be able to be read from 2-3 metres away.\r\n\r\nFor font sizes, it is recommended that you use:\r\n\r\n \t80-96 for titles\r\n \t30-36 for headings\r\n \t18-24 for body text\r\n\r\nOther factors to consider are:\r\n\r\n \tWhere possible, use bullet points to make your text more concise and help your reader to focus on the main ideas of your poster.\r\n \tChoose your text and background colours carefully to ensure that your work is readable.\r\n\r\n \tDon't use decorative or overly stylised fonts such as Comic Sans, as they are not considered academic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-image url='https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/presentations\/presentations-fonts@2x.png' alt='Good and bad presentations of text set in a variety of different fonts.' caption=\"Good and poor font choices|attrib\" align=\"centre\"][\/ll-image]\r\nTechnology\r\nThere are many apps and programs that can help you to design and create your poster. They include:\r\n\r\n \tMicrosoft PowerPoint\r\n \tCanva\r\n \tAdobe Illustrator\r\n \tAdobe InDesign\r\n \tMicrosoft Publisher\r\n\r\nThey each have their pros and cons, so it is recommended that you try a few and see what works best for you. Some free software and apps are available for RMIT students.\r\n\r\nOnce you have made your first successful poster presentation, especially if you receive good feedback for it, you can use it as a template for future presentations.\r\nAcademic writing\r\nIt is highly likely that your tutor or lecturer will request that you follow academic style conventions in your poster, such as avoiding personal pronouns and contractions, and using formal language. For help with academic style, you can make an appointment with an Academic Skills Advisor to review your work and get advice.\r\nPresenting your poster\r\nYou may be asked to \"walk\" people through your poster, that is, to prepare a 3\u20135 minute verbal explanation of your work.\r\n\r\nWhen giving your presentation, don't just read the poster from top to bottom. Instead:\r\n\r\n \tgive the big picture,\r\n \texplain why the problem is important, and\r\n \texplain how the graphics on your poster illustrate and support your findings and recommendations.\r\n\r\nA summary handout is something you can refer to when talking to people about your work. Prepare a handout that provides a written record for readers. You want people to remember your work. You can include:\r\n\r\n \ta miniature version of your poster\r\n \tmore detailed graphics, tables, and text explanations\r\n \tcomplete contact information.\r\n","excerpt":"Depending on your program of study, you might be asked to create a poster presentation as part of an assessment.

A successful paraphrase changes both the structure and words of the original text.\r\nIt usually isn\u2019t necessary, or desirable, to quote the exact words of another author. Instead, you can explain their work or ideas in your own words, and relate the information to the argument that you are developing. Expressing someone else\u2019s ideas in your own words is called paraphrasing.\r\nWhat is paraphrasing?\r\nThe goal of paraphrasing is to re-state information in your own words. A paraphrase is usually based on a small section of text, as opposed to a summary, which contains the main points of a larger work.\r\n\r\nA successful paraphrase keeps the original meaning of the source material, but uses different vocabulary and sentence structure to express that meaning. Paraphrasing can be a useful way of explaining complex information in simpler language. Sometimes this means that paraphrases are actually longer than the source material.\r\nHow to paraphrase successfully\r\nTo paraphrase a text, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n \tRead or listen to the text that you want to paraphrase and make sure you understand the main idea.\r\nExample of original (fictional) text\r\nAfter the cultural awareness intervention, the experimental group demonstrated growth in the target areas at a statistically significant level, while the control group showed no gains.\r\n\r\n \tWrite the idea from memory. Try switching the concepts around and start your explanation of the idea in a different place. You might imagine that you are trying to explain the idea to someone who didn\u2019t understand the original text.\r\nFirst paraphrase attempt\r\nWhile the students in the control group did not have any gains, students in the experimental group who experienced the cultural awareness intervention demonstrated significant improvements (Author 2023).\r\n\r\n \tIf you\u2019ve used too many words that are similar to the original text, replace these words with other words or phrases of similar meaning. A thesaurus or dictionary can help you, as can academic word lists that offer different word forms. A good goal is to aim for no more than 4 words in a row that are the same as in the original source.\r\nFinal paraphrase\r\nWhile the students in the control group of Author\u2019s (2023) study remained at the same levels of cultural awareness, those students who participated in the additional experimental classroom activities improved their cultural awareness by a large margin.\r\n\r\n \tCompare your language to the original text to make sure your version is different, but that you\u2019ve kept the original idea. Don\u2019t forget that you need to include a citation every time you paraphrase.\r\n\r\nAvoiding plagiarism\r\nIt is important to make sure you paraphrase correctly to avoid plagiarism. If you use a section of text from another source in your own work, and you only change a few words or move the sentences around, that is still considered plagiarism. A paraphrase needs to be significantly different in vocabulary and structure to the original text. Plagiarism-detection tools like Turnitin will flag text for plagiarism if it's too similar to another person\u2019s work, even if some of the words have been changed.\r\n\r\nNew artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, have the ability to paraphrase information, but words taken from ChatGPT also need to be properly referenced. The use of these tools is not always permitted, so be sure you understand the expectations of your course to avoid academic misconduct, and check with your instructor if you have any questions.\r\nPractice paraphrasing\r\nRead the text below, and then select the best paraphrase from the two options given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the RMIT Harvard referencing style.

It\u2019s a necessary part of developing a sophisticated argument, and is used in many forms of academic communication.\r\n \r\nUnlike summarising and paraphrasing, which only use ideas from one source at a time, synthesising combines ideas from multiple sources.\r\n\r\nSynthesising allows you to:\r\n\r\n \tdevelop and strengthen your arguments with a variety of evidence\r\n \tshow that you have read widely on the topic\r\n \tdemonstrate analytical and critical thinking skills.\r\n\r\nHow to synthesise\r\nUse the following steps to synthesise information from different sources.\r\n\r\n \tRead materials relevant to your topic, and make brief notes on the key points in each source that are connected to your argument.

Learn more about the feedback provided by Turnitin.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7lsBltqZREo\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nTurnitin is text-matching software. It\u2019s used to detect plagiarism in written assignments submitted online. It scans everything that\u2019s been uploaded for text matches. If something is copied from another source and it\u2019s not cited correctly, it will be detected. The reason RMIT uses Turnitin is to ensure academic integrity. It\u2019s important that any written work is your own or that you acknowledge that it has come from another source. Turnitin works by matching the text in assignments against electronic, print and other sources. This includes books and journals, websites, archived materials, and other students\u2019 assignments, from global universities. It detects incorrect citations and both accidental and intentional plagiarism. Turnitin makes sure that intellectual property is respected. Turnitin is constantly being updated with new entries. Assignments submitted by you and your classmates are scanned and added to the database. The similarity score is the percentage of text from your assignment that exactly matches other sources on the Turnitin database. There are five possible similarity ranges, from 0\u2013100%. The colour of the report icon represents the score. It\u2019s very unlikely that your report icon will be blue, but don\u2019t panic. The score is just an indication of matching text and will be interpreted by your teacher depending on your discipline and the assignment. In some courses you may be able to redraft, using the report to see which areas need adjusting. One way to improve your similarity score is to paraphrase. Avoid direct quotes unless they are important, for example when quoting literature, law or religious texts. Citations are critical to the success of your assessment. They validate your work and support your point of view. There are some great resources on the Learning Lab to help you practice paraphrasing and citing. For more help on using Turnitin go to their website.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you submit your work to Turnitin, a similarity report will be generated. Your instructor will review this report to help them determine whether you have referenced everything correctly, or whether you might have plagiarised. You can also use this report to check your own references and make sure you haven't accidentally plagiarised.\r\nUnderstanding the similarity report\r\nThe similarity report shows the amount of text that matches other texts, including websites, academic journals, and material previously uploaded to Turnitin. This may include work that you've submitted to RMIT in the past, as well as assignments from other institutions around the world.\r\n\r\nThe similarity report will tell you the percentage of your text that matches other materials. The match overview section highlights portions of text that match or are very similar to sources already on Turnitin. How the text matches are spread out is more important than the percentage. If you have large chunks of text which are highlighted, this could mean that more careful paraphrasing is needed. In some cases, you can make changes and upload your work again to produce a new similarity report. Check your course guide on Canvas to see if you can do this.\r\n\r\nIf there are small matches, look at these carefully. Correctly cited and formatted quotes may be highlighted, depending on the Turnitin settings. Additionally, items such as course titles, teacher names, and assignment titles may be highlighted in Turnitin.\r\nReducing the similarity score\r\nThese tips can help you reduce your similarity score:\r\n\r\n \tIf chunks of text are highlighted, then you need to paraphrase further as the wording is still too close to the original source.\r\n \tCheck that your quotations have double quotation marks. Single marks will always be ignored by Turnitin.\r\n \tCheck the settings. You can reduce the percentage immediately by excluding quotations and your reference list. Note that changing the settings does not impact what your instructor sees.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo and images on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0","excerpt":"If you are submitting written assignments for your course, your instructor will use a tool called Turnitin to make sure you haven\u2019t plagiarised in your work.

Learn what citations are and how to include them in different types of assessments.\n\nWhat is a citation?\nA citation is essentially an abbreviation with a special format. Each citation refers to a different source you are using in your work. It provides a couple of details about the source, and it points the audience to the reference list (sometimes called a bibliography) for further information.\n\nDepending on the referencing style you\u2019re using, citations can take different forms:\n\n \tParenthetical citations have information that appears between parentheses or brackets.\n \tFootnotes have two parts: a small number that appears above the text line, called a footnote number, and a note at the bottom of the page with more information.\n \tEndnotes have the same small numbers as footnotes, but the notes appear at the end of the document or section of writing.\n\nTips for inserting citations in written work\nParenthetical citations can appear at the beginning or end of a quote, paraphrase, or summary. You can also have more than one citation in a sentence if you are synthesising the ideas from multiple sources.

Learn what citations are and how to include them in different types of assessments. What is a citation? A citation is essentially an abbreviation with a special format. Each citation refers to a different source you are using in your work. It provides a couple of details about the source, and it points the audience to the reference list (sometimes called a bibliography) for further information.

With each new week there seems to be a new tool that can write text, create images, or solve other problems. But what exactly is AI, and just what can it\u2014and can it not\u2014accomplish?\r\nArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Its goal is to create computer programs or tools that can mimic human intelligence and complete tasks that generally require human skills. AI tools are helping with critical thinking and analysis tasks in many fields, such as medicine and engineering. Recently, many new tools have been released that can produce writing and create art, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and DALL-E, Google\u2019s Bard, and Adobe\u2019s Firefly.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/images\/AI-tools-image1.jpg\" portrait=\"true\" caption=\"Image generated using NightCafe from the prompt 'two students walking together on a university campus in the style of a post-impressionist painting'.

Even if using AI tools is allowed, relying on them too much could mean that you don\u2019t learn the necessary skills of your course. And if you use AI tools when it isn\u2019t permitted, that would be a breach of academic integrity.\r\n\r\nAnother important point is that many generative-text AI tools, such as the current version of ChatGPT, were not designed to provide sources. Because they are simply models of how language works, they have no concept of 'information' or where it might have come from. This means that when asked for the source of information, they will make up books and journal articles that sound real, but don't actually exist.","excerpt":"Discussions of artificial intelligence, or AI, are everywhere these days.

A number of Learning Lab pages link to Learning Lab Contextualised Content (LLCC), an open educational resource that supports learners by offering realistic and relatable examples of how key knowledge and skills may be applied. What is the Learning Lab Contextualised Content resource? LLCC is a suite of online learning materials. Content is presented in an interactive, online format, and is free for educators to use, adapt and share. It covers a range of subjects like maths, physics, writing, nursing, and sustainability literacy, as well as interpersonal, organisational, higher-order thinking, and online learning skills. The content seeks to build study and career aspirations among learners and awareness of the value of developing foundational, transferable, and multi-disciplinary skills. It does this by presenting learners with content authentic to their lives and experiences, with a focus on industries like engineering, economics and marketing, and the health and social sectors. The LLCC materials support Learning Lab pages by offering realistic scenarios showing that the skills and knowledge in the tutorials can be practically applied in scenarios learners may encounter in their everyday lives. This reinforces the value of these skills and knowledge areas in the eyes of the learner and demonstrates how developing them will be beneficial in their education and\/or careers. How can educators use this resource? The LLCC is an open educational resource (OER). The Creative Commons license is CC BY-NC which means you can use it as is or adapt it to suit your needs, providing the purpose is non-commercial (the content is not being sold) and an attribution is included. The content can be shared or downloaded in various formats. For example, learners can be linked directly to the pages online, the content can be downloaded in a PDF format, or embedded into an LMS, such as Canvas. Under your guidance and direction, students can engage with learning objects to complement the lessons they are currently undertaking or fill skills or knowledge gaps in foundation areas. The content has been designed so that learners can engage with them independently, but it can be easily adapted to suit pair or group work. There are \u2018reflect\u2019 questions in many objects, which can serve as transitions into collaborative activities and larger discussions. One of the things that makes this content special is that although it has a story, and chapters like a book, it doesn't have to be approached in a linear fashion at all. You might want to include supplementary material on communication and collaboration skills in your course, but not subject skills like maths and physics or vice versa. That is not a problem with the LLCC as the pages are modular, meaning they are self-contained, and you can use specific pages without needing to navigate the entire resource. For more information on how educators can use the LLCC resource visit the Teacher\u2019s guide.

Let's explore how it can be used to evaluate information from social media.\r\n\r\nEngaging critically with social media\r\nSocial media is one way that people learn what\u2019s happening in the world. But anyone can share just about anything online. Before you repost or retweet, how can you be sure that what you\u2019re reading isn\u2019t fake news?\r\n\r\nThoughtful social media use\r\nWhen we see or hear information that aligns with a belief we already hold, we generally don\u2019t question it. \r\nTo illustrate, if you think a certain political party is plagued by corruption, you\u2019re likely to believe a post saying one of their members was involved in a scandal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur tendency to trust information that supports what we already believe, and to ignore other facts and evidence, is called confirmation bias. Combine confirmation bias with a provocative social media post, and misinformation can spread rapidly. It\u2019s important to consider whether what you\u2019re reading and seeing is factual, especially if you\u2019re going to share it with your online community.\r\nThe SIFT method\r\nThe SIFT method is a set of four simple steps to help you determine whether something you are reading online, or anywhere, is trustworthy.\r\n\r\nSIFT stands for\r\n\r\n \tStop\r\n \tInvestigate the source\r\n \tFind better coverage\r\n \tTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context.\r\n\r\nThese steps are all about understanding the source and context of the information, so that you can decide before you even read it whether it is valid and reliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStop\r\nThis first step reminds you to pause and consider whether you know and trust the source of the information you\u2019re reading. If you have any doubts, continue with the next steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigate the source\r\n\r\nBefore you dig into an idea you find online, it\u2019s helpful to know where it\u2019s coming from. If you\u2019re not familiar with a website, look it up on Wikipedia for an overview. Knowing the expertise, perspective and agenda of the source can help you to better analyse and interpret the information provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind better coverage\r\nTo determine whether a claim is true, find more information about the topic from trusted sources. You can try to find the best, most authoritative source on a topic, or you can read multiple sources to see how different publications treat a claim you are investigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context\r\nSome people or organisations might not provide the whole picture of a topic. Quotes can be taken out of context, claims distorted, and media altered to support a particular perspective. Tracing these back to the original source allows you to see the original context and decide if the ideas have been presented accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApply your understanding\r\nRead the content shared below and consider whether the information is factual and trustworthy.

Social events are held on campus for students to hang out with classmates and get to know their peers.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity libraries as community and cultural spaces\r\nUniversity libraries are centrally located on campus where the university community can come together to meet, collaborate and build a sense of place. Libraries are often positioned near other services where you may seek information and advice, like the enrolment centre and student union.\r\n\r\nThe library is a space where people can come together to share ideas, connect with one another, exchange knowledge, and work towards common goals. It's a great place to achieve success in your studies and take advantage of the opportunities that tertiary education offers. Libraries help build community in several ways. They offer study support through drop-ins or consultations, workshops and training, as well as cultural events like exhibitions and seminars. At the same time, libraries also provide a quiet environment for students to study on their own.\r\n\r\nUniversities commonly have artistic and creative spaces such as art galleries, cinemas, and dance spaces. Some Libraries manage makerspaces, where students gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge. A makerspace is often equiped with 3D printers and laser cutters.\r\nStudy spaces\r\nThe space in which you work plays an important role in productivity as well as improving focus and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere will be times when you will need to use a designated study space on campus or at home for group work, individual study and listening to online lectures and presentations.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up a study space, it's a good idea to have all the materials you need within reach. That could be physical items like a notebook, pens, highlighters and course material like course notes, textbooks, calculator.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up a digital study space consider bookmarking study resources frequently used to improve organisation. It's also set up some folders for online documents for your courses.\r\n\r\nWhen working in a group space on campus, or at home, choose a space that will enable you and your group members to talk freely, exchange ideas and plan your work. Booking a group room on campus is one option and another is to arrange an online meeting with your group.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up an individual home study space, if possible, choose a space which allows you to control the lighting, sound, and temperature. Creating a comfortable environment with fewer distractions helps you concentrate. One of the advantages of working from home is that you can set up your study environment as you wish.\r\n\r\nImportant things for a good study space are:\r\n\r\n \ta dedicated desk\r\n \ta comfortable ergonomic chair\r\n \taccess to power\r\n \taccess to internet\r\n \tgood lighting\r\n \ttemperature \u2013 not too hot or cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nImages by Drazen and sinseeho on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"You're probably coming to campus to attend classes, but a university is much more than a collection of classrooms.

However, all educators share a common goal: to help students succeed in their studies.\r\nEducators are academics and or professionals who help students gain and practice knowledge. The types of educators that you connect with can vary depending on your level of study, i.e. vocational education (VE), higher education (HE) or postgraduate.\r\nAcademic\r\nWhen we talk about academics at a university, we could be referring to different types of educators. Some academics focus solely on research and don't do any teaching, while others do both teaching and research. An academic could be your tutor, lecturer, professor, or dean, who oversees an entire school within your college. However, academics are usually not found working in Vocational Education areas.\r\nProgram coordinators\/program managers\r\nProgram coordinators are responsible for the overall quality of a degree program or certificate program. If you have any questions about the courses you have selected for a particular year or want to swap courses or drop a course, the program coordinator would be your first point of contact to get advice.\r\n\r\nThe main responsibilities of a program coordinator include:\r\n\r\n \tdeveloping short and long-term goals for the program\r\n \tscheduling courses, teaching teams and timetabling of the program\r\n \tworking closely with course coordinators to organise off-campus programs such as internships, placements, study tours etc.\r\n \tmanaging program resources such as budgets, facilities, and types of equipment\r\n\r\nCourse coordinator\r\nCourse coordinators are responsible for designing, planning and delivering a particular course within a degree\/certificate program. They are your first point of contact if you have any queries about the course such as learning materials, timetables, assessment dates, late submission for assessments etc.\r\n\r\nSome of the responsibilities of a course coordinator are:\r\n\r\n \tworking closely with the program manager and the department head to prepare course objectives\r\n \tleading the development of the learning materials, assessments and canvas site of the particular course\r\n \tleading the course teaching team\r\n \torganising textbooks and other resources for the course\r\n \trecruitment, training and management of the tutors for the particular course\r\n \torganising guest lectures or industry expert seminars\r\n\r\nLecturer\/VE Teacher\r\nThe primary role of the lecturer is to facilitate the learning process, assess and mentor students according to the course curriculum. Lecturers are content experts in a specific discipline. Often your course coordinator and\/or program coordinator can also be one of the lecturers delivering the course. For VE educators, the primary term used is the teacher. The learning materials can be delivered in a classroom\/lecture theatre (face-to-face) or online (via Teams or Collaborate Ultra). When you have difficulties understanding course materials, you can always contact your lecturer and ask for further explanation.\r\n\r\nThe main responsibilities of a lecturer\/VE teacher include:\r\n\r\n \tdelivery of quality education and training to the students\r\n \tengaging students in the learning process\r\n \ttraining for technical skills associated with the course, such as laboratory skills, computer skills etc.\r\n \tassessment preparation and marking\r\n\r\nGuest lecturers and industry professionals\r\nMost university level courses offer lectures or seminars from guest lecturers or industry professionals, experts in their fields, as work-integrated learning. They share insights and experiences from their career as well as current knowledge in the industry or profession. An opportunity to learn from an expert in your profession is a highly valuable experience. These seminars provide an opportunity to ask questions about the industry or profession you will enter after your studies, as well as a networking platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nTutors\r\nTutors are a vital part of a course-teaching team. They usually deliver tutorial sessions, workshops and lectorials with or without a lecturer. Tutors help you understand the tutorial questions, help you with complex concepts from the course material and provide feedback on your learning. If you are hesitant to ask questions from a lecturer, tutors will be your next option. Most importantly, they are more approachable during the class\/session. Most tutors in undergraduate and postgraduate courses are current PhD students. They are friendly, welcoming you with questions and supportive, as well as experts in the subject content.\r\nLibrarians\r\nA Librarian is an information professional who supports learning, teaching and research. They provide training and support to connect the university community with the information and resources they need. They're available to support the university though various channels, including online or face to face one-on-one consultations, embedded workshops, and via online chat. Librarians are experts in information literacy, which is the ability to identify and evaluate reliable sources of information.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to ask librarians for help because they can guide you to the best resources for your assignments. They can also assist you in developing research skills that will enhance your abilities to complete a variety of assessments and tasks during your studies.\r\nAcademic skills advisors\r\nAcademic skills advisors provide valuable advice and support across a range of subject areas and academic skills. This could include writing, assignment planning and structure, English language, presentation skills and more. Some are specialists in subject areas including science, maths and chemistry. They make themselves available through a variety of ways, including workshops and online\/face to face one-on-one consultations. If you need help with your course work, it could be to check your writing or solve a mathematical equation or to further explain a science concept, academic skills advisors are there to help you.\r\nLaboratory demonstrators \/ Technicians\r\nLaboratory demonstrators play a vital role in the delivery of practical-based classes. They have a good understanding of the theory as well as laboratory skills and techniques. Laboratory demonstrators teach and assist you with laboratory skills. They are friendly and available to answer student questions during the class, provide clear explanations combining theory and the practical aspect and provide feedback on your laboratory skills and laboratory-based written work. In VE, laboratory demonstrators are called technicians.\r\nPlacement supervisors\r\nA Placement supervisor is a professional who works in a specific field and is assigned by the organization to guide, teach, and support students during their placement. They are usually willing to share knowledge, provide close guidance to develop professional practice skills and create a supportive environment to work.\r\nHDR supervisors\r\nHigher Degree by Research (HDR) students have completed a undergraduate degree and are continuing their studies through completing a postgraduate study. This may include a Masters' by research or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy).\r\n\r\nThe Higher Degree by Research (HDR) supervisory team guide, mentor, and support their students throughout the HDR candidature. The HDR supervisory team comprises a primary supervisor, co-supervisors and associate supervisors. The primary supervisor leads the supervisory team and is mainly responsible for the student's candidature. Also, they are responsible for the student's ongoing progress, arranging milestone panels, preparing the student for the milestone review, and ensuring the student has access to the required resources and the facilities to complete the study. Associate supervisors provide support with a particular area of the research. The primary supervisor is the main point of contact for students for any query.\r\nImage by Jacob Lund on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"Different types of educators work at tertiary institutions, and students may interact with them in various ways depending on their role. However, all educators share a common goal: to help students succeed in their studies. Educators are academics and or professionals who help students gain and practice knowledge.

You might have classes that meet both on campus and online, and you will likely engage with a variety of online resources.\r\n\r\nThe digital campus\r\nThe digital campus is a concept to help students and staff understand that not all learning takes place at the physical location where a tertiary institution operates. The tertiary community will have to work across the internet, online resources, digital learning environments and social platforms. The instituion where you're enrolled will aim to use these locations as well as the phsycial ones to best deliver a quality educational experience so you can develop the skills and knowledge to prepare you for work and life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlended learning\r\nMany universities have transitioned to blended learning since the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic. The blended learning experience is a mix of online and face to face activities. Blended learning is flexible, accessible, inclusive and connected, supported by specialist spaces, services and technologies. The university isn't just a physical place, and much of your learning and connections will be undertaken online.\r\n\r\nDigital learning is a core part of every student's experience. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other kinds of learning materials that you can access through digital learning platforms as you learn at your own pace. Blended learning programmes may include a rich mixture of face-to-face and\/or online learning activities incorporating different media such as text, audio or visual media. This provides opportunities to explore different learning methods and activities.\r\n\r\nA typical example of a blended learning timetable usually means that your lecturers will create in-person classes in the physical classroom and combine them with online classes. A typical blended learning schedule would be something like:\r\n\r\nMonday: In person class\r\nTuesday: In-person class\r\nWednesday: Online class and activities\r\nThursday: In-person class\r\nFriday: Live Online class and activities\r\nThe flipped classroom\r\nIn a flipped classroom, students engage with the materials before or outside of the class. It's flipped because you have done the homework before rather than after the class. This gives you the opportunity to discuss the learning material you have explored, contextualise what you have learnt, and clarify any concepts with your teacher. This allows you to develop deeper knowledge through discussion and activities (Allan, 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nConcurrent teaching\r\nConcurrent teaching is when a class is both face-to-face and online at the same time. Students who need to attend university remotely can tune into a lecture or tutorial via live video stream on their own device.\r\nSupplementary \/ other ways to learn \/ extracurriculuar opportunities\r\nAs well as the material and assessment offered by your teachers, there's plenty of other ways to get the most out of your time while you study. You may be eligible to undertake short courses, or other types of training that have no additional cost. These might help you develop skills which are valuable to employers in a workplace and give you an advantage over other graduates.\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAllan, B. (2016).

The right example or piece of evidence can help us make a convincing argument. If the examples or ideas we use come from other people, it is important that we give them appropriate credit for their work. This is called referencing.\r\n\r\nUsing other people's ideas\r\nIn the academic and professional world, referencing is the acknowledgement of other people\u2019s work and ideas.\r\n\r\nAcademic assignments often involve investigating topics and gathering ideas, data, images, and other evidence to understand and support a position. Every time you use the ideas of someone else in your own work, you need to tell the reader where the information came from.\r\n\r\nReferencing has two parts: citations, and the reference list.\r\n\r\n \tIn the body of your work, any time you want to use a direct quote from someone else, talk about their ideas more generally, or incorporate a piece of their creative work into your own, you\u2019ll include a citation. Citations offer your audience key pieces of information about the source of an idea, such as the author\u2019s surname and the year of publication.\r\n \tAt the end of your work, you\u2019ll attach a reference list. The reference list provides the complete publication information for the sources you\u2019ve cited. Every citation will refer to an entry in the reference list.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"700\"] Citations and reference list, by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0[\/caption]\r\n\r\nEach professional discipline or area of study uses a specific set of referencing rules, called style guides. These style guides explain how to format citations and create a reference list. APA, Chicago, and RMIT Harvard are the names of some popular referencing styles. You can find the rules for these styles by visiting Easy Cite.\r\nWhy is referencing important?\r\nReferencing is an integral part of academic and professional work. Accurate referencing is important for several reasons, which you can read about in detail below.\r\nReferencing strengthens your arguments\r\nBy including references, you show your audience that you have investigated prior research and existing ideas about your topic. Referencing indicates that you are developing your own arguments after consideration of other work in the field. This demonstrates professionalism, and can help your audience trust what you have to say.\r\nReferencing enables others to understand how you came to your conclusions\r\nReferences make it easy for other people to find the information you used to develop your arguments. If you include data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on income in Victoria, someone can find the same information by looking at your reference list and visiting the source for themselves. This makes it possible for others to verify your statements and understand how you arrived at the conclusions in your work.\r\nReferencing shows you are acting with academic integrity\r\nWhen you state where you found your information, you are showing respect for the work of others. This is a key aspect of academic integrity. It shows your audience what knowledge or work already existed, and what ideas are your own. All publications are the intellectual property of the authors, so taking someone\u2019s ideas without acknowledgement and representing them as your own is a form of theft and fraud, known as plagiarism.","excerpt":"We often use the ideas and work of others to support our own thinking.

Using someone\u2019s words in their original form is called quoting, or including a direct quote.\r\n\r\nWhen to quote\r\nQuoting is the way to include the exact words of others in our own work. You might want to use a quote when the specific words that an author or speaker has used are important, such as when someone offers a new definition for a term or presents a new theory.\r\n\r\nIt is important to only use direct quotes when the exact words of someone else add particular value. If you use too many quotes, you are simply reporting information that you have found, instead of offering your own analysis and evaluation of the ideas. Paraphrasing and summarising, on the other hand, show that you have really understood the ideas or issues you are investigating.\r\nHow to insert a direct quote\r\nFollow these steps to use direct quotes in your written assignments.\r\n\r\n \tCopy the exact words from the original source. (If your quote is 40 words or longer, see the section below on using a block quote).\r\n \tUse quotation marks \" \" at the beginning and end of the copied text.\r\n \tCite the quote following the citation format for your referencing style. This often means including information such as the author\u2019s surname, year of publication, and the page number where the quote appears.\r\n\r\nWritten example\r\nWhile no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, it has been defined as \"the act of needlessly delaying tasks to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort\" (Solomon &amp; Rothblum, 1984).\r\nIf you are reading a direct quote as part of an oral or multimedia presentation, you'll want to include the same citation information. You might say something like the example below.\r\nSpoken example\r\nWhile no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, Solomon and Rothblum defined the concept in their 1984 study, page 503, as \"the act of needlessly delaying tasks to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort\".\r\nUsing a block quote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlockquote, by RMIT, licensed under\u00a0CC BY-NC\u00a04.0.\r\n\r\nA block quote is a long direct quote, usually more than 30-40 words. Block quotes begin on a new line, and the entire quote is indented. Different referencing styles have different rules for exactly how to format block quotes within a larger text and where to place the citation.\r\n\r\nIf direct quotes should be used infrequently, block quotes should be used even more sparingly. Many academic papers contain no block quotes at all.\r\n\r\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the APA referencing style.

Keep reading to learn about how to use a variety of reporting verbs in your writing.\r\n\r\nReporting words\r\nReporting words are verbs that help us describe an author\u2019s position on a topic. The reporting word you choose can help your audience understand the viewpoint of the original author, or it might express your own opinion about that author\u2019s work. There are many of these reporting words in English, and they have different meanings. Some are more forceful, while others express a more modest position on a topic.\r\nExamples\r\n\"Author (2023) questions the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Author (2023) dismisses the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first example, the word 'questions' shows the audience that Author (2023) doesn\u2019t necessarily believe mining export income will increase. In contrast, the use of the word 'dismisses' in the second example shows a much stronger position. Here, Author is no longer just questioning the idea, but has completely rejected it.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right reporting word is tricky. Words have small differences in meaning, as well as in the positive, negative, or neutral feelings connected to them, also known as connotation. A dictionary can help you understand if you\u2019ve chosen the right reporting word for the idea you want to express.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWords\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggest (that)\r\nPatel et al.

Maybe you give your close friends more details when telling a story, or explain an idea more slowly and with simpler examples when talking to a child. You might even switch languages or dialects when communicating with certain people in your life.\r\nBecoming aware of the ways that we use language and structure our ideas gives us the power to be more intentional with our communication. And when we understand our audience, we can choose ways of communicating that will best convey our ideas to our listeners.\r\n\r\nRead on to learn more about audience characteristics and explore examples of information prepared for different audiences.\r\nAudience characteristics\r\nThere are several audience characteristics to consider when planning your spoken and written communication. These attributes can help you decide the type of language and vocabulary you might use, which examples you provide, the level of formality, and even whether the information is better conveyed in a spoken or written format.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Educational background\"]\r\n\r\nConsider what kind of education your audience is likely to have had. Younger people will have had less education, and therefore might need additional explanations with simpler examples and vocabulary. They might also understand better if they are given information verbally, particularly if they are beginning readers.\r\n\r\nEducation levels among adults vary, so if you are uncertain about who might be part of your audience, consider tailoring your language toward a high school level and utilising examples that rely on common knowledge.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Age\"]\r\n\r\nThe age of those in your audience will affect the examples that you use to make your point. Younger people will be less likely to recognise popular culture references from before they were born, and similarly, older members of your audience might not be connected to the youth culture of today. In spoken presentations, people of different generations might also expect different levels of formality. Tone of voice, facial expressions, and other body language will likely vary based on the age of the audience.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Cultural and language background\"]\r\n\r\nDifferent cultures have different expectations for the way information is shared. In some cultures, reading from a prepared script during a presentation is considered stilted, while in others, speaking without a written script is a sign of being unprepared. If your aim is for people to connect personally with what you are telling them, you'll also need to make sure you are using examples that are culturally relevant.\r\n\r\nThe language background of your audience, like education level, will affect your vocabulary choices. If your language or accent might be challenging for your audience, you'll want to use common, everyday vocabulary and keep your sentences short. In a spoken presentation, you can also slow down your pace for better understanding.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Prior knowledge about the subject\"]\r\n\r\nThe level of familiarity that your audience already has with your topic will have a large effect on how you present your information. Most people in your field might know certain common terms and concepts, and those won't need to be explained. If the topic of your communication will be completely new to your audience, however, you'll need to explain concepts in more detail. You might want to limit technical language, or remove it altogether, if it's not an important part of the information you're sharing.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\nExplore examples\r\nThe slides below show how the same information about climate change and the Southern Ocean might be adapted for a different audience.

We live in many systems:\r\n\r\n \tsolar system\r\n \tjustice systems\r\n \tIT systems\r\n \teconomic systems\r\n\r\nSystems thinking means considering the effects on all parts of a system rather than just one. We live on the planet earth, which is a closed system. Waste we generate stays on earth. Damaging the environment in one area can have effects on other areas.\r\nCircular economy\r\nThe circular economy uses systems thinking to create products that are meant to be recycled or reused. You can see the difference between a traditional linear economy and a circular economy in engineering, in the image below. Circular economies do not end in waste; products are reused or recycled, or even better designed with the next purpose in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage attribution: Mc4zero, CC BY-SA 4.0 on Wikimedia Commons\r\nRepair, reuse, recycle\r\nA circular economy requires that products are made in a way that does not create waste. Making products that have little or no waste is much better than relying on recycling. Products that are built to be reusable or easily repaired are the best.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples from the past when people owned their clothes, furniture, and other items for life or even longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage attribution:\u00a0by Stockwerk-Fotodesign on Adobe Stock\r\nTechnological waste\r\nTechnology produces a lot of waste, some of it is toxic. The materials used to make phones, laptops, games consoles and other technology are hard or impossible to recycle, and therefore create waste when they are created and waste at the end of their life.\r\n\r\nThere is a push for tech companies to make products that can be easily repaired rather than thrown away. Allowing people to fix their phones and replace broken parts will save a lot of money and stop a lot of waste.\r\nReusable bottles and containers\r\nIn many places, milk used to be sold in reusable glass bottles. The empty bottles were left out after use and taken back to be cleaned and refilled with fresh milk. There are some grocery stores that sell their food without any packaging today, where customers bring their own containers to fill with the products they want to buy.\r\nJars as drinking glasses\r\n\r\nFor many years, Vegemite and other products were sold in jars that were designed to be drinking glasses when empty. Jars were even printed with cartoon characters and pictures. When glass recycling became more available, the jars were not made anymore. But it is much better to reuse glass. Glass recycling uses a lot of energy \u2013 to melt the glass and reshape it \u2013 and putting jars on a truck makes air pollution. Putting Vegemite and Nutella in jars that were reused was a circular economy.\r\nRepair\r\nPeople did not always buy new things like we do today. In the past, people repaired things when they broke or reused them in a new way. There are many cities with 'repair cafes' where you can take broken items to be fixed, saving you money, and saving the environment.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many ideas from the past that we could bring back, there are also ways to create modern items that make less waste.\r\nFurther resources\r\nRMIT has a Circular Economy Hub where you can learn more about what is happening at RMIT and with industry partners.\r\n\r\nRMIT also as a Sustainable Retail Framework where you can learn more about RMIT's changes. They also have events such as repair cafes, fashion swaps and more.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about circular economy and systems, visit the Ellen Macarthur Foundation.","excerpt":"Systems thinking is a way of thinking about our products, businesses and services not just in terms of the final product or service, but also the ways that product or service impacts people and planet.

Together, these ambassadors make international decisions. They work on many topics that affect people across the world, Human rights, Peace, Waste, Weapons and much more. The UN was formed in 1945, joined by 170 member countries. that number has increased over the years to the current 193 nation-states.\r\n\r\nIts purposes and principles are to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations based on equal rights and self-determination, and to achieve international co-operation in solving economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian challenges without distinction for race, sex, language, or religion.\r\nFrom the United Nations Charter\r\n\r\nInitially, there were eight United Nations sustainable development goals, called the Millenium Development Goals, which started in 2000 and finished in 2015. The Millenium Development Goals were redeveloped into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs have a timelilne for completion by 2030.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators. Providing the details of targets and indicators helps people measure the progress of each goal.

The rationale for the formation of this program was to avoid duplication of activities. The UNDP links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the goals and national development priorities laid out by host countries. It focuses primarily on five developmental challenges:\r\n\r\n \tDemocratic governance\r\n \tPoverty reduction\r\n \tCrisis prevention and recovery\r\n \tEnvironment and energy\r\n \tHIV\/AIDS\r\n\r\n1992 \u2013 Rio Earth Summit\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the 'Earth Summit', was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3-14 June 1992. It brought together political leaders, diplomats, scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from 179 countries to focus on the impact of human activities on the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Rio de Janeiro conference highlighted how different social, economic and environmental factors are interdependent and evolve together, and how success in one sector requires action in other sectors to be sustained over time (systems thinking). The primary objective of the Rio 'Earth Summit' was to produce an agenda and a structure for international action on environmental and development issues that would help guide international cooperation and development policy in the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nThe Earth Summit had many great achievements including the\u00a0Rio Declaration\u00a0and its 27 universal principles, the\u00a0United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the\u00a0Convention on Biological Diversity,\u00a0the\u00a0Declaration on the principles of forest management,\u00a0and it led to the creation of the\u00a0Commission on Sustainable Development.\r\n2000 \u2013 Millennium Development Goals\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were eight international development goals for the year 2015, established after the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000 and following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. These were based on the OECD DAC International Development Goals agreed by Development Ministers in the \"Shaping the 21st Century Strategy\". The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) succeeded the MDGs in 2016.\r\n\r\nAll 191 United Nations member states, and at least 22 international organizations, committed to help achieve the following Millennium Development Goals by 2015:\r\n\r\n1. To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger\r\n2. To achieve universal primary education\r\n3. To promote gender equality and empower women\r\n4. To reduce child mortality\r\n5. To improve maternal health\r\n6. To combat HIV\/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases\r\n7. To ensure environmental sustainability\r\n8. To develop a global partnership for development\r\n2005 \u2013 the 2005 World Summit outcome document is written\r\nThe 2005 World Summit, held between 14 and 16 September 2005, was a follow-up summit meeting to the United Nations' 2000 Millennium Summit, which had led to the Millennium Declaration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\n\r\nRepresentatives (including nearly 200 leaders) of the then 191 member states met in New York City for what the United Nations described as \"a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take bold decisions in the areas of development, security, human rights and reform of the United Nations\".\r\nThe summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security.\r\n2012 \u2013 The move from MDGs to SDGs is launched\r\nThe Rio+20 conference (the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development) in Rio de Janeiro, June 2012, began the development of a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which continue the momentum generated by the MDGs and fit into a global development framework beyond 2015.\r\nThe MDGs were revolutionary in providing a common language to reach global agreement. The 8 goals were realistic and easy to communicate, with a clear measurement\/monitoring mechanism.\r\n\r\nSubstantial progress was made on the MDGs. The world had achieved the first MDG of halving the extreme poverty rate by 2015. However, the achievements were uneven across different parts of the world. The MDGs expired in 2015 and the focus is now \u201con building a sustainable world where environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic development are equally valued.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2028https:\/\/www.sdgfund.org\/mdgs-sdgs\r\n2013 - The 30-member\u00a0UN General Assembly\u00a0Open Working Group (OWG) on Sustainable Development Goals is established\r\nIn January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group (OWG) on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The OWG submitted their proposal of 8 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.\u00a0On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the Secretary General's Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.\r\n2015 \u2013 Deadline for the Millennium Development Goals\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals generated the most successful anti-poverty movement in history. The commitment entered into by world leaders in the year 2000 was translated into a framework of eight goals and, then, into practical steps that improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against\r\nhunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect the planet.\r\nDespite all these improvements, inequalities persist and progress was uneven: the world\u2019s poor are still concentrated in some parts of the world; many women continue to die during pregnancy or in childbirth, women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged\r\nbecause of their age, disability or ethnicity still face many challenges, conflicts still remain the biggest threat to human development, and climate change and environmental degradation undermine any progress achieved.\r\nHowever improvements were made in these areas:\r\n\r\n \tReduction of extreme poverty rate in developing countries\r\n \tReductio in the number of extreme poor globally\r\n \tMore primary school-age children receiving education\r\n \t90% of countries have more women in parliament\r\n \tReduction in global numbers of childhood deaths\r\n \tGreater global measles vaccination coverage\r\n \tReduction in global maternal mortality rates\r\n \tReduction in HIV infections and more antiretroviral therapy treatment available globally\r\n \tBetter access to drinking water\r\n \t98% reduction in ozone-depleting substances\r\n\r\n2015 - The Sustainable Development Goals are decided and set\r\nThe SDGs, also known as Global Goals, build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and aim to go further to end all forms of poverty. The new Goals call for action by all countries, poor, rich and middle-income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must coincide with strategies that build economic growth and addresses a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection.\r\n\r\nWhile the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals. Countries have the primary responsibility for follow-up and review of the progress made in implementing the Goals, which will require quality, accessible and timely data collection. Regional follow-up and review will be based on national-level analyses and contribute to follow-up and review at the global level.\r\n2018 - The establishment of the United Nations Alliance for Sustainable Fashion.\r\nMade up of several United Nations organisations, the Alliance for Sustainable Fashion was established to help promote sustainability in fashion. The Alliance also advocates for the achievement of the UN\u2019s 17 SDGs within a fashion context. Its objectives include promoting active collaboration, sharing knowledge, strengthening the relationship and collaboration between existing initiatives, and achieving outreach and advocacy to promote a sustainable fashion industry.\r\n2019 - World leaders\u00a0at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a\u00a0Decade of Action\r\nWorld leaders at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a\u00a0Decade of Action\u00a0and delivery for sustainable development, and pledged to mobilize financing, enhance national implementation and strengthen institutions to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2030, leaving no one behind.\r\n\r\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all 17 SDGs has shown that what began as a health crisis has quickly become a human and socio-economic crisis. While the crisis is imperiling progress towards the SDGs, it also makes their achievement all the more urgent and necessary. It is essential that recent gains are protected as much as possible. A transformative recovery from COVID- 19 should be pursued, one that addresses the crisis, reduces risks from future potential crises and relaunched the implementation efforts to deliver the 2030 Agenda and SDGs during the Decade of Action.\"\r\n\r\n\u2028https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/decade-of-action\/\r\n2030 - The 17 Sustainable Development Goals target date for completion\r\nThe United Nations\u00a0Sustainable Development Goals\u00a0(SDGs) are targets for global development adopted in September 2015, set to be achieved by 2030. All countries of the world have agreed to work towards achieving these goals.\r\n\r\nThe UN SDG Tracker presents data across all available indicators from the\u00a0Our World in Data\u00a0database, using official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. It is a free, open-access publication that tracks global progress towards the SDGs and allows people around the world to hold their governments accountable to achieving the agreed goals.\r\n\r\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals are defined in a list of 169 SDG Targets.

Litter left on the ground is washed into stormwater drains and from there into Port Phillip Bay. Rubbish and litter has a negative effect on the environment, the creatures living in the bay, birds and more. By tracking litter, the program can educate people about the importance of disposing of waste properly.\r\n\r\nFind out more about The Litter Trackers: Reducing Littering by Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage attributon: from RMIT's Acquatic Pollution Prevention project\r\nAquatic Pollution Prevention Partnership\r\nRMIT is not just working on educating people about litter in Port Phillip Bay, it is also preventing it from reaching the water.\r\n\r\nIn this partnership with Melbourne Water, RMIT is working on solutions to prevent litter and other waste from reaching Port Phillip Bay and other Victorian waterways.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the Aquatic Pollution prevention Partnership\r\n\r\nThese examples show that sustainability projects often address more than one SDG.

The video will introduce you to the concept and the formula.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the inverse square law.\r\n\r\nIn maths it relates to gravity, electricity, the intensity of sound, light and other types of radiation.\r\n\r\nLet's look at an example.\r\n\r\nRita runs a deli where she spends a lot of time buttering bread for sandwiches. She needed a way to do this more efficiently, so she bought a butter gun. It was great.\r\n\r\nRita could spray a single serve of butter with a pull of a trigger, but it was still a lot of work. After a few attempts Rita noticed the pattern.\r\n\r\nRita could spray a set amount of butter onto one slice at a certain distance. At twice the distance she could butter four slices with a thickness of one quarter of the original amount.\r\n\r\nAt three times the distance she could butter nine slices with a thickness of one ninth the original amount.\r\n\r\nLet's explain this pattern mathematically. If 'i' is equal to the number of serves of butter per slice, when we're looking at a distance of one 'd' away from the butter gun, the 'i' equals one serve per slice. When we're looking at twice the distance we're looking at 'i' equals one quarter.\r\n\r\nOne quarter is the same as two one on two squared.\r\n\r\nIf we're looking at three times the distance we're looking at 'i' equals one ninth. Which equals one on three squared.\r\n\r\nNow when you're having a look at this, let's have a look at a pattern. If I also included this in the pattern we can see that intensity is directly proportional to one on 'd' squared.\r\n\r\nThis translates to the thickness of the butter is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the butter gun.\r\n\r\nThis is called the inverse Square law and is a universally recognised rule\u00a0[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nQuestions\r\nUse simple division and the information from the video to solve the following equations.\r\nSound\r\nThe intensity of sound is measured in Watts per square metre - \\( W\/m^{2}\\)\r\n\r\nThe sound intensity of a loud siren at \\(5m\\), is \\(36 \\times 10^{-2} W\/m^{2}\\)\r\n\r\nWhat is the sound intensity at:\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"10 metres\"]\\(9 \\times 10^{-2} W\/m^{2}\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"15 metres \"]\\(4 \\times 10^{-2} W\/m^{2}\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"20 metres \"]\\(2.25 \\times 10^{-2} W\/m^{2}\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"2.5 metres \"]\\(144 \\times 10^{-2} W\/m^{2}\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nLight\r\nThe intensity of light is measured in 'candela' - \\( cp\\)\r\n\r\nA bright spotlight has a light intensity of 120.0 candela at a distance 2.00 m.\r\n\r\nAt what distance is the intensity at:\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"30 candela\"]\\(4m\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"13.3 candela \"]\\(6m\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"1.2 candela \"]\\(1m\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"2.5 candela \"]\\(0.5m\\) [\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nGravity\r\nThe intensity of gravity is measured in 'g', relative to the force applied on the earth by a mass.

Knowledge about this structure will help you read it efficiently.\r\nMethodology: Describes the methods used to carry out the research.\r\nResults: This section describes the findings. (Sometimes the results and discussion sections are combined.)\r\nDiscussion: Contains an interpretation of what the results mean in terms of the original research question or hypothesis, and in the field.\r\nConclusion: This is a discussion of the meaning and implications of the research. It may also detail the implications of the research and make recommendations for changes to policy and practice directions or directions for further research.\r\nReferences: A list of the literature on which the research was based.\r\n\r\nReading strategies for academic articles\r\nThe principles of active reading can be applied to academic articles.\r\nThink about why you are reading the article. \r\nKey texts\r\nIf the article is a key text that you need to understand thoroughly, then you might start by surveying the text- reading the article title, finding out about the author, looking at the heading titles and checking out an visual elements such as graphs and charts. \r\nWhile you read, remember to think critically. Just because you are reading an academic article, does  not mean that you must agree with everything theory or idea expressed in it. Consider whether the information is credible, whether the research has been carried out in an effective way and if the conclusions drawn from the research are logical.\r\nSearching for specific information\r\nThis is where skimming and scanning will come in handy. \r\nBefore you start reading, decide what information you are looking for- list down any key words, terms or numerical data that you would like to search for.\r\nNext, review read quickly through the articles content, stopping when you find a key word or anything that you feel may be relevant. Then, read the text surrounding the key word or information carefully while taking notes.\r\nSearching for general information\r\nWhen searching for general information, many students start by reading the title of the article and the abstract. From this, they are often able to tell if the article will contain information that is useful to them. \r\nIf it doesn't, then they can move on to the next article without having lost time reading something that is not relevant. \r\nIf they believe the article does contain relevant information for their assignment, then they move on to reading the introduction for more information on the purpose of the article, followed by the discussion and\/or conclusion sections. These sections will provide an interpretation of the results and summarise the main points.","excerpt":"Reading academic articles can be tricky and time consuming.

There are many areas of manufacture in the fashion and textile industry where changes can be made to make this industry more sustainable.\r\n\r\nTextile recycling \u2013 the textiles (fabric and other materials used to make clothing) can be broken down and the fibres (threads that make up the fabric) can be recycled into new clothes.\r\n\r\nRepair \u2013 creating garments that are easy to repair ensures that they can last longer.\r\n\r\nWages \u2013 garment workers (people who make clothes) are paid a living wage.\r\n\r\nReuse \u2013 high quality, well made clothes can be resold many times. Cheap, badly made clothes cannot.\r\nWhat is fast fashion?\r\nFast fashion is growing around the world. Fast fashion are clothes made very cheaply and quickly that are only worn a few times before being thrown away.\r\n\r\nPeople today own far more clothes than they used to in the past, and some of these clothes are cheap and not made to last. The actual cost of the clothes is much higher than the price people are paying to buy them if we think about the cost of waste produced.\r\n\r\nSome experts have suggested that by making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of dealing with clothing waste, we might stop people from buying so many cheap clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage attribution: Halfpoint on Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nThe rise of Internet shopping, propelled further by the recent pandemic, has made it very easy to buy new clothes. Many of these clothes are very cheap. No one needs to buy new clothes every week or every month. Making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of waste is one way to change fast fashion.\r\n\r\nThere are companies recycling textiles that break down the clothes and create new threads and materials. There are many drop-off points in Australia that will accept old clothes for recycling. Buying recycled clothing can help to make the fashion industry more sustainable. If you are choosing new clothes, look for recycled fabrics and support companies that recycle, or are 'fair trade' and pay their workers a fair price for their labour.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit the RMIT Library subject guide on Sustainable fashion and textiles.\r\n\r\n[nav-panel title=\"Talking about fast fashion and sustainability\" link=\"https:\/\/rmit.pressbooks.pub\/llcc\/chapter\/talking-about-fast-fashion-and-sustainability\/\" icon=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/design-system\/images\/icon-llcc-large.svg\"]Explore this topic further in a real world context[\/nav-panel]","excerpt":"The clothing industry is global, extremely large and prolific because we all need clothes to wear.

It also considers where the materials are made. Some countries will have different rules that can impact how much waste a company generates making materials.\r\n\r\nThe Higg Index developers applied five principles to understand how sustainable different fabrics are:\r\n\r\n \tclimate impact (how much heat this will add to the world's climate)\r\n \twater pollution (how much and what kind of pollution will go into waterways while making this fabric?)\r\n \twater use (some fabrics use a lot more water than others in production)\r\n \tuse of fossil fuels (this includes products made of fossil fuels and ones that use fossil fuels for transport or when they are made)\r\n \tchemistry (what is the fabric made of? How will those chemicals breakdown and react after they are not wanted any more?)\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the impact of different fabrics gives designers and companies a way to make more sustainable clothing. The Higg index has expanded since it was first developed. Now, companies can look at their impact from \"cradle-to-grave\" or from the raw materials they use to the waste after the product has finished. This lifecycle view looks at transportation, office spaces, suppliers, materials and much more to help companies find ways to be more sustainable.\r\n\r\nNote: the Higg Index has been criticised for scoring fabric from fossil fuels too highly (nylon and other plastic based fabrics) and rating them more highly than natural fibres (leather, silk and others).

In this module we introduce fractional indices and give some meaning to numbers and expressions like \\(3^{1\/3}\\)or \\(x^{1\/2}\\).\r\n\r\nIndex laws\r\nRemember the basic index laws:\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{m}\\div a^{n}=a^{m-n}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{mn}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{0}=1\\)\r\n \t\\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{-n}=\\frac{1}{a^{n}}\\)\r\n\r\nThese hold when \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are whole numbers or fractions.

But the square root of \\(3\\) is the number that when multiplied by itself gives \\(3.\\) That is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3} &amp; =3. \\end{align*}\\] Since \\(3^{1\/2}\\) behaves like \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) we say \\[ 3^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{3}. \\]\r\n\r\nConsider now \\(2^{1\/3}\\). Using the first index law, we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{1\/3}\\times2^{1\/3}\\times2^{1\/3} &amp; =2^{1\/3+1\/3+1\/3}\\\\ &amp; =2^{1}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(2^{1\/3}\\) behave like the cube root of \\(2.\\) That is, \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{1\/3} &amp; =\\sqrt[3]{2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general we say that \\(a^{1\/n}\\) is the \\(n^{th}\\) root of \\(a.\\) That is \\[ a^{1\/n}=\\sqrt[n]{a} \\] for any positive integer \\(n\\) (whole numbers like \\(1,2,\\ldots\\) ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\qquad4^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{4}=2.\\)\r\n \t\\(\\qquad27^{1\/3}=\\sqrt[3]{27}=3.\\)\r\n \t\\(\\qquad3^{1\/4}=\\sqrt[4]{3}.\\)\r\n \t\\(\\qquad b^{1\/5}=\\sqrt[5]{b}.\\)\r\n \t\\(\\qquad x^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{x}.\\)\r\n \t\\(\\qquad32^{-1\/5}=\\frac{1}{32^{1\/5}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[5]{32}}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\)\r\n\r\nIn most cases the root of a number will not be able to be written as a whole number or fraction and will be an irrational number.

This reflects the product rule in differentiation and is applicable to logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and algebraic functions.\r\nIntegration by parts is a technique for integrating the product of two functions. For example: \\[ \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx \\] where the functions are \\(x\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) or \\[ \\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx \\] where the functions are \\(x^{3}\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\). This module gives some information on using this technique.\r\n\r\nFormula\r\nThe integration by parts formula is obtained from the product rule for differentiation. For any two differentiable functions \\(v\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)\\) we have, by the product rule, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right) &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrating both sides with respect to \\(x\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}\\right)dx,\\;\\textrm{that is,}\\\\ v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx+\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] This can be rearranged to give the formula for integration by parts: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)-\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] Which is often abbreviated to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe hope is that by choosing the functions \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) carefully, the integral on the right hand side is easier than the original integral. Successful use of integration by parts requires a correct choice for \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\). If the integral on the right is harder, then try swapping \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\).\r\n\r\nTo assist you in choosing \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) choose \\(v\\) to be the function that comes first in the sequence of functions:\r\n\r\n \tlogarithmic function\r\n \tinverse trig function\r\n \talgebraic function\r\n \ttrigonometric function\r\n \texponential function\r\n\r\n\\(u'\\) is then the other function in the integrand. 1 The integrand is the function that is being integrated. For example the integrand in \\[ \\int x\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx \\] is \\(x\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). In this case it is the product of an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) so we would set \\(v=x\\), (because algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions), and \\(u'=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nExample 1: Find \\(\\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nHere we have an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Since algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions, we let \\(v=x\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\\) and \\(u=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). Using the formula we have: 2 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] and the fact that \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\).  \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\left(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\cdot1dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)+\\cos\\left(x\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant.} \\end{align*}\\] Note that if we chose the functions as \\(v=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u'=x\\), then \\(v'=-\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}.\\) Substituting in the formula will give: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right is harder than the one we began with and we make no progress. If this happens to you, change the selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find \\(\\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nHere we have an algebraic function \\(x^{3}\\) and a logarithmic function \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\). Since logarithmic functions are higher on the list than algebraic functions, we let \\(v=\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=x^{3}\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\/x\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\). Using the formula we have 3 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\right)-\\int\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\int x^{3}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}+c\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)}{4}-\\frac{x^{4}}{16}+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3: Find \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nWe apparently have only one function \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\). The trick here is to note that the integrand 4 The integrand is the function that is integrated. In this case it is \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) which is the same as \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\). can always be multiplied by \\(1\\) without change. So instead of seeing \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx.\\) We see \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1dx.\\) We can view \\(1\\) as the constant value function.5 The constant value function \\(1\\) is just a function that gives the value \\(1\\) regardless of its argument. That is \\(1\\left(x\\right)=1\\) for all \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) The constant value function is algebraic, \\(\\left(1=x^{0}\\right)\\) and below an inverse trigonometric function like \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) on the list above. So we set \\(v=\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=1,\\) then \\(dv\/dx=1\/\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and \\(u=x.\\) Substituting in the formula we get:6 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx. &amp; (1) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side can be evaluated with the substitution \\(w=1-x^{2}\\) then \\(dw\/dx=-2x\\) and \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\), using the substitution rule7 The substitution rule states \\[ \\int f\\left(g\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\frac{dg}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(w\\right)dw \\] where \\(w=g\\left(x\\right)\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx &amp; =\\int-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w}}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\int w^{-1\/2}dw\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2\\right)w^{1\/2}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)^{1\/2}+c\\\\ &amp; =-\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this result in equation (1) we get the final result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx.\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeated use of integration by parts\r\nSome integrals require the use of the integration by parts technique more than once. For example, consider \\(\\int x^{2}e^{x}dx\\). We have an algebraic function \\(x^{2}\\) multiplying an exponential function \\(e^{x}.\\) According to our guide we set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2x\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula we get: 8 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx. &amp; (2) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side requires another integration by parts. We set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=2x\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx &amp; =2xe^{x}-\\int2e^{x}dx\\\\ &amp; =2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}. &amp; (3) \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute this result in equation (2) to get the result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\left(2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c\\right)\\;\\textrm{using ($3$ )}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-2xe^{x}+2e^{x}-c\\\\ &amp; =e^{x}\\left(x^{2}-2x+2\\right)-c. \\end{align*}\\] Note that it doesn\u2019t matter if we put \\(c\\) or \\(-c\\) as \\(c\\) is just any constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} \\textrm{1.

Integrating using partial fractions helps you to solve this problem.

The idea is that each partial fraction is an easier integral than the original. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int &amp; \\frac{1}{x^{2}+5x+6}dx=\\int\\frac{1}{x+2}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x+3}dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integrals on the right are much simpler than that on the left. This module explains how this can be done.\r\n\r\nAdding fractions\r\nWhen adding fractions we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator and then add the numerators.1 The numerator is the top line of the fraction and the denominator is the bottom line.

Since \\(x^{2}+2x-3=\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\), we are dealing with the case where the denominator has two distinct linear factors. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] Now we have to determine the constants \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\) First add the partial fractions. We do this by finding a common denominator, in this case \\(\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right):\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1} &amp; =\\frac{A}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x-1\\right)}{\\left(x-1\\right)}+\\frac{B}{\\left(x-1\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A\\left(x-1\\right)+B\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax-A+Bx+3B}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax+Bx-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(A+B\\right)x-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3} \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{\\overbrace{\\left(A+B\\right)}^{x-\\textrm{coefficient}}x\\overbrace{-A+3B}^{\\textrm{constant term}}}{x^{2}+2x-3}. \\end{align*}\\] The constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be found by equating the coefficients of terms on the left and right sides of the equation. On the left, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\) and on the right the coefficient is \\(A+B\\) . Similarly the constant term on the left side is \\(-5\\) and on the right it is \\(-A+3B\\). This gives us the following simultaneous equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -A+3B &amp; =-5 &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These equations are easily solved by elimination. Adding the equations we get \\[\\begin{align*} 4B &amp; =-4\\\\ B &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting for \\(B\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} A-1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Finally we have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}+\\frac{-1}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] We can now evaluate the integral \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{2}{x+3}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x-1}dx\\\\ &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ,c\\textrm{ being a constant. } \\end{align*}\\] Using the laws of logarithms, \\(a\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\ln\\left(x^{a}\\right)\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(a\\right)-\\ln\\left(b\\right)=\\ln\\frac{a}{b}\\) , we can also write the answer as: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ c\\textrm{ being a constant. }\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}}{\\left|x-1\\right|}+c \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find the integral of \\(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\)\r\nWe first factorize the denominator: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5 &amp; =x^{2}\\left(x-5\\right)+x-5\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right). \\end{align*}\\] In this case we have a quadratic factor and a linear factor. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x+5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(Ax+B\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}+\\frac{C\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax^{2}-5Ax+Bx-5B+Cx^{2}+C}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x+5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(A+C\\right)x^{2}+\\left(-5A+B\\right)x-5B+C \\end{align*}\\] Equating coefficients of \\(x^{2}\\), \\(x\\) and the constant gives the three equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+C &amp; =1 &amp; &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -5A+B &amp; =-3 &amp; &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ -5B+C &amp; =16. &amp; &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] which may be solved simultaneously as follows. Multiply \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(5\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 5A+5C &amp; =5 &amp; &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and add equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} B+5C &amp; =-3+5\\\\ &amp; =2\\\\ 5B+25C &amp; =10\\;\\textrm{\\;multiplying by $5$ .} &amp; &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding equation \\(\\left(5\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} 26C &amp; =26\\\\ C &amp; =1. &amp; &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) into \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} A+1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =0. &amp; &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Finally substituting \\(A=0\\) in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =-3. &amp; &amp; \\left(8\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Therefore the partial fraction decomposition is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x-5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can now do the integral: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}\\right)dx\\;\\;\\textrm{using partial fractions}\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{x-5}dx-3\\int\\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left|x-5\\right|-3\\tan^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+c,\\ \\ \\;c\\textrm{ being a constant.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant note\r\nThe process of finding partial fractions can only be performed on fractions where the degree of the denominator of the algebraic fraction is greater than that of the numerator. If necessary, divide the denominator into the numerator then express the remaining fractional part as partial fractions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the numerator and denominator of \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} \\end{align*}\\] are of degree \\(2\\). So before finding partial fractions we would divide the numerator by the denominator to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} &amp; =1+\\frac{4x+5}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The fraction at right can then be changed into partial fractions to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} &amp; =1+\\frac{1}{x+1}+\\frac{3}{x+2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tRewrite each of the following in the appropriate generalized partial fractions form.

You can simplify this by substituting a single pronumeral (say u) to represent one of the functions. The substitution rule for integration is like the chain rule for differentiation: it breaks a complex expression into manageable parts.\r\nUnder some circumstances, it is possible to use the substitution method to carry out an integration. The idea is to make a substitution that makes the original integral easier. Generally, if some part of the integrand is a derivative of another part multiplied by a constant, substitution may be useful. 1 The integrand of an integral is the function being integrated. For example the integrand of the integral \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] is \\(2x\\cos x^{2}\\).\r\n\r\nIntegration by substitution\r\nThe basic rule is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \\(u=g\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(\\frac{du}{dx}=g'\\left(x\\right)\\) then \\[ \\int f\\left(g\\left(x\\right)\\right)g'\\left(x\\right)dx=\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\]\r\n\r\nThis may also be written: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple test may be used to see if substitution is useful. Look at the integrand2 The integrand of an integral is the function being integrated. For example the integrand of the integral \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] is \\(2x\\cos x^{2}\\). and see if one part of it is the derivative of another part multiplied by a constant. If so, substitution may be helpful. For example consider \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx. \\] Note that the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\) and so one part is the derivative of another part and substitution can be used. Even if we have the integral \\[ \\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\). Since \\(x\\) is 1\/2 of the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\), substitution is still possible.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Calculate \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx\\)\r\nSolution: In this solution we use the second form of the substitution rule.3 \\[ \\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\]\r\n\r\nLet \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)=\\cos\\left(u\\right)=f\\left(u\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=2x\\). Substituting these in the integral gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{du}{dx}\\cos\\left(u\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)du\\quad\\textrm{using the substitution rule}\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\cos\\left(u\\right)du\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(u\\right)+c+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x^{2}\\right)+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that our choice of \\(u=x^{2}\\) was based on the fact that the derivative is \\(2x\\) which is part of the integrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Calculate \\(\\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx\\)\r\nSolution: Again set \\(u=x^{2}\\) because \\(du\/dx=2x\\) and so \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\).

These steps are not required and were put in to clarify the use of the substitution rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5: Find \\(\\int x^{2}e^{4-x^{3}}dx\\)\r\nSolution: We set \\(u=4-x^{3}\\) because \\(du\/dx=-3x^{2}\\) which is \\(-3\\) times the other part of the integrand. So \\(x^{2}=-\\frac{1}{3}du\/dx.\\)Substituting, the integral is:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{4-x^{3}}dx &amp; =\\int\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}e^{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}\\int e^{u}\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}\\int e^{u}du\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}e^{u}+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}e^{4-x^{3}}+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 6: Find \\(\\int\\frac{x^{4}}{1+x^{5}}dx\\)\r\nSolution: Let \\(u=1+x^{5}\\) then \\(du\/dx=5x^{4}\\) and \\(x^{4}=\\frac{1}{5}du\/dx\\). Substituting in the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x^{4}}{1+x^{5}}dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{5}du\/dx\\frac{1}{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\int du\/dx\\frac{1}{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\int\\frac{1}{u}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\ln\\left|u\\right|+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\ln\\left|1+x^{5}\\right|+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinite integrals\r\nThe method of substitution may also be used to evaluate definite integrals but you need to be careful with the limits of integration when you change the variable of integration.\r\n\r\nFor example suppose we want to evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx\\). We set \\(u=2x+1\\)5 We will use the fact that \\[ \\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}=1\\times\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}. \\] then \\(du\/dx=2\\)and so \\(1=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\). Note that when \\(x=0,\\) \\(u=1\\) and when \\(x=1,\\) \\(u=3.\\) Substituting into the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}1.\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}.u^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{1}^{3}u^{5}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{6}\\left[u^{6}\\right]_{u=1}^{u=3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(3^{6}-1^{6}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(729-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{728}{12}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{182}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the change of limits on the integration in line 3 as we are now integrating with respect to \\(u.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative notation\r\nIn many texts and possibly your lecture notes, you will find a slight change in notation. For example, consider the integral of Example 1 above: \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx.\\) As before we set \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(du\/dx=2x\\). The alternative notation then rearranges this to give \\(dx=\\frac{1}{2x}du\\).

Read this worksheet to see how to deal with finding the integral for sections of graph which go above and below the x-axis (horizontal axis).\r\nThis module deals with the problem of finding the area between a curve and the x-axis.\r\n\r\nDetermining the area under a curve\r\nFor a curve defined by \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) the definite integral \\[ \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx \\] gives a signed measure of the area bordered by the lines \\(x=a\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=0\\) and the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\).1 Note that the line \\(y=0\\) is the \\(x\\)-axis.\r\n\r\nIf \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\geq0\\) between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\) you would get a positive value for the definite integral as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\leq0\\) between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\) you would get a negative value for the definite integral as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the area under a curve is always given as a positive number. The area is the absolute value of the signed areas: \\[ \\textrm{Area }=\\left|\\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx\\right|. \\] In the general case where \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) crosses the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the value of the definite integral may be positive or negative. However the area under the curve is always taken as the sum of the modulus of the signed areas. For example, the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\) is plotted below. The graph cuts the \\(x\\)-axis at -1, 0 and 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the value of the definite integral from \\(x=-1\\) to \\(x=2\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{-1}^{2}\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\right)dx &amp; =\\left[\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x^{2}\\right]_{x=-1}^{x=2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}2^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}2^{3}-2^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\left(-1\\right)^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-1\\right)^{3}-\\left(-1\\right)^{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4-\\frac{8}{3}-4-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-2.25. \\end{align*}\\] But this is not the area. To calculate the area we need to evaluate two integrals. One from -1 to 0 (this is represented by the blue part of the graph) the other from 0 to 2 that represents the negative signed area. The actual area would then be the sum of the absolute value of these integrals.

To do this we determine where the graph of the function cuts the x-axis. This gives us the limits of integration for the definite integral. Factorizing the function we see: \\[\\begin{align*} 4x-x^{2} &amp; =x\\left(4-x\\right). \\end{align*}\\] When the graph of the function cuts the x-axis, \\(x\\left(4-x\\right)=0\\) and so \\(x=0\\) or \\(x=4\\). That is the x-axis intercepts of the function are at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=4\\). At this point we need to graph the function as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see the function is above the \\(x\\)-axis and so the area will be positive.2 Since the area is positive, we do not need the absolute value sign. The area is \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\int_{0}^{4}f\\left(x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{4}\\left(4x-x^{2}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\frac{4x^{2}}{2}-\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\right]_{x=0}^{x=4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4\\left(4\\right)^{2}}{2}-\\frac{\\left(4\\right)^{3}}{3}-\\left(\\frac{4\\left(0\\right)^{2}}{2}-\\frac{\\left(0\\right)^{3}}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{64}{2}-\\frac{64}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(64)-2(64)}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{64}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{32}{3}\\textrm{ square units}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nGiven the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1\\) find the area bounded by the curve, the \\(x\\)-axis and the lines \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\).\r\n\r\nAs in the previous example we need to sketch the graph of the function and then consider the range of integration. Factorizing the function 3 We use \\(a^{2}-b^{2}=\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right).\\) This is an identity you should remember. \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-1 &amp; =\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x-1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] So the x- axis intercepts where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1=0\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\). At this point we need to graph the function as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see the signed area will be negative as \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is below the axis between the points of integration. So we must use the modulus of the definite integral: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Area} &amp; =\\left|\\int_{-1}^{1}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)dx\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x\\right]_{x=-1}^{x=1}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{3}-1-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-1\\right)^{3}-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{3}-1-\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}+1\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{2}{3}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\frac{4}{3}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{3}\\;\\textrm{square units}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nGiven the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1\\) find the area bounded by the curve, the \\(x\\)-axis and the lines \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\).

Such integrals are called indefinite integrals or antiderivatives. They do not have a specific value.\r\n\r\nFor a function \\(f(x)\\) suppose we can write an antiderivative \\(F(x)=\\int f(x)dx\\). We then define a definite integral of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) with respect to \\(x\\) using the notation:7 This is known as the first fundamental theorem of calculus. \\[ \\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}=F(b)-F(a) \\] where we assume \\(f(x)\\) is defined for all \\(x\\) in the interval \\([a,b]\\). We call \\(a\\) the lower limit of integration and \\(b\\) the upper limit of integration. The notation \\(\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}\\) means substitute \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\) into \\(F(x)\\) and then subtract the values.

It is easier to see with specific numbers as in the following examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(1\\)\r\nFind the inverse of the matrix \\({\\bf A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\).\r\nSolution\r\nSet up the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf A}|{\\bf I}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We now use row operations to reduce the matrix on the left hand side (LHS) to the identity matrix .\r\n\r\nReturning to our problem, we already have a \\(1\\) in the \\(a_{11}\\) position of the LHS matrix so we first make \\(a_{21}=a_{31}=0\\) as follows\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}+R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ R_{3}-R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(2\\) of figure \\(1\\) above.\r\n\r\nNow we want \\(a_{22}=1\\) in the LHS matrix. There are two ways to do this. We could divide \\(R_{2}\\) by \\(2\\) however this introduces a fraction that may be awkward (fractions are commonly required but we delay their use until necessary). The other way, which we will use, is to interchange \\(R_{2}\\) and \\(R_{3}\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3}\\\\ R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(3\\) figure \\(1\\) above and partially completes Step 4. Next we make \\(a_{32}=0\\) in the LHS matrix by subtracting \\(2R_{2}\\) from \\(R_{3}.\\) As a bonus this gives \\(a_{33}=1\\) in the LHS matrix:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}-2R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Steps \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. Finally we make \\(a_{13}=a_{23}=0\\) using \\(R_{3}\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{1}\\\\ R_{2}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(6\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. The LHS matrix is the identity matrix and so the RHS is the inverse. That is \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] You should always check that \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)1 Since in general, for matrices \\({\\bf A}\\)and \\({\\bf B},\\) \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf B} &amp; \\neq{\\bf B}{\\bf A} \\end{align*}\\] it is important to check both \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf I}\\) and \\({\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)  We have \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1} &amp;

This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nDivide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\)\r\n\r\nFirst we set up the long division by writing\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nNow we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down.\r\n\r\nDivide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero.\r\n\r\nDivide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) 4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. In other words \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing a higher order polynomial\r\nThe basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nDivide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFirst we write the long division as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down.\r\n\r\nDivide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\). That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(x^{3}\\) to get \\(x^{2}\\) and write\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) and write as below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}\\)and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2\\phantom{bbbi+11x)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(11x\\) term and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nDivide\r\n\r\nWe now repeat the algorithm. We divide the highest power of \\(x-1\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\). That is, we divide \\(x\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x\\) and write as follows.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,\\,-5x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(-5x\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) from \\(-5x^{2}+11x\\) to get \\(6x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ - \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x \\phantom{)-6} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(-6\\) and write as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nDivide the leading term of \\(x-1\\) into the leading term of \\(6x-6.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(6x\\) to get \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-1\\) by \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(6x-6-\\left(6x-6\\right)\\) to get \\(0\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nAs there are no more terms to bring down, we stop the algorithm. Our result is that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6=\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best interpretation as we can then factorise the quadratic term on the RHS to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Which is of value when we are trying to graph \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\) as it gives us the \\(x-\\)intercepts of the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nDivide \\(\\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe major difference from example 2 above is that there is no \\(x^{2}\\) term in \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1. \\end{align*}\\] We get around this by writing \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =2x^{3}+0x^{2}-3x+1 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThat is, we set up the long division as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nand apply the algorithm used in Example 1 and 2 above.\r\n\r\nApplying the algorithm we obtain:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nHence we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =2x^{2}+2x-1 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\times\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn your work, the final result as shown above is all that is required.

However the Factor Theorem is equally important.\r\n\r\nThe Factor Theorem states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \\(P(x)\\) is a polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(P(a)=0\\) then \\((x-a)\\) is a factor of \\(P(x)\\). We can use the factor theorem to find one factor of a polynomial, and then use polynomial long division to find the remaining factor(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the equation \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0.\\)\r\n\r\nWe first use the Factor Theorem to try and get a linear factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24.\\) Let \\[ P\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 \\] then letting \\(x=1,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(1\\right) &amp; =1-5-2+24\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=-1\\) to get, \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1-5+2+24\\\\ &amp; =20\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)=\\left(x+1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(2\\right) &amp; =8-20-4+24\\\\ &amp; =8\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-2\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=-2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =-8-20+4+24\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-2\\right)\\right)=x+2\\) is factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\). We now use polynomial division to divide \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\) by \\(x+2.\\) We have\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2-7x+12\\phantom{)} \\\\ x+2{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-5x^2-2x+24\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3+ 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- 7x^2 \\,-2x\\phantom{bbbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-7x^2-\\!14x)}\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ 12x+24 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(12x+24)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThat is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\right)\\div\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\\\ x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\left(x+2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The quadratic on the RHS may be factorised as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-7x+12 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n5 This can be done by inspection, or more formally using the quadratic formula which says for a quadratic equation: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0,\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] In our case \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-\\left(-7\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{49-4\\left(1\\right)12}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{1}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =4\\text{ or $3$ .} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nand so \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solutions to \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0\\), are \\(x=4\\), \\(x=3\\) and \\(x=-2.\\)\r\n\r\nPlease try Exercise 2 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\n\\(\\quad\\)a.

The manipulation is multiplication of one or both equations by a constant. Then we add or subtract the equations to eliminate a variable.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\).\r\nSolution\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x+y &amp; =6\\quad\\left(1\\right)\\quad\\text{(number the equations)}\\\\ x-y &amp; =2\\quad\\left(2\\right)\\quad\\text{(note the $y$ coefficients are equal and opposite)}\\\\ 2x &amp; =8\\quad\\left(1\\right)+\\left(2\\right)\\quad\\text{(add equations to eliminate $y$ )}\\\\ x &amp; =4.\\\\ \\textrm{Substitute $x=4$ } &amp; \\textrm{back into equation $\\left(1\\right)$ or $\\left(2\\right)$ to solve for }y\\\\ 4+y &amp; =6\\quad\\text{(using $\\left(1\\right))$ }\\\\ y &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe solution is (\\(4,2\\)).\r\n\r\nWe can check the solution by substituting in the original equations.

We will eliminate \\(x\\) and so multiply equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(4\\) (coefficient of \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\)) and multiply equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) by \\(3\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right))\\) to get:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+8y &amp; =40\\quad\\left(3\\right)\\\\ 12x+9y &amp; =39\\quad\\left(4\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n1 To eliminate \\(y\\) we would multiply equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(3\\) (coefficient of \\(y\\) in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\)) and multiply equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) by \\(2\\) (the coefficient of \\(y\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right))\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} 9x+6y &amp; =30\\quad\\left(3\\right)\\\\ 8x+6y &amp; =26\\quad\\left(4\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then subtracting \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(x=4\\) into either equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\(y\\).\r\n\r\nNow \\(x\\) may be eliminated by subtracting equation \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(4\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n2 We could also subtract equation \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} -y &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The answer is the same and the order of subtraction doesn\u2019t matter.\r\nNow substitute this into either equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right)\\). It doesn\u2019t matter which one you use though sometimes one choice is a little easier.

This variable is then substituted into the second equation to get an equation in one variable which may be solved. Once one variable is known, we can solve for the other variable.\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\).\r\nSolution\r\nFirst number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} x+y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ x-y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nRearrange \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to make \\(x\\) the subject: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6-y. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n3 Note that you can also make \\(y\\) the subject and proceed in the same way.

We use equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} x+2 &amp; =6\\\\ x &amp; =4 \\end{align*}\\] and the solution is \\(x=4\\text{ and }y=2\\) or \\(\\left(4,2\\right).\\) This may be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(3x+2y=10\\) and \\(4x+3y=13\\).\r\nSolution\r\nFirst number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2y &amp; =10 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 4x+3y &amp; =13. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can make either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) the subject using equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right).\\) We will make \\(y\\) the subject. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =10-3x\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{10-3x}{2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSubstitute in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 4x+3\\left(\\frac{10-3x}{2}\\right) &amp; =13\\\\ 8x+3\\left(10-3x\\right) &amp; =26\\\\ 8x-9x &amp; =26-30\\\\ -x &amp; =-4\\\\ x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute for \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\times4+2y &amp; =10\\\\ 2y &amp; =-2\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=4,\\ y=-1\\) or \\(\\left(4,-1\\right).\\) This can be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphical method\r\nIn the graphical method the straight line graph representing each equation is plotted on the same set of axes. The solution is the point of intersection of the two lines. The graphs must be plotted accurately for this method to give an accurate answer. For this reason it is not usually used unless specifically asked for.\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\) graphically.\r\nSolution\r\nGraphs representing each linear equation are drawn and the point of intersection is read from the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution is (\\(4,2\\)).\r\n\r\nCheck by substituting in each equation: \\(4+2=6\\) and \\(4-2=2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquations without solutions\r\nSome pairs of equations do not have a solution. Graphically this means that the two lines do not intersect.\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(2x-y=6\\) and \\(-4x+2y=-7\\).\r\nSolution\r\nNumber the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x-y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -4x+2y &amp; =-7. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] You can use any of the three methods above to try and solve the equations. We will use substitution. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x-6. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting into equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -4x+2\\left(2x-6\\right) &amp; =-7\\\\ -4x+4x-12 &amp; =-7\\\\ -12 &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The last line is impossible and so we conclude no solution exists.\r\n\r\nWe show the graphs of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) below. The two lines are parallel and never intersect, so no solution exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple solutions\r\nSome pairs of simultaneous equations have multiple solutions. In this case, the equations have the same graph. That is one line lies on the other line.\r\n\r\nExample 7\r\nSolve \\(y=1-3x\\) and \\(6x=2(1-y)\\).\r\nSolution\r\nRearrange the equations so that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are on the same sides and number the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+y &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 6x+2y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that these two lines are the same because \\(\\left(2\\right)=2\\times\\left(1\\right).\\) Consequently they have the same graph and there are multiple values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy them. For example, setting \\(x=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(y=1\\) so \\(\\left(0,1\\right)\\) is a solution. Setting \\(y=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(x=1\/3\\) and so \\(\\left(1\/3,0\\right)\\) is also a solution. In fact there are an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line \\(3x+y=1.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nSolve simultaneously using either the elimination or substitution method:\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ y=x-3\\text{ and $5x-2y=18.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(2.\\ y=3x+4\\text{ and $2x+3y=23.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(3.\\ 4x+y=23\\ \\text{and $x-y=2.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(4.\\ -3x+2y=-4\\ \\text{and $5x-2y=8$ .}\\)\r\n\r\n\\(5.\\ 3x-5y=14\\ \\text{and $2x+y=5.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(6.\\ 3x+2y=18\\ \\text{and $2x-5y=-7$ .}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ \\left(4,1\\right)\\quad\\quad2.\\ \\left(1,7\\right)\\qquad3.\\ \\left(5,3\\right)\\qquad4.\\ \\left(2,1\\right)\\qquad5.\\ \\left(3,-1\\right)\\qquad6.\\ \\left(4,3\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nSolve the following simultaneous equations graphically.\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ y=x-3\\ \\text{and $x+y=5.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(2.\\ 5x-y=8\\ \\text{and $2y-3x=-2.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(3.\\ x+y=1\\ \\text{and $y-2x=7.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ \\left(4,1\\right)\\qquad2.\\ \\left(2,2\\right)\\qquad3.\\ \\left(-2,3\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, ES2 Simultaneous Equations (PDF 247 KB) \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Two equations in two variables are said to be simultaneous if both must be considered at the same time.

A simple example is the graph of the line \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =x. \\end{align*}\\] It has the graph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =x+2 \\end{align*}\\] is shown in red below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just the graph of \\(y=x\\) shifted \\(2\\) units upward and is an example of a transformation involving vertical translation.\r\n\r\nThis module discusses how to transform the graphs of known functions to more complex functions using simple rules that are called transformations. In particular, we will consider the following transformations:\r\n\r\n \tReflection\r\n \tTranslation\r\n \tDilation\r\n \tCombinations of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic graphs\r\nWhen attempting to graph a function, the following items need to be considered:\r\n\r\n \t\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts\r\n \tturning points\r\n \tbehavior as \\(x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\)\r\n \tasymptotes. It is very useful to know the graphs of some simple functions. You can then transform them to more complex functions using the contents of this module. Below are some basic graphs that you should know.1 While it is best that you know these graphs, if you cannot recall them, you can still determine their graphs by plotting some points.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x\\)\r\nThis is a straight line with slope or gradient of \\(1.\\) It passes through the origin and is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x^{2}\\)\r\nThis is a parabola with vertex at the origin as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x^{3}\\)\r\nThe essential feature is that the graph goes through the origin increases for positive \\(x\\) and decreases for negative \\(x.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=1\/x\\)\r\nThis is a graph with asymptotes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x-\\) axis) as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=a^{x}\\)\r\nThe basic graph is as shown below for \\(a=1.6\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important thing to note is that the \\(y-\\) intercept is at \\(1\\) and doesn\u2019t depend on the value of \\(a\\) because \\(a^{0}=1.\\) Also the function cannot be less than zero so the negative \\(x-\\)axis is an asymptote. Changing the value of \\(a\\) will change the values on the \\(y-\\)axis but the basic shape of the graph is the same. In practice, the most common value of \\(a\\) is \\(e\\) and is most likely to come up in your course. So the graph above gives the basic shape of \\(y=e^{x}\\) but the \\(y-\\) axis values are incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=\\log x\\)\r\nThe graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important characteristic is that the graph cuts the \\(x-\\) axis at \\(1\\) because \\(\\log\\left(1\\right)=0.\\) Note that this graph is similar for \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\log_{e}\\left(x\\right)\\) or any other log base .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformations\r\nAs mentioned above, transformations may be used to modify basic graphs. The transformations are\r\n\r\n \tReflection\r\n \tTranslation\r\n \tDilation\r\n \tCombinations of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReflection\r\nAs the name suggests, a reflection is a mirror image of a graph. Reflection may be about any line but generally involves the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axes.\r\n\r\nFor a graph \\(y=f\\left(x\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =f\\left(-x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] reflects the graph about the \\(y-\\)axis while\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} y= &amp; -f\\left(x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] reflects the graph about the \\(x-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nExample \\(1\\): Reflection of \\(y=a^{x}\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes\r\nReferring to the graphs shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph is \\(y=a^{x}\\) and is shown in blue.\r\n\r\nReflection about the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=a^{-x}\\) and is shown in red.\r\n\r\nReflection about the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-a^{x}\\) and is shown in green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(2\\): Reflection of \\(y=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes\r\nOriginal graph is \\(y=x^{2}\\) and is shown in blue below\r\n\r\nReflection about the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=\\left(-x\\right)^{2}=x^{2}.\\) This means the reflection in the \\(y-\\)axis of the original graph doesn\u2019t change anything. This is due to symmetry of the original graph about the \\(y-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nReflection about the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-x^{2}\\) and is shown below in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(3\\): Reflection of \\(y=2x+1\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes\r\nOriginal graph is \\(y=2x+1\\) and is shown in blue below.\r\n\r\nReflection in the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=2\\left(-x\\right)+1=-2x+1\\) and is shown in green.\r\n\r\nReflection in the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-\\left(2x+1\\right)=-2x-1\\) and is shown in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslation\r\nTranslation involves moving a graph, in the \\(x-y\\) plane, horizontally or vertically.\r\n\r\nHorizontal\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(x-a\\right)\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units to the right.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(x+a\\right)\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVertical\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)+b\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d units up.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)-b\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d units down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(4\\): Translation of \\(y=\\log\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(1\\) unit to the right\r\nOriginal graph is \\(y=\\log\\left(x\\right)\\) and is shown in blue below. The translated graph is \\(y=\\log\\left(x-1\\right)\\) and is shown in red below. It is the graph of the original function shifted \\(1\\) unit to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the negative \\(y-\\)axis forms an asymptote for the original graph. The translated graph has an asymptote of \\(x=1\\) and is shown as a dotted line. The new asymptote should be shown on the graph of the transformed function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(5\\): Translation of \\(y=1\/x\\) three units to the left\r\nThe original graph is of \\(y=1\/x\\) and is shown in blue below. The translated graph is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\frac{1}{x+3} \\end{align*}\\] and is the graph of the original function shifted \\(3\\) units to the left. It is shown in red below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original graph had the \\(y-\\)axis as its asymptote. The transformed graph has an asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) which is shown as a dotted line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(6\\): Translation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right),\\) \\(\\pi\/2\\) units to the left\r\nThe original graph is of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=\\sin\\left(x+\\pi\/2\\right)\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting example as the translation converts the sine function to the cosine function.2 To see this, recall the trigonometry identity \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\left(a+b\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(a\\right)\\cos\\left(b\\right)+\\cos\\left(a\\right)\\sin\\left(b\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now let \\(a=x\\) and \\(b=\\pi\/2.\\) Substituting in the above identity we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\left(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\cdot0+\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\cdot1\\\\ &amp; =\\cos\\left(x\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(7\\): Translation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) two units vertically up\r\nThe original graph is of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)+2\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the translation simply moves the graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) up \\(2\\) units. Nothing else changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(8\\): Translation of \\(y=x^{2}\\) two units vertically down\r\nThe original graph is of \\(y=x^{2}\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=x^{2}-2\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the translation simply moves the graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) down \\(2\\) units. Nothing else changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDilations\r\nDilations stretch or compress a graph of a function. The stretching or compression can occur in the directions of either the \\(x\\) or the \\(y\\) axes, or both.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=af\\left(x\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. If \\(a&gt;1\\) the graph is stretched or elongated. If \\(a&lt;1,\\)the graph is compressed or squashed.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(bx\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(1\/b\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis. If \\(b&gt;1\\) the graph is compressed or squashed. If \\(b&lt;1,\\)the graph is stretched or elongated.\r\n\r\nExample \\(9\\): Dilation of \\(y=x^{2}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis by a factor of \\(4\\) and 1\/3\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) is shown in blue.\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=4x^{2}\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis.\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\frac{1}{3}x^{2}\\)is shown in green and shows that the original graph is squashed parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(10\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(2\\)\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\)\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(2x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is squashed by a factor of \\(2\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(\\pi\\) which is half that of the original graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(11\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(1\/2\\)\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\)\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(0.5x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(4\\pi\\) which is twice that of the original graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCombinations of transformations\r\nMore complicated graphs may be obtained from a basic graph by combining reflection, translation and dilation. In such cases you start with the basic graph and do the dilation first (if there is one). After this step, do translations and reflections in any order.\r\n\r\nExample \\(12\\): Graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\)\r\nThe basic graph is \\(y=x^{3}.\\) We want to transform this to \\(y=2x^{3}+4.\\) This involves two transformations \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{\\ 2\\ }_{\\text{Transformation1 }}x^{3}+\\underbrace{\\ 4\\ }_{\\text{Transformation 2}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) is a dilation of 2 parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. It is a stretching of the original graph parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(2\\) is a translation of \\(4\\) units upward.\r\n\r\nThe basic graph to be transformed is \\(y=x^{3}\\) and is shown in blue below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first do the dilation on this basic graph. That is we graph \\(y=2x^{3}\\). This is shown as the dashed blue graph below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally we do the translation of \\(4\\) units upwards to get the desired graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\). This is shown in red below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do is identify where the graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\) intersects the \\(x-\\)axis. To do this we set \\(y=0\\) and solve for \\(x.\\) That is \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}+4 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x^{3} &amp; =-4\\\\ x^{3} &amp; =-2\\\\ x &amp; =-1.26. \\end{align*}\\] This information can be added to get the following figure:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur final answer is the red graph shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(13\\): Graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\)\r\nThe basic graph in this case is \\(y=x^{2}.\\) There are three transformations involved: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{-}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}\\underbrace{\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}}_{\\text{Tranformation 2 }}\\underbrace{-1}_{\\text{Transformation 3}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) is a reflection about the \\(x-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(2\\) is shift of \\(y=x^{2}\\) to the left by \\(2\\)units.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(3\\) is a shift of \\(1\\) unit downwards.\r\n\r\nAs there is no dilation, we are free to make the transforms on the basic graph in any order. In this example we will go from transformation \\(1\\) to \\(3\\) but the order does not matter.\r\n\r\nThe figure below shows the basic graph \\(y=x^{2}\\) in blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) reflects this in the \\(x-\\)axis. This is the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\) and is shown in dashed blue below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation 2 shifts the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\), \\(2\\) units to the left. This is the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x-2\\right)^{2}\\) and is shown in orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(3\\) shifts the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}\\) down one unit. This is the desired graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) and is shown below in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intercept of the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) appears to at \\(\\left(0,-5)\\right)\\). This can be checked by setting \\(x=0:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(0+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-5. \\end{align*}\\] The final graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) is shown below in red. We have marked the \\(y-\\)intercept at \\(\\left(0,-5\\right)\\) and the vertex at \\(\\left(-2,1\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(14\\): Graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\)\r\nThe basic graph is of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) .\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) involves two transformations: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\sqrt{\\underbrace{\\,-x}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}}+\\underbrace{\\,2}_{\\text{Transformation 2}}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation 1 is a reflection of the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) in the \\(y-\\)axis and is the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\).\r\n\r\nTransformation 2 is a translation of \\(2\\)units vertically up and gives the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}+2\\).\r\n\r\nThe graphs of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\), and \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) are shown below in blue, dashed blue and red, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nSketch the following graphs\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{1. }y=\\frac{2}{x+1}\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{2. }y=\\log\\left(x+3\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{3. }y=x^{2}-25\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{4. }y=2-\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{5. }y=4^{x}\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{6. }y=2e^{x}+1\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"The known graphs of some simple functions and relations can be used to sketch related, but more complicated functions.

In this module, you'll learn about what functions and relations are and you can practice with the provided exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations\r\nA relation is a set of ordered pairs. For example \\((1,2),(2,6),(3,4),(x,y)\\) are ordered pairs and \\(\\left\\{ (1,2),(2,6),(3,4),(x,y)\\right\\}\\)is a relation.\r\n\r\nThe domain of a relation is the set of first elements or the \\(x\\)-values of the ordered pairs.\r\n\r\nFor the above ordered pairs the domain, dom = \\(\\left\\{ 1,2,3,x\\right\\}\\).\r\n\r\nThe range of a relation is the set of second elements or the \\(y\\)-values of the ordered pairs. For the above ordered pairs the range, ran = \\(\\left\\{ 2,4,6,y\\right\\}\\).\r\n\r\nThere is often a rule that links the domain and range.\r\n\r\nFor example: 1 The symbol \\(\\in\\) means \u201cis in\u201d or \u201cis an element of\u201d , the symbol \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) stands for the set of real numbers. The expression \\[\\begin{align*} x\\in &amp; \\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\] means that \u201cx is an element of the set of real numbers\u201d. That is, \\(x\\) is a real number. \\[ S=\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y&gt;x,\\,x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\right\\} \\]\r\n\r\nThis relation, called S, consists of the set of all ordered pairs (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)), where the \\(y\\) value is greater than the \\(x\\) value and where \\(x\\) must be a real number.\r\n\r\nNote that a relation is defined by its rule (in this case \\(y&gt;x\\)) and its domain (in this case \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\)).2 If the domain is not given then we assume the largest possible domain.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nSketch the graph of the following relation and state the domain and range:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=x^{2}\\right\\} . \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this example the rule joining the set of ordered pairs (\\(x,y\\)) is \\(y=x^{2}\\).\r\n\r\n\\(x\\) can be any real number.

Each point in the domain of a function has a unique value in the range. Every value of \\(x\\) may have only one value of \\(y\\) .\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tThe relation \\(\\left\\{ (-1,2),(-1,4),(1,6),(2,8),(3,10)\\right\\}\\) is not a function because the value \\(x=-1\\) has two corresponding \\(y\\) values \\((2\\textrm{ and}\\) \\(4)\\).\r\n \tThe relation \\(\\left\\{ (-1,1),(0,2),(1,3),(2,5),(3,7)\\right\\}\\) is a function because for each \\(x\\) value there is only one corresponding \\(y\\) value.\r\n \t\\(F=\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=\\sin x,x\\in R\\right\\}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we choose any possible value of \\(x,\\) there exists only one corresponding value of \\(y\\). Therefore, the relation \\(F\\) is a function.\r\n\r\nAnother way of writing this function is with mapping notation.\r\n\r\n\\[ f:X\\rightarrow Y,\\textrm{where $f(x)=\\sin x.$ } \\]\r\n\r\n(The domain, \\(X\\), is mapped onto the range, \\(Y\\), using the rule \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) )\r\n\r\nIf only the rule is given then we assume that the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVertical line test\r\nWhen relations are represented graphically, a vertical line test may be applied to decide if they are functions.\r\n\r\nIf a vertical line crosses the graph more than once, then it is not a function, as an \\(x\\) value has more than one \\(y\\) value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph on the left is not a function (the vertical line crosses the graph more than once), the graph on the right is a function (vertical line only crosses the graph once). 4 See Exercise 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImplied domain\r\nIf only the rule of the function is given, then we assume that the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (the set of real numbers) unless otherwise defined implicitly by the function.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tIf a function involves a square root, the domain, in the real number system, is restricted to those values of \\(x\\) that result in a non-negative number under the square root sign.\r\nSo, the domain of the function \\(y=+\\sqrt{x-4}\\) is restricted such that \\(x-4\\geq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\geq4\\right\\}\\).\r\n \tThe domain of the function \\(y=+\\sqrt{9-x^{2}}\\) is restricted such that \\(9-x^{2}\\geq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:-3\\leq x\\leq3\\right\\}\\).\r\n \tIf the function involves a fraction, the value in the denominator must not equal zero.\r\nSo, the domain of the function \\(y=\\dfrac{3}{x+5}\\) is restricted such that \\(x+5\\neq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\neq-5\\right\\}\\).5 The domain may be written as \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x:x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\left\\{ -5\\right\\} \\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\] Here \\(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\left\\{ -5\\right\\}\\) is the set of real numbers excluding \\(-5\\).\r\n \tThe domain of the function \\(y=\\dfrac{3}{2x-8}\\) is restricted such that 2\\(x-8\\neq0\\) ;

Mastering this skill is crucial for scientific research, engineering, everyday tasks, and effective communication across different measurement systems. Let's find out more.\r\n\r\nIf you expressed a quantity without a unit, it would not provide much information. For instance, you say to a friend that you have gained \\(3kg\\) during the past three months. If you say just three without kilograms, it won't make sense to your friend as three can be in any units we use to measure mass, such as grams, miligrams, kilograms, pounds, etc. Therefore, adding a unit next to a quantity is essential to get the correct information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA physical quantity can be measured in several units. For instance, weight can be expressed in kilograms, grams, pounds, etc. Therefore, scientists have introduced standard units for each physical quantity to avoid confusion. This system is known as the international system of units (SI Units).\r\n\r\nSome SI units and symbols\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantity\r\nUnit\r\nSymbol\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMass\r\nKilogram\r\n\\(kg\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength\r\nMetre\r\n\\(m\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume\r\nCubic metre\r\n\\(m^{3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperature\r\nKelvin\r\n\\(K\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nTime\r\nSecond\r\n\\(s\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nElectric current\r\nAmpere\r\n\\(A\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmount of substance\r\nMole\r\n\\(mol\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nLuminous intensity\r\nCandela\r\n\\(cd\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA common issue associated with any measuring system is that depending on the quantity, the unit we use might be inconvenient to express. For instance, expressing the diameter of a bacterial cell \\(\\left(0.0000001m\\right)\\) in metres is challenging. Therefore, prefixes have been introduced to express such measurements. The multiples and fractions of SI units are expressed with prefixes.\r\n\r\nCommon SI and matrix unit prefixes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefix\r\nSymbol\r\nMultiplied by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiga\r\nG\r\n\\(10^{9}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmega\r\nM\r\n\\(10^{6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nkilo\r\n\\(k\\)\r\n\\(10^{3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\ndeci\r\n\\(d\\)\r\n\\(10^{-1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\ncenti\r\n\\(c\\)\r\n\\(10^{-2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmilli\r\n\\(m\\)\r\n\\(10^{-3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmicro\r\n\\(\\mu\\)\r\n\\(10^{-6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nnano\r\n\\(n\\)\r\n\\(10^{-9}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\npico\r\n\\(p\\)\r\n\\(10^{-12}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit Conversions\r\nWe can use conversion factors to convert one unit to another. For instance, conversion of miligrams to grams. From prefixes we know\u00a0\\[ 1000mg=1g \\]\r\n\r\nBoth \\(1000mg\\) and \\(1g\\) refer to the same amount, but in different units. Based on this relationship we can create pair of conversion factors \\[ \\frac{1000mg}{1g}\\:\\:\\textrm{and}\\:\\:\\frac{1g}{1000mg} \\]\r\n\r\nExpress \\(150.0mg\\) in grams? We can calculate \\(150mg\\) in grams using the conversion factor \\(\\frac{1g}{1000mg}\\) as follows \\[ \\frac{1g}{1000mg}\\times150.0mg=0.1500g \\]\r\n\r\nExpress \\(0.275g\\) in milligrams?

How can you tell the strength of a base? The information on this page will provide the answers to these questions.\r\n\\[\\require{mhchem}\\]\r\nStrong acids and weak acids\r\nAcids can be categorised as strong acids or weak acids, depending on their ability to completely transfer protons in an aqueous solution. Strong acids can transfer nearly all (100%) of their protons (hydrogen ions) to the water. Weak acids can only transfer some of their protons to the water.\r\n\r\nThe extent of electron transfer depends on the molecular structure of acids. If the hydrogen is bound to a highly electronegative1 atom like oxygen or chlorine, that hydrogen is acidic and is able to undergo complete ionisation. For instance, hydrochloric acid (\\(\\ce{HCl}\\)). If hydrogen is bound to a less electronegative atom like carbon, the bond is not polar enough to release hydrogen. For instance, hydrogen bound to carbon in acetic acid (\\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\)). Acetic acid has four hydrogens: one bound to oxygen and the other three to carbon. Only the hydrogen bound to oxygen is released as acidic hydrogen, making acetic acid a weak acid. \\[\\begin{align*} \\ce{HCl}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right) &amp; \\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\left(aq\\right)\\\\ \\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right) &amp; \\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COO}^{-}\\left(aq\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the acids are weak acids.

For a weak acid, equilibrium lies more to the left side. Therefore, in a solution of a strong acid, dominant species are \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\), while that in a weak acid is \\(\\ce{HA}\\).\r\n\r\nStrong Bases and Weak Bases\r\nStrong bases show a high affinity for protons in an aqueous solution. For instance, \\(\\ce{NaOH}\\), \\(\\ce{KOH}\\) and hydroxides of main group one and two elements in the periodic table.\r\n\r\nWeak bases show less affinity for protons in aqueous solutions. For instance, the solution of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) gas in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a solution of a strong base, the equilibrium lies more towards the right side. Therefore the dominant species in the solution are \\(\\ce{BH}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{OH}^{-}\\). In a solution of a weak base, the equilibrium lies more towards the left, which means the dominant species in the solution is \\(\\ce{B}\\).\r\n\r\nThere is an inverse relationship between the strength of an acid and the strength of a base. The conjugate base of a strong acid is always a weak base, and the conjugate base of a weak acid is always a strong base. This relationship can be explained using the definition of a strong\/weak acid and strong\/weak base. The strong acid has the capacity to completely (nearly 100%) dissociate in water to donate protons, which means its conjugate base has less affinity to protons as the reaction equilibrium favours towards the right side (forward reaction predominates). A base showing less affinity for protons is a weak base. Similarly, in water, the weak acid partially dissociates to produce protons, which means its conjugate base displays a high affinity for the protons, as reaction equilibrium lies towards the left (reverse reaction predominates). Therefore, the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base, and the weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcids and Bases Ionisation Constants\r\nThe strengths of acids and bases can be quantified using ionisation constants.\r\n\r\nDissociation of a weak acid in water can be written as: \\[ \\ce{HA}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right)\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{A}^{-}\\left(aq\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nIonisation constant is a form of the equilibrium constant. Therefore, the ionisation constant of the above reaction can be written as follows: \\[ K_{a}=\\frac{\\left[\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\right]\\left[\\ce{A}^{-}\\right]}{\\left[\\ce{HA}\\right]} \\]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\\(K_{a}\\)= acid ionisation\/dissociation constant\r\n\r\nWater is not included in the ionisation constant expression as water is a pure liquid. The concentrations of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\)and \\(\\ce{HA}\\) are experimentally determined to calculate the ionisation constant. We can predict the strength of an acid using the acid ionisation constant. The strength of an acid is directly proportional to the acid ionisation constant. Strong acids have large \\(K_{a}\\)values (\\(&gt;1\\)) as a forward reaction is favoured, leading to a larger concentration of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) than \\(\\ce{HA}\\). Weak acids possess \\(K_{a}\\) values less than \\(1\\), as ionisation (forward reaction) is not favoured.\r\n\r\n1Electronegativity (EN) is the power in an atom in a molecule to attract electrons.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What is the difference between a strong and a weak acid?

Such fractions are common in mathematics and engineering.\r\nMore complicated algebraic fractions can involve polynomials of any order.\r\n\r\nHowever in your studies, it is unlikely that you will have to deal with polynomials higher than quadratics. 1 A quadratic is a a polynomial of degree 2 and has the general form: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx &amp; +c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(a,b,c\\) are constants.\r\n\r\nIn this module, we consider algebraic fractions involving quadratics.\r\n\r\nThere is no general theory for this so we proceed via examples. Please note that algebraic fraction may exclude certain values of \\(x.\\) This is to ensure we never get a zero denominator. 2 The numerator is the top expression in the fraction. For \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b} \\end{align*}\\] \\(a\\) is the numerator. The bottom expression is called the denominator. Here \\(b\\) is the denominator.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a common denominator is fundamental to algebraic fractions.3 Before you can add or subtract two fractions you need to have a common denominator. For example, to determine \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{2} \\end{align*}\\] we have to convert each fraction into sixths as a common multiple of \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) is \\(6\\).

This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nDivide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\)\r\n\r\nFirst we set up the long division by writing\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nNow we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\]\r\nBring down\r\nBring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) In other words4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing a higher order polynomial\r\nThe basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nDivide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFirst we write the long division as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\). That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(x^{3}\\) to get \\(x^{2}\\) and write\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) and write as below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}\\)and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2\\phantom{bbbi+11x)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nBring down\r\nBring down the \\(11x\\) term and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nDivide\r\nWe now repeat the algorithm. We divide the highest power of \\(x-1\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\). That is, we divide \\(x\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x\\) and write as follows.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,\\,-5x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(-5x\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) from \\(-5x^{2}+11x\\) to get \\(6x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ - \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x \\phantom{)-6} \\end{array}\\]\r\nBring down\r\nBring down the \\(-6\\) and write as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nDivide\r\nDivide the leading term of \\(x-1\\) into the leading term of \\(6x-6.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(6x\\) to get \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x-1\\) by \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(6x-6-\\left(6x-6\\right)\\) to get \\(0\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nAs there are no more terms to bring down, we stop the algorithm. Our result is that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6=\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best interpretation as we can then factorise the quadratic term on the RHS to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Which is of value when we are trying to graph \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\) as it gives us the \\(x-\\)intercepts of the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nDivide \\(\\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe major difference from example 2 above is that there is no \\(x^{2}\\) term in \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1. \\end{align*}\\] We get around this by writing \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =2x^{3}+0x^{2}-3x+1 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThat is, we set up the long division as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nand apply the algorithm used in Example 1 and 2 above.\r\n\r\nApplying the algorithm we obtain:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nHence we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =2x^{2}+2x-1 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\times\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn your work, the final result as shown above is all that is required.

You don't need to write full sentences in the subject line.\r\n \tIf you're emailing regarding a specific unit, add the unit code or title. Your lecturers and tutors usually teach more than one unit, so including the unit code can help them to figure out which unit you are emailing about.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nFinal assignment extension-Unit B.S.1452\r\n Remember \r\n\r\n \tUse your RMIT student email for your university communications.\r\n \tAcademic emails are expected to be formal, so avoid slang, abbreviations, or emojis in your emails unless you know the recipient well.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Terms of address or greetings\"]Studies have shown that your email greeting can have an impact on whether the recipient decides to continue reading. These tips will help you choose the right greeting.\r\n\r\nHow well do you know the person?\r\nIf you have never met or emailed a staff member, it is better to be formal. For example, you can use their academic title and their last name.\r\n\r\nAsk \r\nIf possible, ask the recipient how they would like you to address them. For example, by their first name, their title or last name.\r\n\r\nCheck the title and preferred pronouns \r\nAcademic staff at university usually have a page in the staff directory where you can find more about their title or preferred pronouns (e.g. he\/she\/they).\r\n\r\nChoose an appropriate salutation \r\nIf this is your first time emailing someone, choose a formal salutation like Dear. Avoid colloquial and informal salutations like G'day or Hey. You should only use informal salutations if you know the person well.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of email greetings and when to use them.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Content\"]Staff at university may receive numerous emails every day, so it is important to be concise and explain your questions or requests clearly.\r\n\r\nImportant points come first\r\nPut the essential information at the start of your email.\r\n\r\nShort and explicit\r\nMake sure to explain your questions and requests briefly and explicitly. Avoid adding unnecessary details.\r\n\r\nStructured and concise\r\nWrite the content in paragraphs but make sure to make them as short as possible.\r\n\r\nUse bullet points to explain your main points\r\nIf your email contains a lot of content, use lists or bullet points rather than long paragraphs. Bullet points are easier to read and follow.\r\n\r\nInclude student ID and\/or unit code\r\nIf your email is about a specific unit, make sure to mention the name or unit code in your email or subject line. It's also helpful to include your student ID in your email so the recipient can find your information faster.\r\n\r\nBe formal and polite\r\nEmails are legal documents, so you should make sure that your language is formal and respectful. Avoid discussing any non-academic issues in your emails when contacting university staff.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Sign off\"]Like greetings, email closings should be selected carefully and according to the purpose of the email and your relationship with the email recipient.\r\n\r\nAt the end of your email, include a thank you message and choose an email ending that matches the formality of your greeting.\r\n\r\nInclude your full name and student ID, if you have not included it in the body of your email.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]","excerpt":"There are times at university when you need to email your lecturers, tutors, or other university staff members to communicate personal or non-public matters.

In this video I'm going to give you some tips on how to make a good impression online. It's important to remember that university is an academic and professional space. You could be studying among future employers or colleagues.\r\n\r\nSo how can you put your best foot forward online? When you're speaking, it's nice to turn your camera on if you can, so that your classmates and teacher can get to know you. Position the camera so that you are facing straight on, it might help to prop your laptop or computer up with a stand or some books. Try sitting in front of a window so that the natural sunlight lights your face. Think about your background. What's behind you? Can you angle yourself so that you have a neutral background? Of course, it's not always possible to turn your camera on or sit in front of a window or have a nice background but just do your best and don't let this stop you from contributing in class.\r\n\r\nIt's also helpful to mute your microphone when you aren't speaking. This minimises the background noise for everyone else. If your teacher puts you in a breakout room, it can help you to engage with your group members if you switch your camera on. If you can't switch your camera on, that's OK! Just let your group members know that you're still there, you're listening, and you're ready to talk.\r\n\r\nAlways try to be culturally sensitive and use inclusive language when you speak to your classmates and teachers. Be aware of making jokes and using sarcasm as humour can easily be misinterpreted online. Avoid using slang words as not everyone may understand these. And never use offensive language! Proofread what you type before you press send. And remember, the main class chat is not a place to have private discussions! Whether you are typing a message in the class chat, giving a presentation, responding on a discussion board, or speaking aloud in an online class, remember to be polite and respect others' points of view. Show people the same courtesy online that you would in person.\r\n\r\nSo, use these tips. Make the most of your online classes and join in! Contribute your ideas and listen to others. Ask questions and remember there are lots of places in the university where you can ask for support such as the Library, IT, and Student Connect.\r\n\r\nI hope these tips have been helpful. See you later!\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]","excerpt":"Communicating clearly and having positive interactions with your classmates and teachers is just as important in online classes as it is in person.

After all, what is more important than the safety of our families? Critics, generally made up of people who have never served their country, argue that conscription is an outdated and coercive practice, but they overlook the significant benefits it can bring to both individuals and the nation. Countries with mandatory conscription have stronger, more resilient defence forces. By requiring all eligible young adults to serve, Australia would ensure a steady influx of trained personnel, ready to respond to any threats. Furthermore, conscription fosters discipline, teamwork, and a sense of responsibility, qualities that are invaluable in both military and civilian life.\r\n\r\nMandatory conscription can serve as a powerful equaliser in society, providing opportunities for personal growth and development that might otherwise be inaccessible. Research published in the Journal of Military and Strategic Studies indicates that conscription programmes often lead to increased social cohesion and a greater understanding of national values. A common concensus across a number of researchers suggests that young Australians from diverse backgrounds would come together, breaking down social barriers and building lasting bonds. Critics who claim that conscription disrupts education and career plans fail to recognise the long-term advantages of the skills and experiences gained through military service. In fact, I would say that the vast majority of former conscripts would say that their time in the military was instrumental in shaping their future success.\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Answer key\"]\r\nHere are sample answers for the activity.\r\nContention\r\nCountries with mandatory conscription have stronger, more resilient defence forces.

In order to manipulate expressions containing brackets it is necessary to remove them first. This module discusses how to remove brackets.   [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, I'm Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on removing brackets in algebra. The law that allows us to expand expressions with brackets in maths is called the distributive law. For instance, A brackets B plus C, is the same as A times B plus A times C, you're multiplying the term outside the brackets by the term inside the brackets, an alternate way of writing A times brackets B plus C, same thing, A times B plus A times C. Before we get into some of the examples just recall some of our work we've done in the past, multiplying positive and negative numbers. Remember if the signs are the same, plus plus or minus minus the answer is positive, if the signs are different, plus and minus, then the answer is negative. So let's use this law and multiply out this particular expression just with numbers; two times brackets three plus five, so we're going two times three plus two times five, two times three is six, two times five is ten, answer is 16. Let's look at another example but here we're using algebra; three brackets X plus two, we use the same law again, three times X plus three times two, which is three X plus six, notice we can't add three X to six because the terms are different. Similarly with negative signs, minus five brackets M plus four gives us minus five times M plus minus five times four, which is minus five M minus 20, the terms are different so they must be left alone. And finally, with two negative signs, so be careful here, minus two brackets P minus seven is minus two times P plus minus two times minus seven, which is minus two P plus 14. Let's now move on with two sets of brackets, four brackets M minus three plus two brackets M plus one. We use the same ideas as before giving us four M minus 12 plus two M plus two, collect the like terms and we've got six M minus 10. Similarly, two sets of brackets but this time we have to be really careful because there's a negative sign. Minus six X brackets two X plus three minus three X brackets X minus three gives us minus 12 X squared minus 18 X minus 3 X squared and there it is we've got plus 9 X at the end, two negatives give us a positive, collecting up the like terms we've got minus 15 X squared minus 9 X. Now let's looked at two sets of brackets that are placed side by side, in other words we're multiplying the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets. And if you look at the example in blue the idea is to multiply the first term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets and the second term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets, in other words X multiplied by X plus three plus two multiplied by X plus three. If we expand these brackets further we have X squared plus three X plus two X plus six and collecting the like terms gives us an answer of A squared plus five X plus six. Here are two more examples that have been written out for you. The one in blue at the top, notice there's a negative sign so be careful here with the negative signs, giving us an answer of M squared minus M minus 20 and the example in red there are two negative signs here, so be doubly careful when multiplying out these sets of brackets, giving us an answer of Q squared minus nine Q plus 18. Now try some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie. [\/lightweight-accordion]   The Distributive Law In what follow we will write \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)\\) which means \\(a\\times\\left(b+c\\right)\\). That is the \\(a\\) multiplies the bracket. We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\). The distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In words, the \\(a\\) outside the bracket multiplies everything inside the bracket. For example, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\left(3+5\\right) &amp; =2\\times3+2\\times5. \\end{align*}\\] Removing the brackets is called expansion.  Examples  Expand \\(3\\left(x+2\\right)\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =3\\times x+3\\times2\\\\ &amp; =3x+6. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(-5\\left(m+4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -5\\left(m+4\\right) &amp; =\\left(-5\\right)\\times m+\\left(-5\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-5m-20. \\end{align*}\\] Usually we omit the first step shown above and expand directly as shown in the following examples. Expand \\(-2\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =-2p+14. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(e\\left(e+2\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} e\\left(e+2\\right) &amp; =e^{2}+2e. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(-\\left(4p-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -\\left(4p-3\\right) &amp; =-4p+3. \\end{align*}\\] Expand and simplify \\(4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right) &amp; =4x-12+2x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x-10. \\end{align*}\\] Expand and simplify \\(6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right) &amp; =12k^{2}+18k-3k^{2}+9k\\\\ &amp; =9k^{2}+27k. \\end{align*}\\] Now do some practice. See Exercise \\(1\\).     Binomial Products A binomial product is something like \\(\\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right).\\) It is the product of two binomial terms.1 A binomial term is an expression involving two terms. Examples are: \\(a+3\\), \\(1+c,\\) \\(a+b,\\) and \\(\\left(3x+2y\\right)\\).  To expand the two brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. Then simplify if possible. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right) &amp; =m\\left(m+3\\right)+2\\left(m+3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+3m+2m+6\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+5m+6. \\end{align*}\\] Symbolically we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)\\left(c+d\\right) &amp; =ac+ad+bc+bd. \\end{align*}\\]  Two Important Cases Special cases arise when the binomial terms are the same. That is \\(\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)=\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)=\\left(a-b\\right)^{2}\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+ab+ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-ab-ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These occur often in mathematics and you should commit them to memory.   Examples  Expand \\(\\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right) &amp; =2fg+\\left(2f\\right)\\left(5h\\right)+3g+15h\\\\ &amp; =2fg+10fh+3g+15h. \\end{align*}\\] In this case not further simplification is possible. Expand \\(\\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =p^{2}-7p-2p+14\\\\ &amp; =p^{2}-9p+14 \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(\\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right) &amp; =2w^{2}-8w+3w-12\\\\ &amp; =2w^{2}-5w-12 \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(\\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-12rs-12sr+9s^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] This can be done faster if you remember eqn (2) above: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r\\right)^{2}-2\\left(4r\\right)\\left(3s\\right)+\\left(-3s\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] For some practice, please try out Exercise 2.

Understanding the basics of using these online tools to share, edit, and save documents will be extremely useful to your future working life and make group assignments easier and more efficient.\r\nWhat is an online collaboration platform?\r\nAn online collaboration platform is a digital workspace, which allows people to collaborate no matter where they are. Online platforms often include cloud storage and office applications, and sometimes chat, email, and online forums. Some examples are Microsoft 365 and Google Drive.\r\nWhat is a co-authoring tool?\r\nCo-authoring files can be stored in the cloud and shared with other people so that real-time reviewing and editing can take place, like it would in an office or classroom. These tools generally include features such as autosave, comments, track changes, user tagging, version history, and notifications. For example, Microsoft Word and Google Docs co-authoring tools allow multiple people to work on the same file at the same time.\r\nKey terms\r\nWhile collaborating online, you will likely come across the following key terms:\r\nLocal file: A digital file stored on your personal computer.\r\nCloud file: A digital file stored on internet servers (the cloud) rather than on your computer, which can be kept private or shared with others.\r\nCo-authoring: Collaborative authoring (working on a document together at the same time).\r\nReal-time editing: Working together on a document at the same time rather than working individually and sending updates.\r\nCollaboration steps\r\nBy following these three steps, you will be able to set your group up for online collaboration success.\r\nStep 1: Decide as a group which collaboration platform and tools you are going to use.\r\nStep 2: Create your online collaboration space.\r\nStep 3: Start creating, sharing, and co-authoring your work as a group.\r\nChoosing your collaboration tools\r\nRemember that the best option for a collaboration tool is the one which suits the whole group. Keep in mind that not everyone has used these tools before, so you might need to assist some group members in setting up collaboration spaces and documents, or you might need to ask them to help you - that's all part of group work!\r\nHere are some of the available options:\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Microsoft 365\"]\r\n\r\nYou are probably familiar with Microsoft Word, a word processing application, which is part of the Microsoft Office Suite. Other Microsoft applications include Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, and SharePoint. All of these applications, and more, have been packaged together to create Microsoft 365, to which RMIT students have free access and live tech support.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already set up your student Microsoft account, you can find out how to access your free account on the Software and Apps page.\r\n\r\nRMIT students using Microsoft 365 can also receive technical support by contacting the IT Support Centre.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Office applications\"]\r\n\r\nOnline applications like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint allow you and your group members to co-author documents and edit in real time. Rather than emailing updates back and forth to each other, which is a slow process, you and your group members can work simultaneously on the same document and leave comments for later changes.\r\n\r\nLearn more about using Office applications to collaborate on your work:\r\n\r\n \tCo-author in Microsoft Office\r\n \tCollaborate on Word documents\r\n \tWork together on PowerPoint presentations\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"OneDrive\"]\r\nOneDrive gives you 1TB (that's a lot!) of personal cloud storage space. You can store photos, videos, and documents on the cloud without using up local space on your computer. You can make your documents in OneDrive private or share access with other people. For example, you could share a Word document from OneDrive and allow your group members to view or co-edit it.\r\n\r\nLearn more about using OneDrive tool: Get started with OneDrive.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"SharePoint\"]\r\nSharePoint is a collaborative platform where online teams can keep shared work. It has many similarities to OneDrive, but the main difference is that OneDrive is for personal files, and nothing is shared unless you choose to share it. On the other hand, SharePoint folders are collaborative and everything is shared, unless you choose to make it private. SharePoint is good for long group work projects, or multiple group work projects, as it allows you to keep things well organised within your group.\r\n\r\nLearn more about using this tool:  Get started with SharePoint \r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Other tools\"]\r\nThere are many other online tools (outside of Microsoft 365) which can be used to facilitate online collaboration, such as the ones below. However, please be aware that specialised tech support is not available for these tools through RMIT.\r\n\r\nGoogle Drive is a cloud storage platform which offers 15GB of free storage for users with a Google account. From Google Drive you can create, store, and share documents made using the G Suite of Office applications, including Google Docs and Google Slides.\r\n\r\nDropbox is another cloud storage platform which allows users to create, store, and share both Microsoft Office documents and G Suite documents. Their basic plan, which is free, offers 2GB of space. Consider whether this will be enough storage space for your group before choosing Dropbox as your collaboration platform.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n","excerpt":"When your group has decided how to keep in touch, it\u2019s time to consider how you will work together from separate locations.

On this page, you'll find some of the terminology you'll need to get started, along with explanations and examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContention\r\nA contention is the main point of view or opinion the writer is wanting to convey to the reader, usually supported by the claims.\r\nAn author's contention is the main claim they're trying to prove throughout their article.\r\n\r\n \tPlacing their contention at the beginning is the most direct method, and has the effect of positioning the reader to the author's beliefs from the outset.\r\n \tA contention placed at the end of an article can have the effect of seeming like a valid, logical conclusion to a well-thought through discussion.\r\n \tThe contention can also be repeated throughout the article. The author may have chosen to present it in this way in order to continue reiterating their main point in the audience's minds, aligning them to their views.\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Contention example\"]\r\nExcerpt from a sample article\r\nRead these two paragraphs from an article titled 'The Hidden Costs of Free Tertiary Education' by Professor Charmaine Lee from the University of South State. \r\nThe highlighted section indicates the contention of the article.\r\n[highlight-text key=\"1:Contention\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this text uses visual highlights to indicate the different elements of an argument.

Proponents argue that removing tuition fees will make higher education accessible to everyone, but they fail to consider the financial burden this will place on universities. [hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the contention.\"]As anyone with experience in the tertiary sector will tell you, without the revenue generated from tuition fees, universities will no be able to maintain the high standards of education and research that they currently uphold. The quality of education is likely to suffer as institutions will be forced to cut costs, potentially leading to larger class sizes, reduced course offerings, and diminished resources for students. This not only undermines the academic experience but also jeopardises the global competitiveness of our universities.[\/hl]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the concept of free tertiary education does not address the underlying issues of equitable access and student success. Studies assert that simply eliminating tuition fees does not necessarily result in higher enrolment or completion rates among disadvantaged students. For instance, data from the National Centre for Education Statistics shows that targeted financial aid and support services are more effective in helping these students succeed. By reallocating funds from tuition revenue to cover the costs of free education, universities may be unable to provide the necessary scholarships, mentorship programmes, and academic support that are crucial for student retention and success. Consequently, the push for free education could inadvertently and irresponsibly widen the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students, contrary to its intended goal.\r\n\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\nArgument\r\nThis is a key message that a writer wants to convey to the readers to support their contention. The writer will use of range of key arguments to support their contention. The writer will use language and evidence to try to persuade you to a particular point of view.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the contention of the overall argument you are making, you will need to identify key arguments (can be called sub-arguments) to support the overall contention of the article. This argument should take a strong stance so readers understand exactly what your claim is.\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Argument example\"]\r\nIn this example, the same excerpt from Professor Lee's article has the argument highlighted.\r\n[highlight-text key=\"2:Argument\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this text uses visual highlights to indicate the different elements of an argument.

You need to be able to determine the quality of evidence as being strong or weak. Also consider whether the writer adequately presents evidence that contradicts their argument. This can indicate a writer that is present a balanced perspective.\r\n\r\n \tStrong evidence: Sufficient evidence, high quality evidence.\r\n \tWeak evidence: Insufficient evidence, poor quality evidence.\r\n\r\nA contention needs to be supported by relevant, reliable, credible, sufficient and current evidence.\r\n\r\nIf there is no evidence, it isn't an argument - it is only an opinion, a description, or an explanation.\r\n\r\nQuestion the evidence the author has used.\r\n\r\n \tDoes the evidence provided support the argument?\r\n \tHow credible (trustworthy) is the evidence?\r\n \tHas enough evidence been presented?\r\n \tDoes it come from different sources?\r\n \tAre there any missing links between the evidence and the author's contention?\r\n \tIs the evidence current?\r\n \tIs there other evidence available that might challenge the evidence used?\r\n\r\nTake notice of linking words and phrases which demonstrate cause\/reason, effect\/results, to help identify the evidence used to support the argument.\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Evidence example\"]\r\nIn this example, the same excerpt from Professor Lee's article has the evidence highlighted.\r\n[highlight-text key=\"4:Strong evidence|5:Weak evidence\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this text uses visual highlights to indicate the different elements of an argument.

This is an assertion of the writer's viewpoint, and is used to prove the writers point by using attacking and putting down persuasion techniques against the opponent or idea. These methods are often effective in placing the reader in a position of agreement with the writer.\r\n\r\nEmotional language:: Words used to deliberately create an emotional impact or response from the audience. The effect of using emotive language as a persuasive technique is to appeal to people's emotions and trigger an emotional response.\r\n\r\nHyperbole: A hyperbole is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point for emphasis. They are not meant to be taken literally. By using a hyperbole, a story can quickly become interesting or sound more convincing.

Most presentation platforms provide a recording function which you can use to rehearse and review your presentation.\r\n\r\nWhen delivering online, your audience might not always have their cameras on, which means you can't see their reactions or make eye contact with them. Instead, try to focus more on your voice: speak enthusiastically, at a natural volume, and try not to speak too fast.\r\n\r\nLearn about the basic features of the platform you're using, so you can make your presentation more engaging and interactive. These might include screensharing, audience polls, reaction icons, whiteboard, and chat.\r\n\r\nExpect some lagging, and at some points poor internet connection, and be prepared to deal with technical interruptions which may arise.\r\n\r\nIt's good to explain what you're doing behind the scenes, e.g. \"I will now share my screen\".

Let's take a look at what's involved at each stage.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the topic\r\nThe first step in the critical analysis of a text is identifying the topic.\r\n\r\n'Topic' refers to the word or sentence which states the main subject of the work. The 'work' is the author's explanation of the topic. The topic is often identified in the main title and it should be clear from the abstract or opening paragraph what the topic is. Topics answer the questions of who, what and why through data and facts.\r\n\r\nOnce you have identified the topic, it's time to start the critical thinking process, which has three key elements:\r\n\r\n \tanalyse\r\n \tevaluate\r\n \tsynthesise.\r\n\r\nAnalyse\r\nWhen you analyse, you identify the parts of an argument.

This page contains all you need to know to get started with these models.\r\nThe Lewis electron-dot model is based on the fact that all atoms combine to give compounds in which each atom or ion achieves the noble gas valence electron configuration of \\(s^{2}p^{6}\\) (or \\(s^{2}\\) for hydrogen) in its valence shell, as this is the most stable configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Structures of Molecular Compounds\r\nDraw the Lewis structure of \\(\\ce{SO}_{2}\\) \r\n\r\nStep 1 - Count the total number of valence shell electrons of all the atoms involved in the molecule\r\nSulphur dioxide has two sulphur atoms and one oxygen atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtom\r\nAtomic number\r\nElectron configuration\r\nValence shell electrons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{S}\\)\r\n\\(16\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(6\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(8\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(6\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal number of valence shell electrons \\(=6+\\left(6\\times2\\right)=18\\)\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Predict the central atom.\r\n\r\nThe atom that can form most bonds is considered as the central atom. If two different atoms can form the same number of bonds, then the least electronegative atom should be the central atom. Among sulphur and oxygen, sulphur is the least electronegative atom.\r\n\r\nStep 3 - Draw the bonds connected to the central atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4 - Add the lone pairs of electrons to the atoms connected to the central atom.\r\n\r\nCalculate the remaining valence electrons after drawing bonds. Four valence electrons are used for two bonds.\r\n\r\nRemaining valence electrons \\(=18-4=14\\). These fourteen valence electrons can be distributed among atoms connected to the central atom as lone pairs to complete the octet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5 - Assign lone pairs of electrons to the central atom if any valence electrons remain.\r\n\r\n\\(14-12=2\\)\r\n\r\nTo assign lone pairs to the connected atoms, we have used twelve electrons. Therefore, we have two electrons remaining, which can be allocated to the central atom as a lone pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6 - If the central atom still lacks the octet, create multiple bonds with connected atoms using lone pairs of electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince sulphur has not acquired the octet, create a double bond with one of the oxygens using a lone pair. With the double bond, all three atoms have acquired an octet. Finally, calculate the formal charges for each atom. Formal charges should be closer to zero for each atom.

Eager to learn more? Keep reading!\r\nIn a covalent bond, the difference between the electronegativity of participating atoms is smaller than the ionic bonds. Covalent bonds are usually formed between elements within the \\(p\\) block. Atoms held together by covalent bonds give rise to molecular compounds.\r\nExamples: \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), \\(\\ce{HF}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtoms involved in a covalent bond acquire the octet in their valence shell by sharing electrons between atoms. Generally, the number of covalent bonds an atom forms depends on how many electrons an atom requires to achieve an octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms four covalent bonds as \\(\\ce{C}\\) \\(\\left(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{2}\\right)\\) needs four more electrons to acquire an octet in their valence shell. A few more examples are listed in the following table.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nElement\r\nElectron configuration\r\nElectrons required to fill the octet\r\nNumber of covalent bonds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{N}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3}\\)\r\n\\(3\\)\r\n\\(3\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(2\\)\r\n\\(2\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{F}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{5}\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{H}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{1}\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the number of covalent bonds formed by an atom is not always guided by the octet rule. For instance, \\(\\ce{S}\\) can form four or six covalent bonds such as \\(\\ce{SF}_{4}\\) and \\(\\ce{SF}_{6}\\). Some of the other exceptions to the octet rule are \\(\\ce{BF}_{3}\\), \\(\\ce{PCl}_{5}\\) and some of the \\(p\\) block elements in period four as they have empty \\(d\\) orbitals.\r\n\r\nMultiple covalent bonds\r\nMultiple covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when they share more than one pair of electrons to acquire valence shell octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{CO}_{2}\\): \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms two covalent bonds (2 pairs of electrons or 4 electrons) with each oxygen atom involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEthyne is another example where carbon forms multiple bonds. In this case, one carbon atom forms a triple bond (6 electrons or 3 electron pairs) with another carbon atom to complete the octet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle bonds: when two electrons are shared between two atoms.\r\n\r\nDouble bonds: when four electrons are shared between two atoms.\r\n\r\nTriple bonds: when six electrons are shared between two atoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoordinate covalent bonds\r\nWhen the shared electrons between two atoms are donated only by one atom, the resulting bond is known as a coordinate covalent bond. In a typical covalent bond, both atoms donate electrons to the bond. In contrast, in a coordinate covalent bond, an atom with a filled orbital shares its two electrons with an empty orbital of another atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples: \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) ion and \\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\) ion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolar Covalent Bonds\r\nUneven sharing of two electrons creates a single covalent bond, but with a significant ionic component due to the difference in electronegativity, resulting in a distorted polarised molecular electron cloud. For instance, \\(\\ce{HF}\\): \\(\\ce{H}\\)'s EN - EN \\(=\\) electronegativity: ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons - is 2.20. \\(\\ce{F}\\)'s EN is 3.98. The difference of EN \\(=3.98-2.2=1.78\\). Electrons are more strongly attracted to the more electronegative atom, in this case to \\(\\ce{F}\\). So, the electron-rich \\(\\ce{F}\\) has a partial negative charge (designated as \\(\\delta-\\) ), while electron-poor \\(\\ce{H}\\) has a partial positive charge \\(\\left(\\delta+\\right)\\), creating a dipole moment \\(\\left(\\mu\\right)\\). These types of bonds are known as polar covalent bonds.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the electronegativity of participating atoms in a bond indicates whether the bond is ionic, covalent or polar covalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronegativity difference\r\nType of bond\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\geqslant2.0\\)\r\nIonic\r\n\\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), \\(\\ce{CsF}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(0.5-1.9\\)\r\nPolar covalent\r\n\\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(0-0.4\\)\r\nCovalent\r\n\\(\\ce{CH}_{4}\\), \\(\\ce{O}_{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Polarity of Molecules\r\nThe net polarity of a molecule depends on the polarity of the individual bonds, the contribution from lone pairs, and the molecule's shape. In a polar molecule, electrons are more strongly attracted to one part of the molecule. For example, in the water molecule, due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom, electrons are strongly attracted towards the oxygen atom creating the net polarity point between two \\(\\ce{O}-\\ce{H}\\) bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, although the individual covalent bonds are polar, overall the molecule becomes non-polar due to the shape of the molecule. For instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has polar \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds. However, due to the linear symmetrical shape of the molecule, polar bonds (dipoles) cancel each other, creating a zero net polarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaming Binary Molecular Compounds\r\n\r\n \tThe name of the less electronegative atom is written first, followed by the more electronegative atom. Therefore, metals come before nonmetals, and nonmetals located on the left side of the periodic table are written before nonmetals located on the right side.\r\n \tThe name of the more electronegative atom should end with the suffix -ide as used for anions.\r\n \tDepending on the number of atoms of each element involved in the compound, prefixes such as di, tri, tetra, penta etc. may apply. For instance, compound \\(\\ce{CCl}_{4}\\) is named as \"Carbon tetrachloride\".\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular formula\r\nName of the compound\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{CO}\\)\r\nCarbon monoxide\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{CO}_{2}\\)\r\nCarbon dioxide\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{BBr}_{3}\\)\r\nBoron tribromide\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\ce{O}_{5}\\)\r\nDinitrogen pentoxide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR theory)\r\n\r\nVSEPR theory states that the shape of a molecule is determined by the number of electron clouds around the central atom. Lone pairs and bonded valence electrons are considered electron clouds. Due to the repulsion forces between electron clouds, they attempt to stay as far as possible. For instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has two electron clouds (two \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds) around the central atom \\(\\ce{C}\\). As a result of repulsion forces between these two electron clouds, the molecule is arranged into linear geometry with a bond angle of \\(180^{\\circ}\\). Multiple bonds such as double and triple bonds are considered one electron cloud.\r\n\r\nSteps to determine the shape of a molecule using VSEPR theory:\r\n\r\n \tDraw the Lewis structure of the molecule and identify the central atom.\r\nFor instance, in an ammonia molecule (\\(\\ce{NH}_{3})\\), the central atom is \\(\\ce{N}\\) as it forms most bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSum up the number of bonds and lone pairs connected to the central atom to get the total number of electron clouds around the central atom.\r\nExample: In the ammonia molecule, the central atom \\(\\ce{N}\\) has three bonds with each \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom and one lone pair. Therefore there are four electron clouds (three bonds and one lone pair) around the central atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAnticipate the shape of the molecule based on the number of electron clouds around the central atom.\r\nExample: Four electron clouds around \\(\\ce{N}\\) arrange in such a way that each cloud stays as far as possible from the others to minimise the repulsion forces between them. Generally, when there are four electron clouds around the central atom, these are arranged to result in a tetrahedral shape. A tetrahedron is composed of four equilateral triangles. The central atom is located in the centre and electron clouds are located towards the corners of the tetrahedron. Molecules with a tetrahedral shape have a bond angle of \\(109^{\\circ}\\). Due to the presence of a lone pair on one corner of the tetrahedron, the overall shape of ammonia becomes pyramidal rather than tetrahedral with a bond angle of \\(107^{\\circ}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of bonds\r\nNumber of lone pairs\r\nTotal number of electron clouds\r\nShape\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n0\r\n2\r\nLinear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n0\r\n3\r\nTrigonal planar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\nAngular\/bent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n0\r\n4\r\nTetrahedal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n1\r\n4\r\nPyramid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n2\r\n4\r\nAngular\/bent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen more than one central atom is present in the molecule, predict the molecular geometry of each central atom and then combine the results. For instance, \\(\\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{4}\\) has two central \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms. Each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom is attached to three electron clouds. This means each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom has a trigonal planar geometry. In this case, the whole molecule is also planar, as the bond angles \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{H}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{C}\\) are \\(120^{\\circ}\\) each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"\\[\\require{mhchem}\\] Covalent bonds are formed between atoms by sharing electrons.

Likewise, in chemistry, chemists consider: \\[ 1\\textrm{mole}=6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{objects} \\]\r\nThe objects can be anything such as houses, sand, eggs, or oranges. However, in chemistry, objects are mainly atoms, ions or molecules.\r\n\r\nOne mole of anything contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) objects. For instance, one mole of eggs contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) eggs, one mole of carbon contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) carbon atoms, one mole of carbon dioxide contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) carbon dioxide molecules.\r\n\r\nThe symbol of moles is \"mol\".\r\n\r\n \tThus, three moles of particles is three times \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\)particles \\(\\left(3\\times6.022\\times10^{23}\\right)\\), and ten moles of particles is ten times \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\)particles \\(\\left(10\\times6.022\\times10^{23}\\right)\\).\r\n \tIf we had \\(3.011\\times10^{24}\\) atoms of gold \\(\\left(\\ce{Au}\\right)\\), the number of mole, of gold would be:Moles of \\(\\ce{Au}=\\frac{3.011\\times10^{24}\\textrm{atoms}}{6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{atoms mole}^{-1}}=5.000\\textrm{mol}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nAvogadro's Number (N)\r\nAvogadro's number is the term used for \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) objects. \\[ N_{A}=6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{mol}^{-1} \\]\r\n\r\nAvogadro's number is the link between the number of atoms (or molecule or ions) of a material and the number of moles of material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolar Mass (\\(M\\))\r\nAtomic mass is the average mass of an atom of an element measured in atomic mass units (amu).\r\n\r\nOne atomic mass unit is equal to \\(1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}\\), which is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the mass of a \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atom. \\[ 1\\textrm{amu}=1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}=\\frac{1}{12}\\times\\textrm{mass of }^{12}\\ce{C}\\textrm{ atom} \\]\r\n\r\nThus, the mass of one \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atom is \\[ 1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}\\times12=1.99265\\times10^{-23}\\textrm{g} \\]\r\n\r\nThen the mass of a mole of \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atoms will be \\[ 1.99265\\times10^{-23}\\textrm{g}\\times6.02214\\times10^{23}\\textrm{mol}^{-1}=12.0000\\textrm{gmol}^{-1} \\]\r\n\r\nMolar mass is the mass of one mole of the substance.

Improve your knowledge of stoichiometry with the information on this page by learning about the stoichiometric coefficient, the molar ratio and chemical equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoichiometric coefficient\r\nThe stoichiometric coefficient is the number written immediately before the atoms, ions and molecules in a balanced chemical equation. These numbers indicate the ratio of any reactant or product that reacts or forms in a reaction.\r\n\r\nExample: Let's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia. The balanced chemical equation can be written as follows: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nThree, one and two are written in front of \\(\\ce{H},\\ce{N},\\ce{NH}_{3}\\), respectively, these are considered as stoichiometric coefficients. Stoichiometric coefficients in this reaction show that three molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of nitrogen gas to form two ammonia molecules. When there is no coefficient before an atom, ion or molecule, we interpret it as one. For instance, the coefficient of molecular nitrogen in this reaction is one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe molar ratio and chemical equations\r\nThe stoichiometric coefficients in a balanced chemical equation can also be interpreted on the molar scale. Let's consider the same example again: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nBased on the molar scale, we can say that three moles of hydrogen gas react with one mole of nitrogen gas to form two moles of ammonia gas. Molar scale interpretation relates to the quantities of substances involved in the reaction. Therefore, if we know the amount of one substance involved in the reaction, we can use the molar ratio to determine the amounts of others involved in the reaction.\r\n\r\nMoles calculations\r\nWorked Example 1: How many moles of ammonia gas can be produced from \\(0.18\\textrm{mol}\\) of hydrogen gas? \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nWe are asked to calculate the amount of ammonia and are given the moles of hydrogen and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. We need to find out the molar ratio of hydrogen and ammonia to calculate the amount of ammonia. From the stoichiometric coefficients, we know that three moles of hydrogen produce two moles of ammonia. Therefore, the molar ratio between hydrogen gas to ammonia gas is \\(3:2\\). Thus, if we use \\(0.18\\textrm{mol}\\) of hydrogen gas, we can produce the following amount of ammonia gas: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{NH}_{3}}{3\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}} &amp; \\times0.18\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}=0.12\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMass calculations\r\nWorked Example 2: The burning of methane gas \\(\\left(\\ce{CH}_{4}\\right)\\) in excess oxygen produces carbon dioxide gas and water vapour. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is as follows: \\[ \\ce{CH}_{4}\\left(g\\right)+2\\ce{O}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow\\ce{CO}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+2\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nHow many moles of water vapour can be obtained by the complete burning of \\(3.20\\textrm{g}\\) of methane gas? The molar mass of methane is \\(16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\).\r\n\r\nWe are asked to calculate the number of moles of water vapour and are given the mass of methane and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. To find the moles of water vapour, first, we need to find out the moles of methane. As the quantity of methane is given in grams, we need to convert it to moles using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\)1\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{3.20\\textrm{g}}{16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.200\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] To relate the amount of methane to the amount of water vapour, we need to know the molar ratio of the two. From the balanced chemical equation, we know one mole of methane produces two moles of water vapour. Therefore, \\(0.200\\textrm{mol}\\) of methane can produce the following amount of water vapour: \\[ \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{CH}_{4}}\\times0.200\\textrm{mol}\\ce{CH}_{4}=0.400\\textrm{mol} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimiting reagents and yields\r\n\r\n\r\nLimiting and excess reagents\r\n\r\nLet's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia gas again: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nBased on stoichiometry, we know that if we mix three moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) with one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\), we can obtain two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). In other words, \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) reacts with \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) in a molar ratio of \\(3:1\\). If we mix three moles of hydrogen gas and two moles of nitrogen gas, what will happen? Similarly, three moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) will react with one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) and produce two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). However, the entire quantity of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) will be used before the \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we start with the exact amount of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) required for the reaction. The product mixture will contain one unreacted mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we only required one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) for the reaction. If we had more \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), we could have produced more \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) as we already have excess \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\). Therefore, in this reaction, we call \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) the limiting reagent since it limits the production of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). Hence, the limiting reagent is the reactant that runs out first, limiting the formation of products. Nitrogen gas is called the excess reagent because we have a greater amount than required for the reaction.\r\n\r\nWorked Example: Phosphoric acid is produced by treating the phosphate rock, which contains calcium phosphate, with sulphuric acid, as follows: \\[ \\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}+3\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\rightarrow3\\ce{CaSO}_{4}+2\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4} \\]\r\n\r\nA chemist in a fertiliser production plant mixed \\(144.5\\textrm{g}\\) of calcium phosphate with \\(160.5\\textrm{g}\\) of sulphuric acid.

For that, find the number of moles of each reactant using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\).\r\n\r\nNumber of moles of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{144.5\\textrm{g}}{310.2\\textrm{ g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.4658\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNumber of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{160.5\\textrm{g}}{98.1\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =1.64\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThen, compare the calculated moles with the molar ratio of two reactants. According to the balanced chemical equation, calcium phosphate reacts with sulphuric acid in a \\(1:3\\) molar ratio. Therefore, \\(0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) reacts with the following number of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}}\\times0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2} &amp; =1.397\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe have \\(1.64\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) , but we only need \\(1.397\\textrm{mol}\\) for the reaction. This means we have excess \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) acid. Therefore, the limiting reagent is \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\). The quantity of limiting reagent can determine the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid formed.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Use the molar ratio between \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid to calculate the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid formed.\r\n\r\nWe know one mole of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) forms two moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid from the balanced chemical equation. Therefore, the number of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid forms from \\(0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}}\\times0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2} &amp; =0.9316\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNow, find the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ m &amp; =M\\times n\\\\ m &amp; =97.99\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\times0.9316\\textrm{mol}\\\\ m &amp; =91.29\\textrm{g} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nBased on the given reaction conditions, maximum mass we can obtain for \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid is \\(91.29\\textrm{g}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYields\r\n\r\nTheoretical yield is the maximum amount of the product that can form under the given reaction conditions. The available amount of limiting reagent determines the maximum amount of the product that can be formed. Theoretical yield can be calculated using the stoichiometric coefficients (or molar ratios) displayed in the balanced chemical equation. We calculate theoretical yield assuming no losses occur during the reaction, and all the reactants convert to products. However, in reality, often losses and inefficiencies occur during chemical reactions. Therefore, the actual amount you isolate and measure from a chemical reaction is less than the theoretically expected amount.\r\n\r\nThe actual yield of a product is the amount of the product you isolate from the chemical reaction. You can not calculate the actual yield. It must be determined experimentally. You need to isolate the product and weigh it to get the actual yield.\r\n\r\nPercentage yield \\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Actual yield}}{\\textrm{Theoretical yield}}\\times100 \\]\r\n\r\nPercentage yield indicates the success of the reaction. If the value is closer to the hundred, that means losses are minor, and most reactants have converted to products.\r\n\r\n1 Where, M=Molar mass (g\/mol) m=mass of the substance (g) n=Number of Moles (mol)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n @import\u00a0url(\"\/learninglab\/sites\/default\/files\/enhanced\/maths.css\");","excerpt":"\\[\\require{mhchem}\\] Stoichiometry describes the relationship between relative quantities of reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation.

On this page, you will learn about the main components of a chemical equation, and how to write and balance chemical equations.\r\nThe main components of a chemical equation are:\r\n\r\n \tReactants: The starting materials of the reaction. Reactants are written on the left side of the equation.\r\n \tProducts: The materials obtained at the end of the reaction and written on the right side of the equation.\r\n \tAn arrow is drawn between the reactants and products pointing towards the products to designate a chemical change.\r\n \tConditions required for the reaction to occur, for instance, pressure and temperature, are written above the arrow.\r\n \tPhysical state of the substances involved: This is written next to the chemical formulas using brackets and abbreviations, as shown next. Solid - (s), Liquid - (l), Gas - (g), Aqueous solution (a substance dissolved in water) - (aq)\r\n \tCoefficient: The numbers written before the chemical formulas to balance the chemical equation. 1\r\n\r\nLet's take the photosynthesis reaction that occurs in plants as an example.

Generally, it helps to start with the compound that is composed of the greatest number of atoms. First, focus on the element of that compound which has the highest number of atoms. Thus, choose hydrogen from ammonia to start the balancing. Ammonia contains three hydrogen atoms, while hydrogen on the left side has two atoms. Therefore, to balance the number of hydrogen atoms, six hydrogen atoms will be required for each side as six is the lowest possible number that both two and three can divide evenly. So, place two in front of ammonia and three in front of molecular hydrogen to obtain six hydrogen atoms on both sides. \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\ce{NH}_{3} &amp; \\qquad2\\times3=6\\\\ 3\\ce{H}_{2} &amp; \\qquad3\\times2=6\\\\ \\ce{N}_{2}+3\\ce{H}_{2} &amp; \\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tNext, balance the rest of the atoms in the selected compound.

Otherwise, balance the remaining atoms.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Do a final check to ensure all types of atoms in the equation are balanced.\r\nAt this point, the equation is balanced for both atoms present.

Generally, it helps to start with the compound that is composed of the greatest number of atoms. Focus first on the element of that compound which has the highest number of atoms.\r\nTherefore, start with hydrogen. The left side has six hydrogens, and the right side has two hydrogens.

Want to find out more? Keep reading!\r\n\r\nOxidation and reduction\r\nThe key chemical event in a redox reaction is the net movement of electrons from one reactant to the other. As a result of electron movement, some reactants gain electrons (reduction), and others lose electrons (oxidation).\r\n\r\nOxidation is the loss of electron(s) by an atom or ion.\r\n\r\nReduction is the gain of electron(s) by an atom or ion.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Overall reaction: \\[ \\ce{CuO}\\left(s\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu}\\left(s\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(g\\right) \\]\r\n\r\nWhere reduction is \\[ \\ce{Cu}^{2+}+2e\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu} \\]\r\n\r\nand oxidation is \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\rightarrow2\\ce{H}^{+}+2e \\]\r\n\r\nExample 2: The following chemical redox reaction: \\[ 2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+\\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag}+\\ce{Zn}^{2+} \\]\r\n\r\nCan be described by the two so-called electrochemical \"half reactions\": \\(\\ce{Ag}^{+}\\) is reduced \\[ 2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+2e\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag} \\]\r\n\r\nand \\(\\ce{Zn}\\) is oxidised \\[ \\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow\\ce{Zn}^{2+}+2e \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOxidising agents and reducing agents\r\nOxidising agents can oxidise another reactant by accepting electrons. Therefore, the oxidising agent becomes reduced (by gaining electrons) while oxidising another reactant (causing it to lose electrons).\r\n\r\nReducing agents reduce another reactant by offering electrons to the other reactant. Thus, the reducing agent becomes oxidised (by losing electrons) while reducing another reactant (causing it to gain electrons).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOxidation number\r\nIn any discussion of redox reactions it is useful to be able to assign an oxidation number to any element in a given compound in order to keep track of the electrons during a reaction. The oxidation number is defined as the apparent electrical charge on the atom according to a set of rules like those following.\r\n\r\nWe need to recognize that:\r\n\r\nOxidation leads to a loss of electrons, and an increase in the oxidation number.\r\n\r\nReduction is a gain of electrons, and so leads to a decrease in the oxidation number.\r\n\r\nOxidation number rules\r\n\r\n \tThe oxidation number of an atom as an element is zero. Examples: \\(\\ce{O}_{2},\\ce{P}_{4},\\ce{Fe},\\ce{Br}_{2}\\) are the elemental forms at room temperature, and they all have an oxidation number of zero.\r\n \tThe oxidation number of oxygen is usually \\(-2\\) (except when bonded to \\(\\ce{F}\\)). Remember that in the element, oxygen \\(\\left(\\ce{O}_{2}\\right)\\) has an oxidation number of zero, whilst in peroxides \\(\\left(\\ce{O}_{2}^{2-}\\right)\\) each oxygen atom has an oxidation number of \\(-1\\).\r\n \tThe oxidation number of a monoatomic ion is equal to the ion's charge. Examples: \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}=\\ce{Na}\\left(+1\\right),\\ce{Cl}^{-}=\\ce{Cl}\\left(-1\\right),\\ce{S}^{2-}=\\ce{S}\\left(-2\\right)\\).\r\n \tThe algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral polyatomic compound is zero; in a polyatomic ion the sum of the oxidation number is equal to the ion's overall charge.\r\n \tIn a combination of elements, the more electronegative element has its characteristic negative oxidation number (for example, \\(\\left(-3\\right)\\) for nitrogen, \\(\\left(-2\\right)\\) for oxygen, \\(\\left(-1\\right)\\) for chlorine), and the more electropositive element has a positive oxidation number (for example, \\(\\left(+1\\right)\\) for hydrogen, \\(\\left(+2\\right)\\) for calcium, \\(\\left(+3\\right)\\) for aluminium).\r\n \tThe oxidation number of hydrogen is usually \\(+1\\) due to its electronegativity being lower than that of the main-group elements to which it is normally bonded. With more electropositive elements, hydrogen has an oxidation number of \\(\\left(-1\\right)\\). For instance, \\(\\ce{NaH}=\\ce{Na}^{+}\\ce{H}^{-}\\).\r\n\r\nExample 1: Find the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\left(aq\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nUsing oxidation number rule \\(4\\), we can write:\r\n\r\n\\(2\\times\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}+\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}+4\\times\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}=0\\)\r\n\r\nRule \\(2\\) states the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(-2\\) and rule \\(6\\) states the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}\\) is \\(+1\\)\r\n\r\nLets consider the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) as \"\\(x\\)\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\times\\left(+1\\right)+x+4\\times\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 2+x-8 &amp; =0\\\\ x-6 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =+6 \\end{align*}\\] Example 2: Find the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{I}\\), in \\(\\ce{ICl}_{4}^{-}\\).\r\n\r\nWe use rule \\(4\\) to write:\r\n\r\n\\(\\left(\\textrm{oxidation number of }\\ce{I}\\right)+\\left(4\\times\\textrm{oxidation number of }\\ce{Cl}\\right)=-1\\)\r\n\r\nAccording to rule \\(3,\\) since \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) is more electronegative than \\(\\ce{I}\\), so \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) has the conventional oxidation number of \\(-1\\). Let's consider the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{I}\\) as \\(x\\).\r\n\r\nThus, \\[\\begin{align*} x+4\\times\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1\\\\ x-4 &amp; =-1\\\\ x &amp; =-1+4\\\\ x &amp; =+3 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPredicting the products of an oxidation or reduction reaction\r\n\r\nWe can predict the outcome of the reaction between two redox couples such as \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\/\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) in the following way:\r\n\r\nBecause each redox reaction involves the movement of electrons, it also a voltage associated with it. This is called the standard reduction potential \\(\\left(E^{0}\\right)\\) which is defined according to \\[ Ox^{n+}+ne^{-}\\rightarrow Red \\]\r\n\r\nWhere \\(Ox^{n+}=\\) the oxidised form of the element,\r\n\r\n\\(Red=\\) the reduced form of the element,\r\n\r\n\\(n=\\) the number of electrons transferred in the redox half-reactions\r\n\r\n\\(E^{0}\\) range:\r\n\r\n\\(E^{0}=\\) Standard reduction potential, this is the electron driving force for the reaction as it proceeds from left to right when both \\(Ox^{n+}\\) and \\(Red\\) are present at \\(1M\\) concentration (or one atmosphere partial pressure for gases), and at \\(25^{0}C.\\)\r\n\r\nNOTE: The greater (more positive) the value of \\(E^{0}\\), the greater the tendency for: \\(Ox^{n+}+ne^{-}\\rightarrow Red\\)\r\n\r\nSo, from the data in the table below we can decide on the spontaneous (favourable) reaction:\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\\(Ox^{n+}\/Red\\) couple\r\n\\(E^{0}\\)(volt)\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) donor\/acceptor\r\nOxidising or Reducing Agents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\)\r\n\\(+1.51\\)\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) acceptors\r\nOxidising agent\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\/\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\left(\\ce{SO}_{2}\\right)\\)\r\n\\(+0.17\\)\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) donor\r\nReducing agent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to note that the redox couple with the more positive \\(E^{0}\\) value will remove electrons from a redox couple with a less positive \\(E^{0}\\). The oxidising agent is the species which causes the oxidation to occur, i.e. It is the agent (redox couple) which removes electrons from the other couple.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) has the more positive \\(E^{0}\\) and hence the greater affinity (liking) for electrons: therefore \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) will be as the electron acceptor (i.e. Oxidant= oxidising agent). The sulphur system must donate electrons: hence \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) will be the electron donor (ie Reducing agent).\r\n\r\nSo we predict: \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduction and oxidation half-reactions and the balancing of redox equations\r\n\r\nRedox equations are usually written as balanced net ionic equations, with spectator ions (ions that do not take part in the overall redox process) being omitted.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the stoichiometry of a redox reaction can be difficult to deduce even when the products of such a reaction are known. For this reason it is much more convenient and methodical to concentrate upon the stoichiometry of each redox \"half-reaction\" or \"redox couple\" individually.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalancing net ionic equations for redox reactions\r\n\r\nA five step method for balancing redox equations, called the \"half-reaction\" method, is used, and after mastering these operations, any chemical redox equation can be balanced by combining the five steps.\r\n\r\n \tDivide the equation into the appropriate \"half-reactions\" which can be balanced separately, for example:\r\nOverall reaction \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+\\ce{Mn}^{2+} \\] Assign an oxidation number to each element in the ions or molecules of reactants and products:\r\nThe oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) in \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) is \\(+7\\) and the \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) oxidation number in \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) is \\(+2\\)\r\nThus, \\(\\ce{Mn}^{7+}\\)is being reduced to \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\).\r\nSo, the reduction half-reaction is \\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+} \\] The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) is \\(+4\\), and the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) ion is \\(+6\\)\r\nSo, \\(\\ce{S}\\) is being oxidised from \\(+4\\rightarrow+6\\).\r\nSo, the oxidation half-reaction \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-} \\]\r\n \tWrite a separate balanced chemical equation for each redox-active species. This is the mass balance step:\r\nAdd water to balance oxygen.\r\n\\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\] Add \\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\) to balance hydrogens. \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+} \\]\r\n \tAlthough we have now achieved mass balance, we also need to balance the charge, by adding electrons (negative charge) as needed. This generates the balanced electrochemical half-reaction. The total charge on each side of a balanced reaction must be the same. \\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}+5e\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\] Left hand side (LHS) total charge \\(=+2\\)\r\nRight hand side (RHS) total charge \\(=+2\\)\r\nAnd \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}+2e \\] LHS total charge \\(=0\\)\r\nRHS total charge \\(=0\\)\r\nIf all three steps have been done correctly, one half-reaction will have electrons on the left hand side of the equation (the reduction half-reaction), while the other half-reaction will have electrons on the right hand side of the equation (the oxidation half-reaction).\r\n \tThe balanced half-reactions can be termed electrochemical equations, since they involve the electrons. To obtain a chemical equation for the reaction, we need to eliminate the electrons from the overall equation.\r\nHence the fourth step is the addition of the two half-reactions in such a way that the electrons cancel out. This may require multiplying one equation or both, by an appropriate integer.\r\nFor the two half-reactions above:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 2 &amp; \\left\\{ 5e+8\\ce{H}^{+}\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\right\\} \\\\ 5 &amp; \\left\\{ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}+2e\\right\\} \\end{align*}\\] The first reaction is multiplied by two and the second reaction is multiplied by five, and both are added to give: \\[ 5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+2\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+16\\ce{H}^{+}+5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+10e\\rightleftarrows2\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+5\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+20\\ce{H}^{+}+8\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+10e \\] Note the equal number of electrons on each side of the equation cancel out.\r\n \tThe final step is to cancel the electrons and simplify the chemical equation by eliminating any chemical species common to each side of the equation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLHS\r\nRHS\r\nBalance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(16\\ce{H}^{+}\\)\r\n\\(20\\ce{H}^{+}\\)\r\n\\(20-16=4\\ce{H}^{+}\\)on RHS\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(8\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(8-5=3\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\) on RHS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[ 5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+2\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightleftarrows2\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+5\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+3\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\ce{4H}^{+} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (function() { var script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.type = \"text\/javascript\"; script.src = \"https:\/\/mathjax.rstudio.com\/latest\/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\"; document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script); })(); ","excerpt":"\\[\\require{mhchem}\\] A redox reaction, short for reduction-oxidation reaction, is a chemical process in which one substance loses electrons (oxidation) while another gains electrons (reduction).

When we dissolve a solute in a solvent, we can obtain a solution.\r\n\\[\\require{mhchem}\\]\r\nSolute, solvent and solution\r\nA solution is composed of a solute and a solvent. When we dissolve a solute in a solvent, we can obtain a solution. To prepare a solution, a known mass of solute (e.g. \\(5.85\\textrm{g}\\) of \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\)) is dissolved in a solvent such as liquid water to give a known volume of solution (e.g. \\(250.0\\textrm{ml}\\) aqueous solution).\r\n\r\nIn a solution, the solvent can be liquid water or something else such as alcohol-based solvents, acetone and ethyl ether. If the solvent is liquid water, we call the solution an aqueous solution. If the solvent is not liquid water, we call it a nonaqueous solution.\r\nSolubility\r\nIn general, solubility depends on whether the solute (usually a solid) is ionic or molecular and whether the solvent liquid contains polar or non-polar molecules.\r\nIonic solutes in polar solvents\r\nExample: Solubility of sodium chloride in water.\r\n\r\nForces between the ions (\\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)): electrostatic interactions\r\n\r\nForces between solvent (\\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)) molecules: dipole-dipole interactions (electrostatic interactions)\r\n\r\nSo, the nature of the forces between solute and solvent are comparable. Hence, the strong electrostatic forces between ions in the crystal lattice can be matched by the ion-dipole electrostatic interaction between ions and the polar solvent molecules. Thus, we can expect ionic (polar) solutes to be soluble in polar solvents.\r\nMolecular solutes in non-polar solvents\r\nExample: Solubility of iodine (\\(\\ce{I}_{2}\\)) in octane (\\(\\ce{C}_{8}\\ce{H}_{18}\\)).\r\n\r\nForces between solute molecules (\\(\\ce{I}_{2}\\)) : Van der Waals forces\r\n\r\nForces between solvent (\\(\\ce{C}_{8}\\ce{H}_{18}\\)) molecules: Van der Waals forces\r\n\r\nThe forces between the solute and the solvent molecules are comparable. Hence we can expect solubility. In this case, both solute and the solvent are molecular, so when solute contacts solvent, the molecules freely intermingle. Molecular compounds (e.g. iodine) are therefore generally soluble in non-polar liquids (e.g. Hydrocarbons such as octane).\r\nSolubility rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Like dissolves like.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents.\r\n\r\nNon-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents.\r\n\r\nCompare the water solubility of hexane and glucose.\r\n\r\n \tWater is a polar liquid.\r\n \tHexane \\(\\left(\\ce{C}_{6}\\ce{H}_{14}\\right)\\) is a hydrocarbon chain. Therefore, it is a non-polar solute. So hexane is insoluble in water.\r\n \tGlucose \\(\\ce{C}_{6}\\ce{H}_{12}\\ce{O}_{6}\\) is a polar solute due to the presence of many hydroxyl groups \\(\\left(\\ce{OH}\\right)\\) in its structure. Thus, glucose is soluble in water.\r\n\r\nInfluence of temperature on solubility\r\nMany solids show increased solubility in water at higher temperature. In contrast, gases display low solubility in water with increased temperature.\r\nSaturated, supersaturated and unsaturated solutions\r\nThe unsaturated solution contains fewer solutes than the maximum amount that can be dissolved under given conditions.\r\n\r\nA saturated solution is a solution that contains the maximum amount of solutes that can be dissolved under the given conditions. In a saturated solution, an undissolved solid can be observed on the bottom of the container. There is a dynamic equilibrium between dissolved solutes and undissolved solutes at the molecular level. Some of the dissolved solutes crystallise back, and some of the undissolved solutes dissolve into the solution creating a dynamic equilibrium, even though you can not observe that with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nA supersaturated solution contains more dissolved solute molecules than a saturated solution - this is an unstable temporary condition. A supersaturated solution always tries to revert to a saturated state with time.","excerpt":"A solution is composed of a solute and a solvent.

Molarity indicates the number of moles present in \\(1000\\textrm{ml}\\). So, we can use molarity as a conversion factor to calculate the number of moles present in a given volume as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{1.50\\textrm{mol}}{1000\\textrm{ml}}\\times250\\textrm{ml}\\\\ = &amp; 0.375\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 2: How many grams of glucose are present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) of a \\(1.5\\textrm{M}\\) glucose solution?

As in the previous example, we can use molarity as the conversion factor to get the number of moles of the solute present in the given volume.

The concentrated solution is known as the stock solution. However, the amount of solute present in the solution remains constant before and after the dilution; only the volume changes. The following equation shows the relationship between concentration and volume before and after dilution. This equation is built upon the fact that the same amount of solute is present in the solution before (stock solution) and after (diluted solution) the dilution. \\[ C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2} \\]\r\n\r\nWhere;\r\n\r\n\\(C_{1}\\)= Concentration of the stock solution\r\n\r\n\\(V_{1}\\)= Volume of the stock solution\r\n\r\n\\(C_{2}\\)= Concentration of the diluted solution\r\n\r\n\\(V_{2}\\)= Volume of the diluted solution\r\n\r\nExample: A chemist prepared \\(10\\textrm{ml}\\) of a \\(1.00\\textrm{M}\\) \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) solution by adding water to the \\(3.0\\textrm{M}\\) stock solution of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\). How much stock solution should be taken for the dilution?\r\n\r\nWe are given the concentration of the diluted solution, the volume of the diluted solution, concentration of the stock solution, and we are asked to calculate the volume of the stock solution used for the dilution. As the number of solute moles remains constant before and after the dilution, we can use the equation \\(C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}\\) to calculate the volume of the stock solution. \\[\\begin{align*} C_{1}V_{1} &amp; =C_{2}V_{2}\\\\ 3.0\\textrm{M}\\times V_{1} &amp; =1.0\\textrm{M}\\times10\\textrm{ml}\\\\ V_{1} &amp; =\\frac{1.0\\textrm{M}\\times10\\textrm{ml}}{3.0\\textrm{M}}\\\\ V_{1} &amp; =3.3\\textrm{ml} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"\\[\\require{mhchem}\\] Concentration refers to the amount of solute present in a given quantity (known volume) of a solution.

It classifies elements into categories and makes predictions about elements that have not yet been found by humans. Let's take a look at how it came to be in its current form.\r\n\r\nAlchemical table to periodic table\r\nBefore modern science, elements referred to earth, air, water, and fire. The periodic table grew from the alchemical table. The alchemical table was also a way of ordering elements and substances and their corresponding symbols. As more elements were discovered and a modern understanding of chemistry emerged, some things were removed from the table and others were added, beginning with phosphorus. Hennig Brand is the first person credited with discovering a modern element. Brand was an alchemist searching for the philosopher's stone. He distilled many substances, including urine, and from human urine he made pure phosphorus.\r\nAdding oxygen to the mix\r\nAntoine Lavoisier is called the father of modern chemistry by many. Lavoisier discovered oxygen and hydrogen and correctly explained the role of oxygen in combustion \u2013 fire. Lavoisier also predicted the existence of silica. His work was ground-breaking and very important to modern chemistry. Many people contributed to the history of chemistry and the periodic table and discovered elements, building on the work of Lavoisier.\r\nAtomic weight\r\nMendeleev was a Russian scientist who moved elements into the table structure we know today. HIs big breakthrough on the periodic table came in 1869 when he arranged the elements on the table by atomic weight, starting with the lightest elements. By ordering the elements by atomic weight, and into columns, he was able to correctly predict elements that had not yet been discovered. Mendeleev also knew that the proposed atomic weights of some elements were incorrect, and again correctly predicted what the actual weight is.\r\nPeriodic law\r\nGrouping the elements by atomic weight also led to Mendeleev discovering the periodic law. This law states that by grouping elements by atomic weight, we see cyclical trends in their properties emerging in a predictable and stable way.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) have an interactive periodic table where you can learn the history of each element and who discovered it.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage by 2012rc via Wikimedia Commons, licensed under CC BY 3.0 ","excerpt":"The periodic table is a single image that contains all the elements that we know exist in the universe.

An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.\r\nThis task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics.\r\n\r\nAs with other types of vectors (displacement, velocity, etc.), a force vector can be thought of as being the sum of several other vectors. Imagining that a single force is made up of several forces can greatly simplify calculations, particularly using two imaginary ones at right angles to each other. Usually broken up into vertical and horizontal components. We discuss how to calculate these components in this module.\r\n\r\nComponents of a force\r\nIf you pull on an object with a force \\(\\vec{F}\\) (see diagram below left), the effect is the same as two other people pulling with forces \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) at right angles to each other , one horizontal and the other vertical (see diagram below right).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vector triangle showing the force \\(\\vec{F}\\) and its component vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is shown.\r\n\r\nThe force \\(\\vec{F}\\) can be imagined as having two parts, or components, \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) that are at right angles to each other. \\(\\vec{a}\\) is usually called the horizontal component and \\(\\vec{b}\\) the vertical component of \\(\\vec{F}\\). The components are often called rectangular components because they are at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the diagram at right it can be seen that the magnitude of the vectors give:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{\\left|b\\right|}}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransposing gives:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{\\left|b\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\sin\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransposing gives:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nCalculate the rectangular components of a force of 10 Newton that acts in a direction of North 30 degrees East?\r\n\r\nSince there is 90 degrees in a right angle triangle we can deduce that the direction of force can be shown as East 60 degrees North.\r\n\r\nThe force and its rectangular components are shown.

Different parameters must be used for each line, say \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). If the lines intersect, there must be values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) that give the same point on each of the lines. If this is not the case, the lines do not intersect.\r\n\r\nThe basic approach is:\r\n\r\n \twrite each line in parametric form\r\n \tsolve the simultaneous equations for the parameters\r\n \tif a solution exists the line intersect, if not they don\u2019t intersect.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFind the point of intersection of the two lines \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) where \\(L_{1}\\) is the line represented by the equation \\(\\frac{x-5}{1}=\\frac{y-1}{-1}=\\frac{z-8}{-3}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) is the line \\(x=1+2s\\) ; \\(y=-4+s\\) ; \\(z=8-2s.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nLine \\(L_{2}\\) is already in parametric form: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =1+2s &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =-4+s &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-2s &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now write \\(L_{1}\\) in parametric form. Set1 As \\(L_{2}\\) is using the parameter \\(s\\) we choose a parameter \\(t\\) in what follows. It doesn\u2019t matter what you use but it must be different from \\(s.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{y-1}{-1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{z-8}{-3} &amp; =t. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =5+t &amp; \\left(5\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =1-t &amp; \\left(6\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-3t &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTo find the point of intersection of these two lines, we must find a point \\(P\\) that lies on both lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the point of intersection the coordinates for \\(L_{1}\\) will equal the coordinates for \\(L_{2}\\). This means there exist values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) such that the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates of the two lines are equal.\r\n\r\nEquating the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates, we get from equations \\(\\left(2-7\\right):\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x,$ }5+t= &amp; 1+2s\\\\ 4= &amp; 2s-t &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $y,$ }1-t= &amp; -4+s\\\\ 5= &amp; s+t &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $z,$ }8-3t= &amp; 8-2s\\\\ 0= &amp; 3t-2s. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] If we add equations \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(9\\right)\\) we get \\(9=3s\\) and so \\(s=3\\).\r\n\r\nIf \\(s=3\\) we can substitute this into all of the above equations \\(\\left(8-9\\right)\\) and find that \\(t=2\\). Note that you must check all equations. 2 You must check that \\(s=3\\) and \\(t=2\\) satisfies all three equations. It is common that they satisfy only \\(2\\) of the \\(3\\) equations as shown below in Example 2. \r\n\r\nThe solution is therefore\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =3\\\\ t &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTo find the point of intersection, substitute the \\(s\\) value into the \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{2}\\) or substitute the \\(t\\) value into \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{1}\\).

The following figure illustrates the meaning of the directional derivative:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nSuppose that we wish to find the directional derivative of \\(f\\left(x,y\\right)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at the point \\(\\left(2,3\\right)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\vec{u}=4\\vec{i}-3\\vec{j}\\).\r\nSolution\r\nThe first step is to find the vector \u201cgrad f\u201d, symbolised thus \\(\\nabla f\\).\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\vec{i} &amp; +\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\vec{j}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn this particular case \\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f &amp; =2x\\vec{i}+2y\\vec{j}\\\\ &amp; =4\\vec{i}+6\\vec{j} \\end{align*}\\] at the point where \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=3\\) .\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find the dot product of this vector \\(\\nabla f\\), and \\(\\hat{u}\\), the unit vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{u}\\).\r\n\r\nIn this case \\(\\vec{u}=4i-3j\\), therefore \\(\\hat{u}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left(4i-3j\\right)\\)\r\n\r\nHence the directional derivative of \\(f\\) in the direction of \\(u\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} D_{u} &amp; =\\left(4i+6j\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{5}i-\\frac{3}{5}j\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{16}{5}-\\frac{18}{5}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2}{5}. \\end{align*}\\] To generalise the above, the directional derivative of a function, \\(f\\), in the direction of \\(u\\) is \\[ D_{u}=\\nabla f\\cdot\\hat{u} \\] where \\[ \\nabla f=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}i+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}j+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}k. \\] Since the directional derivative relies on a dot product, (remember \\(\\vec{a}.\\vec{b}=\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\theta\\)), it will be a maximum when \\(\\cos\\theta\\) is maximum (that is, \\(\\cos\\theta=1\\)), so the directional derivative will be maximum when \\(\\theta=0\\).\r\n\r\nIn other words, we can say that\r\n\r\n \t\\(D_{u}\\) will be maximum when \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are in the same direction.\r\n \t\\(D_{u}\\) will have its greatest negative value when \\(u\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are in opposite directions (when \\(\\theta=\\pi\\)).\r\n \t\\(D_{u}\\) will be zero when \\(u\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are at right angles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nIf \\(f\\left(x,y,z\\right)=x^{2}+y^{2}+xyz\\), find a unit vector \\(\\hat{u}\\) such that the rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(\\left(2,3,-1\\right)\\) in the direction of \\(u\\) is maximum.\r\nSolution\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f= &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\hat{i}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}\\\\ = &amp; \\left(2x+yz\\right)\\hat{i}+\\left(2y+xz\\right)\\hat{j}+\\left(xy\\right)\\hat{k}\\\\ = &amp; \\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor the directional derivative to be maximum, \\(u=\\nabla f\\)\r\n\r\nTherefore \\(u=\\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k}\\) and \\(\\hat{u}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{53}}\\left(\\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k}\\right)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \tFind the directional derivative of the given function at the given point in the direction of the indicated vector:\r\n\\(\\text{a) }\\) \\(f\\left(x,y\\right)=xy^{2},\\,\\left(3,2\\right),\\,4\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}\\)\r\n\\(\\text{b) }\\) \\(f\\left(x,y\\right)=e^{xy},\\,\\left(0,2\\right),\\,\\hat{i}\\)\r\n\\(\\text{c) }\\) \\(f\\left(x,y,z\\right)=x^{2}y^{3}z,\\,\\left(2,-1,3\\right),\\,\\hat{i}-2\\hat{j}-2\\hat{k}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tFind the unit vector in the direction in which \\(f\\) increases most rapidly at \\(P\\left(1,\\pi\/2\\right)\\) for \\(f\\left(x,y\\right)=x^{2}+\\cos xy\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"] \r\n\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\text{a) }\\) \\(\\frac{52}{5}\\quad\\text{b) $2$ $\\quad\\text{c) $-\\frac{76}{3}$ }$ }.\\)\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\hat{u}=0.394\\hat{i}-0.919\\hat{j}.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion] \r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page: V11 Directional derivatives (PDF 157KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"If you are on the side of a hill, the gradient depends on the direction you look.

Sample executive summary  [1] The study is a quantitative investigation of university graduates' awareness of social media [SM] use in the recruitment process. [2] Likert-scaled questionnaires were emailed to randomly selected students approaching the end of their course in three departments of the university. [3] The results showed that most students did not agree with the proposition that various social media platforms were used for screening. [4] This indicates a significant underestimation of how prevalent SM is as a recruitment and screening tool despite the prevalence SM has in the lives of the cohort sample. [5] It was recommended that explicit awareness raising be integrated into Careers &amp; Employment communications and professionally oriented courses.

Sample introduction  [1] There has been an increase in the use of social media over recent years in the recruitment and job-seeking process with every indication that this practice will continue to expand. Social media has become a tool for potential employers to gather information and evaluate a candidate's suitability for a job. While this practice has become widespread, there is little in the way of systematic approaches to using social media as a recruitment tool. Expectations about social media presence are seldom explicit, and both potential employers and employees need clarity on appropriate use of this information. [2] This report will discuss research into graduating students awareness of social media usage as a recruitment tool for graduate employment.    Middle (body) Organise the sections in a logical sequence based on:  how you investigated the issue or problem (method, methodology, materials, participants, length of study time) what you found through the investigation, (results) what judgements\/ interpretations you have made about the process or the findings (discussion, analysis)  Method\/methodology The method section of a report details how the research was conducted, the research methods used and the reasons for choosing those methods. It should:  outline the participants and research methods used, e.g. surveys\/questionnaire, interviews refer to other relevant studies.  The methodology is a step-by-step explanation of the research process. It should be:  factual mainly written in past tense.  The method section of a scientific\/engineering report provides:  an explanation of the experimental procedures (so that the experiment can be repeated for validation in the future). mainly written in passive tense.  Sample methodology   Use the buttons to explore the sample methodology.  The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009). This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated graduates attitudes and knowledge of the use of social media in recruitment (see Appendix 1). The questionnaire used a 4-point Likert scale to assess awareness (Jones 2007) and attitudes towards social media in recruitment and provided open-ended responses for additional comments. The survey was voluntary and anonymous. A total of 412 questionnaires were distributed online to randomly selected graduating students from each of the three colleges within the university. The completed questionnaires were returned by email.  methodprocedurerelevant studyparticipantsShow all    The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:  What happened? What was found?  There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts. Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section. Presenting the data Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to explain or illustrate a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but is supportive, then it can be an appendix to the report but still referred to within the text. Dot points\/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information. Sample results There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.

It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues\/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:  state\/identify the main research findings\/themes interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean link the results to other research.  Identifying the major themes in the results will help structure the discussion. This will keep the report focussed on specific points that have developed from the data or research. This helps to clarify identifiable outcomes which can often be used as headings. Sample discussion  This study highlights the lack of awareness amongst graduate job seekers of the use of social media for recruitment. The practice of employers accessing the personal profiles of potential employees is widespread and is not considered to be an ethical issue by employers. As the data (Smith &amp; Watson, 2014) demonstrates, over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% check Facebook and Twitter when considering candidates who have applied for positions. Further, Starr's (2015) research of school leavers indicates that less than 25% are aware of what privacy settings they use on social media and even fewer were aware that these sites may be used for judging people for various reasons (see Appendix 2). Clearly. the job seeking public needs to be made aware that employers are increasingly accessing their personal profiles on social media for recruitment purposes. Educating the public on the consequences of this recruitment practice needs to start early.  discussion of results link to other research student analysis\/ comments     End Reports are often about solving problems or exploring issues. The end of the report should give the reader a sense of outcome and future direction after the body. Conclusion This is a summary statement of key findings or outcomes. Have your aims been successful or not? Was your hypothesis proven to be true? A synthesis and interpretation of findings makes them meaningful for the reader. Sample conclusion  Usage of social media in recruitment is widely established and expected to increase as social media becomes further integrated with business and personal lifestyles. Current research has found that over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% engage with Facebook and Twitter when making decisions about the appropriateness of prospective employees. However results show that graduates were sufficiently aware or alarmed by this practice and the potential discriminatory effect on their employment opportunities.  synthesis and interpretation     Recommendations A good way to present your recommendations is to list them in bullet points for easy reading. What actions do you suggest, given your conclusions? What questions for further study are raised by this research or investigation? Sample recommendations   There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.   Awareness of these issues should be introduced in the early years of a course. This would allow students to cultivate career appropriate social media profiles and practices before these issues become crucial.     References This is a list of all the sources referred to in the report. This should be on a separate page and should be done in accordance with the referencing style chosen by your school. Author date systems list the references in alphabetical order of the first author's surname. Footnoting styles list them in order of their appearance in the report.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.    .nav-stacked {float:left; width: 30%;} .tab-content {float:left; width: 60%;} .clear {clear: both;} ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1543 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Home Profile Messages Settings home profile messages What is Lorem Ipsum?

Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point.\r\nA derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.\r\n\r\n(See also Functions and graphs)\r\n\r\nGradient of a curve\r\nIn this module we are concerned with finding a formula for the slope or gradient of the tangent at any point on a given curve \\(y\\)=\\(f(x)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formula \\(m=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\) may be used to find the gradient of a line when two points on the line, \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right)\\) are known.1 There are two special cases that have to be dealt with: horizontal and vertical lines. A horizontal line parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis with equation of the form \\(y=k\\) where \\(k\\) is a constant, has a gradient of zero. As a line becomes closer to vertical its gradient gets larger. A vertical line parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis with equation of the form \\(x=c\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant has a gradient which is undefined.\r\n\r\nConsider the gradient of the curve defined by \\(y=f(x)\\) at the point P (ie the gradient of the tangent line AB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gradient cannot be calculated as only one point (the point \\(P\\)) on the line is known. But the point \\(P\\) has coordinates \\(\\left(x,f(x)\\right)\\)and the point \\(Q\\) has coordinates \\(\\left(x+h,f(x+h)\\right)\\). The gradient of the line \\(PQ\\) can be calculated and this can be used to approximate the gradient of \\(AB\\). The gradient of \\(PQ\\) = \\(\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\). As the value of \\(h\\) decreases (i.e \\(Q\\) becomes closer to the point \\(P\\)), the approximation of the gradient is more accurate.

Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point. A derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.

The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent.\r\nIf you go looking for the horizontal tangents (i.e. where the derivative = 0), you will be able to pinpoint the maxima or minima of a curve.\r\n\r\nUsing calculus we can find the derivative of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and use this to find maximum and minimum values of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and the values of \\(x\\) where they occur. We can therefore use calculus to solve problems that involve maximizing or minimizing functions.\r\n\r\nDefinition\r\nThe maximum or minimum values of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) occur when the derivative \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSecond Derivative Test\r\nLet \\(x\\) satisfy \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) then if \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\"}\\left(x\\right) &amp; \\begin{cases} =0,\\text{ $x$ is an inflection point}\\\\ &lt;0\\text{, $f\\left(x\\right)$ is a local maximum}\\\\ &gt;0\\text{, $f\\left(x\\right)$ is a local minimum.} \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nThe distance \\(s\\,km,\\) to the nearest \\(km\\), of a fishing boat from port at any time, \\(t\\) hours, is given by the formula \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =2+8t-2.5t^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] When is the boat furthest from port and what is its distance from the port at that time?\r\nSolution\r\nFor a maximum or minimum, \\(ds\/dt=0.\\) That is\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{ds}{dt} &amp; =8-5t\\\\ &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] So, \\[\\begin{align*} 8-5t &amp; =0\\\\ 5t &amp; =8\\\\ t &amp; =1.6\\text{ hours.} \\end{align*}\\] Now this could be a maximum or minimum distance. However, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}s}{dt^{2}} &amp; =-5\\\\ &amp; &lt;0. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(t=1.6\\) is a maximum. When \\(t=1.6\\) hours, the distance from port, \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =2+8(1.6)-2.5\\left(1.6\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =8.4\\,km. \\end{align*}\\] The boat is furthest from port after \\(1.6\\) hours and the distance from port, at that time, is \\(8.4\\,km\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nFind the maximum product of two numbers that have a sum of \\(10.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nLet the numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} a+b &amp; =10. &amp; \\left(2.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Let the product of the two numbers be \\(P\\) so \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =a\\times b. \\end{align*}\\] From \\(\\left(2.1\\right)\\)1 We need to get \\(P\\) in terms of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) so that we take a derivative like \\(dP\/da\\) or \\(dP\/db\\). In this case we write \\(P\\) as a function of \\(b\\) but identical results are obtained is we make \\(P\\) a function of \\(a.\\)  \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =10-b \\end{align*}\\] so \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =\\left(10-b\\right)b\\\\ &amp; =10b-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dP}{db} &amp; =10-2b. \\end{align*}\\] For a maximum or minimum, \\(dP\/db=0,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 10-2b &amp; =0\\\\ 2b &amp; =10\\\\ b &amp; =5. &amp; \\left(2.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] But \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}P}{db^{2}} &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; &lt;0 \\end{align*}\\] and we have a maximum.

In fact, it was not until 1833 that people began calling themselves \"scientists\". Before that time, people studied natural philosophy, the study of nature, causes, astrology and many more subjects. Astrology, medicine, magic, and experiments were used in alchemy to understand the world and to create new substances. What we now think of as science came from natural philosophy and alchemy.   Photo by Joanna Kosinska on  Unsplash Turning lead to gold Alchemy was the art of attempting to transmute or to change metals, particularly lead, into gold. For many thousands of years, alchemists had tried to unlock the secrets of matter, to bring great wealth and create a cure for all diseases. Alchemists believed that by studying the stars, metals, herbs and other substances, they could find a way to create the philosopher's stone. The philosopher's stone was believed to cure all disease, turn metals to gold and make people immortal. For over four thousand years and across many countries, alchemy was practised by people who believed that matter could be classified and understood through experiments. We can describe alchemy as the start of the system of modern science in many parts of the world. Of the modern sciences, chemistry is the closest to alchemy in name and in practice. Classifying matter into different elements, states and categories was an alchemical pursuit. The alchemical table   You may recognise some of the elements included on the alchemical table. Some of the metals named here are still very much a part of modern science and our understanding of matter. Other components, such as the four elements, are no longer part of scientific beliefs. Chemistry is born Robert Boyle published \"The Sceptical Chymist\" at the end of the 17th century. This book disproved the idea that matter was made of a mix of some or all of the four elements; earth, fire, air and wind. Instead, Boyle used new equipment and experiments to prove his theories about the world. This emphasis on experiments that could be repeated anywhere and give the same results was not new, but Boyle helped to set the standards for the modern chemist. In the 19th century, the scientific method and the separation of the sciences into specific disciplines became the hallmarks of modern science.","excerpt":"Isaac Newton would not have said he was a scientist, but he would have said he was an alchemist, or someone who practised alchemy.

Predicting how an acid will react when you add a base will save your cakes in food technology, keep your cleaning products active in industrial chemistry, and get the ph. of your fertiliser just right.  Modern agriculture and farming could not exist without chemistry. All plants need sunlight and water, and today we know that plants also need a mix of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorous to grow. Knowing which elements plants need to grow is vital to creating large farms that can feed today's populations.  As well as knowing which chemicals are needed for farming, we need to know where to find supplies of these elements, or how to make them. Modern life depends on creating nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus, to grow the plants we need to feed ourselves, not just the fruits and vegetables we enjoy but also the feed for dairy, chickens, and other farm animals. Careers with chemistry Atoms and elements are the foundations of chemistry, and chemistry is the foundation of many careers. Chemistry is also needed to succeed in; health and medicine, all the different fields of engineering, food technology, textiles, construction, architecture, geology, aeronautics, design, archaeology and so much more.

It is generally made up of one main idea and a group of supporting sentences. Paragraphs are the basic unit for building longer pieces of writing.\r\n\r\nThe importance of paragraphs\r\nThis short video explains why writing good paragraphs in your assessment tasks is important. It also introduces the easy-to-follow TEEL structure for your paragraphs to improve your writing skills.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MxaHGEB6eb8\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nIf information is organised and your main points are clear, you will get better marks. Making your ideas and arguments stand out is mostly done through having clear and well-structured paragraphs. A really good way to write paragraphs is to use the TEEL structure:\r\n\r\n \tTopic Sentence: The topic of the paragraph\r\n \tExplain: Why is the topic important?\r\n \tEvidence\/Example: Support the topic (references)\r\n \tLink: Link back to the topic\r\n\r\nThis is an example:\r\n\r\n\"One factor within the team that seems to be important is the notion of team cohesiveness. Team cohesiveness enables a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals. Addison (1996, p. 107) argues that highly cohesive teams 'are more effective at achieving goals they set for themselves, and have higher member satisfaction'. For example, cohesive teams are more likely to have high morale (Smith 1996) and the ability to cooperate, and so work effectively together (McAlfee &amp; Champagne 1987). Therefore, team cohesiveness enhances team effectiveness.\"\r\n\r\nSee how the topic sentence tells you the main idea of the paragraph. The rest just supports this main idea. If it doesn't relate to the main idea, it doesn't belong in the paragraph. It is sort of like a formula for writing.\r\n\r\nLinking your ideas helps the paragraph to flow and it shows how your analysis has developed. Have a look at the examples. The paragraph with linking words flows and it easy to read.\r\n\r\nSeparate sentences: \"Many countries are in recession\", and \"China's economy is growing\".\u00a0 These are two separate ideas, so how do we link them?\r\n\r\nRevised sentence: \"Although many countries are in recession, China's economy is growing\". The linking word in the paragraph here is \"Although\".\r\n\r\nHere are a few more linking words: \"furthermore\u2026\", \"in addition\u2026\", \"however\u2026\", \"as a result\u2026\", \"although\u2026\". \"therefore\u2026\".\r\n\r\nThe paragraph with linking words flows and it easy to read. Without linking words, it is disjointed and more difficult to follow. By using linking words, it looks like you have thought more deeply about your research.\r\n\r\nFor more information about paragraphs, try the tutorial.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nParagraph structure\r\n\r\nWell structured paragraphs are important because if the information is well organised it is easier to read.

The information on this page will help get you started.\r\n\r\nPart 1: What is it and why?\r\nThis video introduces the concept of the case study and identifies how case studies differ to other written assignments.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PUcRGc_UhWs\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nThe most important thing in writing up a case study report is that first, second, and thirdly: It is about the patient, not the condition nor the treatment. Students often put the emphasis on the condition or the treatment because the question usually focuses on this. While you need to explore these things, you still have to bring it back to the patient, and keep the patient central to the whole assignment.\r\n\r\nWe can understand if busy medical professionals start to see their patients in terms of a condition to be fixed, or a procedure to be performed. But ideally, we should remember that a patient is a person with a complex array of needs and preferences. This means that a simple textbook answer is not always best for them.\r\n\r\nIn your career, you will need to negotiate adjustments and anticipate problems particular to the patient. It does not make sense to discuss a condition in isolation from the individual. Each patient has their own unique kaleidoscope of history, personality type, fears, medical challenges, needs during recovery, so forth and so on. You need to see their condition or their treatment overall, as part of the whole person. Writing a case study teaches you to do that, if you don\u2019t explore the condition or treatment as part of a holistic system, you case study becomes theoretical, it becomes another essay.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s compare the case study to the essays you might have already written. The case study in nursing explores a particular patient\u2019s situation, while your essays will more likely have focused on disease, a treatment, a concept, or a system. A case study is very grounded in the real and the now, even if the patient is a hypothetical invention. It still provides some fairly authentic experience with dealing with an individual patient.\r\n\r\nEssays, on the other hand, tend to be literature-based. Of course, you need to do a lot of research and reading for your case study too, but the difference is for a case study you must always view and evaluate the information in the context of your patient. So in a case study, you need to show that you can find and apply information to you patient. For an essay you need to look at the information itself, pull it apart and evaluate it for its own sake.\r\n\r\nSo even if the question looks like an essay, don\u2019t be distracted. There is still an expectation to relate this to the patient. It is possible to explore the content and theory in a generalised way throughout the assignment, but the beginning of the assignment (and the beginning of each paragraph, in fact) should foreground you're patient and their relationship to this theory.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nPart 2: Research and writing\r\nThis video provides tips on how to research and structure paragraphs in order to keep a patient centred emphasis in the writing.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cxNtekgP6iM\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nAn essay, as opposed to a case study, usually has an question or a thesis which defines the boundaries of what you research, You aim to keep it within those parameters. and you delve as deeply as you can into the material. It loses focus if you include stuff outside of the topic.\r\n\r\nWith a case study, however, your focus is the patient so you need to cast your net widely and generously at first to find something that is relevant to them. And then when you find something relevant, you need to research deeply. So, doing a good case study report involves a lot more reading than you might think. You\u2019ll have to research both generally and deeply.\r\n\r\nThere can be a lot of research, and fairly unguided research involved in a case study. Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s like a reading comprehension exercise, the problems are not always clearly defined and the solutions have not necessarily been covered in lectures. Think of your case study as a mystery puzzle with a few clues scattered through it.\r\n\r\nIn reality, patients do not arrive with instructions, so it\u2019s up to the professional to notice that it is obvious and to think outside of the box. It is up to you to anticipate problems for the patient, it is up to you to follow through with the threads of any clues, and to see if they offer any valuable information, and these may only be hinted at indirectly. With years of nursing experience, the clues and danger signs get easier to spot, but it is very challenging for a beginner if you don\u2019t know what to look for, and that is why the broad reading is important.\r\n\r\nSo, every piece of information about your patient is valuable. When the information is given in the assignment, the facts are not random facts, they have usually been included for a reason, so use them and use them as much as you can. You may, on the other hand, have been told very little in the assignment and be expected to elicit the information yourself from the patient, through a blog, or a question-and-answer session. Asking for more details about their own condition just gives you more details about their condition, and unless you have some reasoning in mind for asking about that, more details per se is usually not that very helpful.\r\n\r\nInstead, ask about things that may affect the treatment or recovery; ask about things that may complicate matters. Smoking, relevant illnesses, lack of family support, strenuous lifestyles or jobs are all factors that may generate important decisions about how the patient is treated or cared for. The secret to keeping it about the patient is to keep them foremost into the discussion. You do this by making them the subject of each paragraph, and you do this by making them feature in the topic sentence: at the beginning and, if possible, a summary sentence at the end.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a paragraph, you have more flexibility to talk about the procedure or the condition in a more general way. But, at the end of the day, you need to remind us of how this is important for your patient. If you don\u2019t, your writing becomes an essay rather than a case study. And if you feel like you\u2019re being asked to research and to discuss material that is not directly relevant to your patient, you can make it relevant by at least explaining why it is not relevant. Remember, everything you write about should be in relation to your patient.\r\n\r\nSo remember, it is all about the patient, keep everything relevant to the patient; keep the patient in mind throughout the research and the writing. Explore and discuss what the question requires, but theory for the sake of theory should be avoided. Your mission is to find the best solutions available for your patient, and develop the best understanding that you can of your patient.\r\n\r\nYou have now complete the Case Study module.

It was developed in the 1800s when mathematicians were asked to theorise on such matters as the annual number of wrongful criminal convictions in a particular country or to work out the number of soldiers in the Prussian cavalry who were likely to be kicked to death by a horse (honest!).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poisson distribution measures the probability that a certain number of random independent events occur within a period of time (or distance or area etc.) when the average rate of occurrence is known.\r\n\r\nExamples of events described by a Poisson distribution distribution are:\r\n\r\n \tthe number of people who enter a shop every hour\r\n \tthe number of flaws in a sheet of glass\r\n \tthe numbers of cars that pass on a stretch of road over a certain time period\r\n \tthe number of telephone calls a call center receives per minute\r\n \tthe number of errors that occur in a system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinition\r\nThe Poisson distribution is defined by:\r\n\r\n\\[ Pr(X=x)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{x}}{x!} \\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the mean or expected number of occurrences per unit time, distance, area or volume.\r\n\r\nThe graph below shows how the Poisson distribution varies with \\(\\lambda\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\nLet us suppose that over the past years, on average, 3 soldiers were kicked to death by horses.

As a general rule both \\(np\\) and \\(nq\\) should be greater than or equal to \\(5\\) in order to use the normal approximation.\r\n\r\nBut, what if \\(p\\) is not close to \\(0.5\\)? If \\(p\\) is small \\((&lt;0.05)\\) and \\(n\\) is large, then we can use the Poisson distribution to approximate the binomial distribution, where the parameter, \\(\\lambda=np\\).\r\n\r\nExample\r\nA sample of 50 people is chosen from a population in which 1% suffer from schizophrenia.

The title of the work is ambiguous and could infer an inability within a society to care appropriately for those it holds in its care.  A poor hospital may imply something about a failure to feel for the plight of others, or the capacity of hospital staff or residents to endure, due to financial or political factors, or, if we consider the world currently, a pandemic. A poor hospital may be a place of uncertainty due to an incapacity to provide refuge or guidance, rather than being an institution capable of promoting well-being. A poor hospital may be a piteous reflection about an infirmary overtaken by sickness, or an institution that has failed its capabilities. [\/hl]\r\n\t[\/highlight-text]\r\n\t[highlight-text]\r\n\t\t[hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the content \u2013 description of the work.\"]In the centre of the work, a group of figures converges, comprising three nurses and two shadowy figures. We enter the picture, closely following a nurse as she pushes a wheelchair into the ward, towards a trolley that is being made ready. A shadowy character stands at the centre, his identity hidden by the mask brushed across his face, and although indeterminate, this figure implies a patriarchal presence. The intention of the nurse who stares directly at us is ambiguous: perhaps we are related to the incoming patient, or we\u2019re part of the medical staff, or perhaps we are merely the viewer of the painting. The patient and their bed devolve into swipes of paint, their status, and even their very existence, reduced to the intrinsic structure of the painting itself. The blood-red streaks, depicting blankets and a nurse\u2019s sash, are a sanguine reminder of our mortal fragility.[\/hl]\r\n \t[\/highlight-text]\r\n\t[highlight-text]\r\n\t\t[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, thisis the rationale - artist intent for the audiences\"]The nurse that stares directly at the onlooker casts an enigmatic gaze. The gaze, and the nurse\u2019s intention are not clear. We consider that she may be seeking our aid, revoking us for our role as ineffectual observers, or may equally be standing defiant, rejecting our assumptions. Nevertheless, the nurse appears to provide a \u2018draw\u2019 for the viewer as they become self-aware through the subconscious repetition of being seen and looked at: the viewer becomes conscious of the gaze, the pattern of being aware of equally being a visual object. (Lacan 1977, pp. 77-79). The nurse\u2019s gaze locks us into a silent dialogue, and we suspect that this may be our hospital, that we have somehow permitted its impoverishment.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\nReference: Lacan, J.

There are models and additional resources to help you draft your statement, and there is a short tutorial outlining the essentials of the artist biography.\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tpfNkBFjuNY\"][transcript]\r\nWriting a artist statement and biography\r\n\r\nSlide 1: Introduction\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: Introduction: Artist statement\r\nDevelop\r\nA page with the title: Professional document: reflecting on these questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is your approach to design?\r\nWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\nHow do you work?\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\nWho inspired you?\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: The skills you learn in this tutorial will help you in your professional life. Where you might use these statements as a whole, or you may take parts of it to use separately.\r\n\r\nAn artist statement is a important professional document that reflects on these following five questions: \r\n\r\nWhat is your approach to design?\r\nWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\nHow do you work?\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\nWho inspired you?\r\n\r\n\r\nSlide 2: Overview\r\nSlide description: \r\nSlide title: 1. Mind mapping\r\nA three-step process is mapped out in three blocks; in-between them are arrows pointing in the right direction. Demonstrating a step-by-step approach when developing a mind-map.\r\n\r\nBrainstorm: Ideas and words around the reflective questions and free write\r\nOrganise: Your brainstorm into order under each question to identify topics\r\nOrder: The topics and then individual points in your mind map\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: To develop your artist statement the following steps to a mind map are useful and will help you find suitable words and ideas. The first step is to brainstorm to generate ideas. Next you need to organise the ideas into categories and finally develop your ideas into a map or plan.\r\n\r\nSlide 3: Brainstorm\r\nSlide description: A mind map example. The topic \u2018Me as a textile designer\u2019 is written at the center of the page. Brainstorm ideas begin to appear around the topic.\r\n\r\nNarration: At this stage all ideas are acceptable and the aim is to get as many ideas as possible ideas that could go towards writing about yourself as a textile designer.\r\n\r\nSlide 4: Organise\r\nSlide description: Building on top of the previous example. Connections are made between certain words by using different colours.\r\n\r\nNarration: Step two involves finding connections between the ideas in relation to the five reflective questions. Colour is a useful way to distinguish connections around the different questions.\r\n\r\nSlide 5: Order\r\nSlide description: A new mind-map is created with the topic \u2018Me as a textile designer\u2019 written in the center of the page. This time, the five reflective questions are written on the page:\r\n\r\nWhat is your approach to design?\r\nWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\nHow do you work?\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\nWho inspired you?\r\n\r\nThe connections that were identified from the previous mind-map are organised into these categories.\r\n\r\nNarration: The final stage is to order the ideas into groups around the questions and create a spidergram or something similiar to complete your mind map you will use this as a plan for your writing.\r\n\r\nSlide 6: Overview\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: The writing process\r\nA three-step process is mapped out in three blocks; in-between them are arrows pointing in the right direction demonstrating a step-by-step approach during the writing process. The steps are:\r\n\r\nIdentify: Themes and ideas using your mind-map\r\nBegin writing: By creating topic sentences for each of the paragraph\r\nDevelop your ideas: By structuring your paragraphs using TEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: Now, it's time to start writing your artist statement. First look at each category in your mind-map and identify the main theme or idea that answers each question. Complete the writing processes by then structuring your paragraphs based on the mind map.\r\n\r\nSlide 7: Part 1 - Identify\r\nSlide description: \r\nSlide title: Using your mind-map\r\nLook at the bigger picture of what you are trying to say and identify the overall themes or ideas.\r\nE.g. What values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\n \r\nIdeas + energy flow\r\nCollective goal\r\nEnthusiasm eg. \u2018Full Drop Collective\u2019\r\nHolistic: concept to product\r\n\r\nTheme identified from these points is collaboration.\r\n\r\nNarration: Here is an example of how you would identify one main theme from each list that will become the topic sentence for each paragraph. In this case all the ideas are about working with other people and sharing ideas, so a useful word here is collaboration. This will become the topic of your paragraph.\r\n\r\nSlide 8: Part 2 - Identify\r\nSlide description: The main themes are written under their relevant sections on the mind map.\r\n\r\nNarration: Notice how the main themes have been identified for each part of the mind map.\r\n\r\nSlide 9: Begin writing\r\nSlide description: Start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph. Use the themes you have identified for each question.\r\nFor example:\r\nQ. What beliefs and values underpin your work?\r\nStep 1: Start by directly answering the question even if it seems predictable.\r\nFor example: I believe that collaboration is the most important thing for my work.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Now change the topic to make it stronger or more interesting.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nCollaboration is key for me.\r\nCollaboration is essential to my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: To write a topic sentence for your paragraph, start by writing a direct answer to the question then you can rewrite the sentence to improve it.\r\n\r\nSlide 10: Develop your ideas\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: Paragraph writing\r\nComplete your paragraph by following the TEEL structure\r\nTEEL STRUCTURE:\r\n\r\nTOPIC: Write a topic sentence containing the main idea. This is your voice and your idea\r\nEXPLANATION: Write one or more sentences that explain or elaborate on the main idea. This shows your reflection and analysis of the topic.\r\nEVIDENCE: Illustrate using examples from your own work and your experience, references to other artists and designers you admire and from your knowledge of history and theory.\r\nLINK: sum up by referring back to the main idea\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: Now you can use the rest of the information from the mind map to complete the paragraph by writing supporting sentences that explain and give examples. The TEEL structure is a very helpful framework for structuring your paragraphs and making sure that you cover everything that is important.\r\n\r\nSlide 11: Begin writing\r\nSlide description: Visual representation of the narration: a hamburger animated in layers:\r\n\r\nTop bun = topic sentence.\r\nTomato and cheese = explanation. \r\nMeat and lettuce = evidence and examples.\r\nBottom bun = linking sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: The hamburger is a good metaphor for a paragraph. Notice how the bread roll which is the topic sentence at the beginning and the linking sentence at the end hold the ingredients together because without it you don't have a hamburger!\r\n\r\nSlide 12: Begin writing\r\nDescription: Using the TEEL paragraph (example):\r\n\r\nTopic sentence: Collaboration is key for me.\r\nExplanation: The ideas and energy which grow when a group of like-minded individuals are moving towards a collective goal fills me with enthusiasm and makes me feel like anything is possible.\r\nEvidence: At the end of 2011, I started working as a part of Full Drop Collective, a group of six females textile designers exploring the possibilities in designer-maker goods and collaborative projects.\r\nLink: Being part of a project from start to finish and thinking about design in a holistic sense from concept to product has been important part of my practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: No Narration.\r\n\r\nSlide 14: Introduction\r\nSlide description:\r\nDevelop an artist biography with the following:\r\n\r\nAn introduction to yourself\r\nA summary of your resume\r\nYour approach to your work\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: An artist biography is an introduction to you and a summary to your resume and approach to your work.\r\n\r\nSlide 15: What is it for?\r\nSlide description:\r\n\r\nExhibition proposals \/ galleries \/ curators\r\nWebsites\r\nCatalogues prefacing your images\r\nIndustry \/ potential employers\r\nRecruitment agencies\r\nPublications of an kind \/ media.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration: Your artist biography needs to be redesigned for each audience. Here are some examples of where your biography would be used.\r\n\r\nSlide 16: What is in it?\r\nSlide description: A pyramid diagram (base at the top then narrowing down), broken down into four different sections. This is a representation of importance.\r\nArtist name and work\r\n\r\nMaterials and techniques that are employed by the artist\r\nInfluences on your work\r\n\r\nBrief history\r\n\r\nEducation, training\r\n\r\nProfessional experience\r\n\r\nExperience in your field eg. Projects, commissions, own businesses\r\n\r\nPhilosophy \/ ethos\r\n\r\nShort description of what the artist would like to accomplish with their art\r\n\r\n\r\nNarration : The artist biography is structured with the most important point at the beginning, which is who the artist is and their name. Followed by a brief history experience and summary of their philosophy.\r\n\r\nSlide 17: Example: Artist biography?\r\nSlide description:\r\nArtist biography (example):\r\n[Artist name and work] Tania Swinn is a textile designer who creates softly textured fabrics in vibrant colours. Her work features botanical inspired designs using recycled materials. [Brief history]Born and raised in Tasmania, Tania received her Bachelor in Textile Design from RMIT. [Professional history] She has exhibited widely in Australia and recently worked on projects with DESSI. [Ethos\/philosophy] She is currently completing a placement with Ilke. The emphasis is on the quality of workmanship and the respect for sustainability.\r\n\r\nNarration: No Narration.\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nVocabulary tips\r\nHere are some vocabulary tips to help you through your writing process.\r\nVocabulary do's\r\n[ll-grid]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DO use active verbs\"]They make your text more concise and engaging. Active or Action verbs are more persuasive and easier for your reader to understand.For example: a sentence with the verb 'to do' in the active voice would be, 'I will do my shopping on Wednesday.' Instead of a passive voice, 'On Wednesday, the shopping will be done by me.'\t[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DO use the present tense\"] Your statement is about what you're creating now, not your past. The present tense makes your work seem current and your writing more engaging.[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DO use the first person if you want to\"]  You don't have to write in the third person. It's OK to say \"I\" and \"me\" in your statement \u2013 it can be a more direct way of talking to your audience.[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DO use language that your audience can understand.\"] Using clear and simple language makes your work more readable, and this is what readers prefer. You do not need to try to impress audiences with big words and complicated sentences.[\/ll-card]\r\n[\/ll-grid]\r\nVocabulary don'ts\r\n[ll-grid]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DON'T use long sentences or paragraphs\"] Break it up into smaller parts. This will help your audience to engage with your writing and make it easier for them to follow the ideas and themes of your work.[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DON'T use art speak\"] Try to avoid using pretentious or obscure language when discussing your work. Aim to reach the widest possible audience with your writing- including people who are not art professionals.[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DON'T be dishonest\"] Do not brag or make false claims about your work \u2013 be honest. Do not try to inject meaning into your work that does not really exist.[\/ll-card]\r\n\t[ll-card title=\"DON'T use hyperbole\"] Avoid using overstatement such as describing your work as \"a ground-breaking technique\". Let the person viewing your work decide whether or not it is groundbreaking. Also, avoid clich\u00e9s (overused phrases) such as \"my work challenges the viewer\u2026\"[\/ll-card]\r\n[\/ll-grid]\r\n","excerpt":"Writing an artist statement has several stages.

Determine how many electrons an aluminium atom has to lose or gain to obtain a noble gas electron configuration.\r\nAnswer\r\nThe purpose of losing or gaining an electron is to acquire an octet in the valence shell. \\(\\ce{Al}\\)'s electron configuration is \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{1}\\). The valence shell contains three electrons. \\(\\ce{Al}\\) can obtain the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ne}\\), which is the noble gas just before \\(\\ce{Al}\\), by losing those three electrons, . The \\(\\ce{Al}\\) atom has \\(13\\) electrons and \\(13\\) protons in the neutral state. When it loses three electrons, \\(\\ce{Al}\\) has three excess protons giving rise to a cation, \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\). \\[ \\ce{Al}^{3+}\\;1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}=\\left[\\ce{Ne}\\right] \\]\r\n\r\n2. The neutral \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom has eight electrons and eights protons. Explain how \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom acquires valence shell octet.\r\nAnswer\r\nThe electron configuration of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4}\\). The valence shell has four electrons. It can achieve an octet and stable noble gas electron configuration by gaining two electrons into a \\(2p\\) orbital. Therefore, \\(\\ce{O}\\) produces \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\) ion, which has two excess electrons. \\[ \\ce{O}^{2-}\\;1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}=\\left[\\ce{Ne}\\right] \\]\r\n\r\n3. Determine the chemical formula of the compound produced when \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\) ions interact.\r\nAnswer\r\nThere are two ways of writing chemical formulas.\r\nMethod 1:\r\nFirst, write down the symbol of the cation with its charge followed by the anion.\r\n\\[ \\ce{Ca}^{2+} \\] \\[ \\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\ce{F}^{-} \\] Next, cross each ions charge (only the numerical value, not the sign) and write it down as subscripts. So, calcium ion's charge will be written next to fluoride ion, and fluoride ion's charge will be written next to calcium ion, in both cases as subscripts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod 2:\r\n\\(\\ce{Ca}\\) ion has a \\(+2\\) charge, and \\(\\ce{F}\\) ion has a \\(-1\\) charge. Two \\(\\ce{F}\\) ions, each with \\(-1\\) charge, will neutralise the \\(+2\\) charge of \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) ion. Therefore, the chemical formula is \\[ \\ce{CaF2} \\]\r\n\r\n4. Write the chemical formula for a compound composed of \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\) and \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\).\r\nAnswer\r\nFirst, write down the symbol of the cation followed by the anion with their charges. \\[ \\ce{Al}^{3+}\\ce{O}^{2-} \\] Next, cross over the numerical values of the charges to get the chemical formula. \\[ \\ce{Al}_{2}\\ce{O}_{3} \\]\r\n\r\n5. Write the chemical formula of the compound formed by copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) ions and sulfate ions.\r\nAnswer\r\nCopper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) ion \\(=\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\)\r\nSulfate ion \\(=\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\)\r\nCopper ion has a \\(+2\\) charge, and sulphate ion has a \\(-2\\) charge. The \\(+2\\) charge of copper ion cancels off to the \\(-2\\) charge of sulphate ion resulting in a neutral compound.\r\nSo, the chemical formula is \\(\\ce{CuSO}_{4}\\).\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\ce{Ca}\\) loses two electrons to acquire the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ar}\\). What is the chemical symbol of the ion that it forms?\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\ce{Ca}^{2-}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\ce{Ca}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\ce{Ca}^{+}\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\n\r\nb \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n \tWhen \\(\\ce{N}\\) reacts with other elements, it gains three electrons.

Keep your sentences short (15\u201320 words) by removing unnecessary words.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n \tThey are easier to read and understand.\r\n \tLonger sentences can lead to misunderstandings and confusion if read quickly.\r\n \tLong sentences make ideas less clear.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1 (27 words)\r\nA number of proposals have been received and, after much consideration weighing the pros and cons, it has been decided to award the contract to Wright Industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2 (16 words)\r\nA number of proposals have been received and we have awarded the contract to Wright Industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second sentence is easier to read. Sometimes long sentences may be necessary, however too many make it difficult for the reader to comprehend.\r\nUse clear and concise language\r\nUse simple, clear and direct language. Use strong verbs (doing\/action words) rather than noun phrases.\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1\r\nWe undertook a comparison of computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2\r\nWe compared computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth sentences have the same meaning.

Areas under the standard normal distribution curve represent probabilities which can be found via a calculator or a \u201cz-table\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe standard normal distribution (sometimes called a z-distribution) has a mean of zero (\\(\\mu=0\\)) and a standard deviation of \\(1\\ (\\sigma=1)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTables and probabilities\r\nIf we are working with the standard normal distribution we are not restricted to the 68-95-99 rule because tables are available to enable us to find proportions or percentages or probabilities for any value in the distribution. Tables come in different layouts, but this table (a portion of the table is shown below) gives the proportion to the left of a chosen z-value of up to 2 decimal places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can interpret our proportions or percentages as probabilities:\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.00\\right)=0.500\\) or \\(50\\)%.1 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.00\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.03\\right)=0.512\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.2 This corresponds to the number \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.03\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.75\\right)=0.7734\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.3 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.7\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.05\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a graphics calculator or a computer can also be used to find areas, proportions and probabilities in a normal distribution, rather than the table used here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be less than 1.28?\r\nSolution\r\nDraw a diagram as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the shaded area to the left of \\(z=1.28.\\) Using the following table we find that the area to the left is \\(0.8997\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the percentage is \\(89.97\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be more than 1.28?\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to find the percentage area shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot read areas to the right of a z-value directly from the table at the end of this module. Instead we observe that: 100% of all values lie under the curve. The area to the left of the shaded region is the same as part a). So the percentage of values to the right of \\(1.28\\) will be \\(100\\)% minus the percentage to the left of \\(1.28\\). Therefore the percentage of values more than \\(1.28\\) is \\(100\\)%\\(-\\) \\(89.97\\)% = \\(10.03\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\)?\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to find the percentage area shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot look up areas between two values directly from the table. But we know from Example 1 that 89.97% of values are less than 1.28. We also know \\(50\\)% of values lie to the left of the mean \\(\\left(z=0\\right)\\) because this is a property of our symmetrical bell curve. Therefore the percentage of values between \\(0\\) and 1.28 is \\(89.97\\)% \\(-\\) \\(50\\)% = \\(39.97\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be greater than \\(-1.28\\)?\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to find the percentage area shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot usually look up negative values in the table.4 There are some normal distribution tables that include negative z values. But we know that the bell curve is symmetrical as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area to the right of \\(-1.28\\) is the same as the area to the left of \\(1.28\\). Therefore the percentage of values greater than \\(-1.28\\) is \\(89.97\\)% from Example 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\)?\r\nSolution\r\nTo find this area we use the symmetry of the graph.\r\n\r\nObserve that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find this area we use the symmetry of the graph.\r\n\r\nObserve that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\).\r\n\r\nWe know the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28=39.97\\)% because we found it in Example 3 above.\r\n\r\nTherefore the percentage of the graph between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\) is \\(2\\times39.97\\)% \\(=79.8\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable\r\nThe proportion of the area under the curve to the left of a chosen value of z is given in the table below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(a) less than \\(1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(b) less than \\(-1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(c)between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(0\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(d) greater than \\(1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(e) between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(1.95.\\)\r\n\r\nNote that answers may vary slightly depending on whether tables or calculators are used.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer 1\"]\r\n\r\n(a) \\(97.44\\%%\\ \\quad\\) \\(\\ \\)(b) \\(2.56\\%\\ %\\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\ \\)(c) \\(47.44\\%%\\ \\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\ \\)(d) \\(2.56%\\%\\ \\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\ \\)(e) 94.88%\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what proportion of values lie between \\(-0.5\\) and \\(1.5\\)?\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer 2\"]\r\n\r\n\\(0.6247\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what proportion of values lie outside the interval \\(\\pm1.7\\)?\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer 3\"]\r\n\r\n\\(0.0892\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n \tGiven that a value in a standard normal distribution is greater than -1 what is the probability that it will be less than 2?

The mean of a normal distribution corresponds to a standardised score of \\(0\\) and we can see that \\(\\mu\\pm\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm1\\), \\(\\mu\\pm2\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm2\\) and \\(\\mu\\pm3\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm3\\).\r\n\r\n\\(z-\\)scores\r\nFor other values of the mean and standard deviation, we can use the formula \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{align*}\\] to find \\(z\\) scores (where the \\(z\\) score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean).\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a Normal Distribution with a mean of \\(1.2\\) and a standard deviation of \\(0.4\\), then to find the standardised score for \\(x=1.7\\):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(1.7-1.2)}{0.4}\\\\ &amp; =1.25 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nA score of \\(1.7\\) in the distribution with mean \\(1.2\\) and standard deviation \\(0.4\\) is equivalent to a standardised score of \\(1.25\\). Alternatively, we could say that the score \\(1.7\\) is \\(1.25\\) standard deviations above the mean for that distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculating probabilities using \\(z-\\)scores\r\nOnce we have converted the scores of our distribution into standard scores or \\(z\\)-scores we can use normal distribution tables to calculate precise percentages and probabilities.\r\n\r\nThe normal distribution is a continuous distribution, so we can find the probability that \\(x\\) is greater than or less than a particular value, but not that \\(x\\) is equal to a particular value.\r\n\r\nBecause the total area under the standardised curve is \\(1\\), \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;\\beta\\right)\\) is equivalent to the area to the left of \\(\\beta.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nIf the mean maximum temperature for Melbourne in January is \\(25.9^{\\circ}\\)C with a standard deviation of \\(2.1^{\\circ}\\) what is the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C?\r\n\r\nFirst draw a diagram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =28\\\\ z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(28-25.9)}{2.1}\\\\ &amp; =1.\\\\ \\Pr\\left(x&gt;28\\right) &amp; =\\Pr\\left(z&gt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-\\Pr\\left(z&lt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-0.8413\\ \\ \\left(0.8413\\textrm{ is from the table at end of this module}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0.1587. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C is \\(0.1587.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nThe top \\(0.5\\)% of students applying for Stato university are given full scholarships.

Let\u2019s call it \\(z_{s}.\\) Then \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(z&gt;z_{s}\\right) &amp; =0.005 \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(z&lt;z_{s}\\right) &amp; =1-0.005\\\\ &amp; =0.9950. \\end{align*}\\] Using the table at the end of this module, we look up \\(0.995\\) in the body of the table and see that the corresponding \\(z\\)- score is \\(z_{s}=2.57\\) or \\(z_{s}=2.58\\). We will take \\(z_{s}=2.58.\\)2 You could take the average of \\(2.57\\) and \\(2.58\\) in this case, that is \\(2.575\\) but two decimal places of accuracy is usually enough. Now using the formula we have \\[\\begin{align*} z_{s} &amp; =\\frac{x_{s}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\\\ 2.58 &amp; =\\frac{x_{s}-372}{40}.\\\\ \\textrm{Rearranging we have, }x_{s} &amp; =2.58\\times40+372\\\\ &amp; =475.2\\,. \\end{align*}\\] So applicants who score more than \\(475.2\\) will get a scholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable for calculating z-values\r\nThe table below gives the probability (the shaded area to the left) for a particular \\(z\\)-value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n1.

The energy of the electron shells increases with the distance from the nucleus. Therefore, the electrons closest to the nucleus have lower energy than the electrons located further away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tElectron subshells - The number of subshells in a shell is equal to the shell number. Subshells are labeled as \\(s,p,d\\) and \\(f\\). Each subshell contains a certain number of electrons. An \\(s\\) subshell contains up to \\(2\\) electrons, a \\(p\\) subshell contains up to \\(6\\) electrons, a \\(d\\) subshell contains up to \\(10\\) electrons, and a \\(f\\) subshell contains up to \\(14\\) electrons.\r\n \tElectron orbitals - An electron orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons where one must spin up and the other spin down. Therefore, an \\(s\\) subshell has one orbital, a \\(p\\) subshell has three orbitals, a \\(d\\) subshell has five orbitals and an \\(f\\) subshell has seven orbitals. Orbitals have distinct shapes, \\(s\\) orbitals are spherical, \\(p\\) orbitals are dumb-bell. Orbitals within the same subshell that have the same shape are generally of equal energy but have a different orientation in space, such as \\(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\\) (\\(x,y,z\\) denote the orientation in space).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting electron configurations\r\n\r\n \tElectron subshells are filled in order of increasing energy.

Metals are located on the left side of the periodic table, and nonmetals are located on the right. Physical properties of metals - conductors of electricity and heat, exist as solids at room temperature (except Mercury), ductile, malleable, shiny appearance (metallic lustre), high density and high melting point. Elements know as metalloids exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties. Metalloids are located between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table.   s,p,d,f blocks The elements in the periodic table are categorised into \\(s,p,d,f\\) blocks based on the location of the last electron. The \\(s\\) block contains elements that have their last electron in \\(s\\) subshell. Similarly, \\(p,d,f\\) blocks have elements with their last electron located in \\(p,d,f\\) subshells, respectively.    Classification based on electron configurations of the elements  The noble gases - The last electron located in the \\(p\\) subshell except \\(\\ce{He}\\). All noble gases, except \\(\\ce{He}\\) have electron configuration ending with \\(p^{6}\\) (completes the \\(p\\) subshell). The representative elements - The elements located in \\(s\\) block and the first five columns of \\(p\\) block belongs to the representative elements group. The last electron of these elements fills an \\(s\\) subshell partially or entirely or fills a \\(p\\) subshell partially. The transition elements - The elements located in the \\(d\\) block. The inner transition elements - The elements located in the \\(f\\) block.   Classification of the periodic table based on electron configuration of the elements.   Periodic table trends  Atomic radii Atomic radii increase from the top to the bottom of a group of the periodic table. As \\(n\\) increases when proceeding down a group, valence orbitals become larger, leading to an increase in atomic radii. In contrast, from left to right of a period, atomic radii decrease. The effective nuclear charge (Z) increases when the atomic number (Z) increases across the period. As a result of the higher Z, orbitals become smaller.   Ionisation energy The first ionisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. The second and third ionisation energies are the energies necessary to remove more electrons from the atom. First ionisation energy increases when moving from left to right across a period as larger Z makes electrons bound tightly. When proceeding down on a group, the first ionisation energy decreases as an electron in a higher energy level is easier to remove. The trend in the first ionisation energy is inverse of the atomic radii.   Electron affinity Electron affinity is the amount of energy change when an electron is added to a gaseous phase atom to form an anion. The electron affinity becomes more negative when moving across a period from left to right.   Electronegativity Electronegativity is the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons. The larger the value, the larger the electron attracting ability. Atoms with higher electronegativity form anions, whereas atoms with smaller electronegativity form cations. Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom and increases from left to right of the periodic table.

This is a short movie on solving quadratic equations.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is A X squared plus B X plus C equals zero where A is not equal to one. For instance, five X squared minus three X plus nine equals zero. In this case A equals five, B equals minus three and C equals nine and if you have the equation X squared equals five X minus four you then have to rearrange it into the form A X squared plus B X plus C equals zero, in other words this becomes X squared minus five X plus four equals zero where A equals one, B equals minus five and C equals four.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Y squared equals five Y. As you can see this is not of the form A X squared plus B X plus C equals zero, so rearrange it to make it look like that, Y squared minus five Y equals zero. Notice that this will factorise into Y brackets Y minus five. Then we have the form M times N equals zero, Y times Y minus five equals zero, so we can use the null factor law where Y equals zero or Y minus five equals zero, from which Y equals zero or Y equals five. Notice when you get your answers it\u2019s a good idea to check that when substituting Y equals zero and Y equals five back into the original Y squared equals five Y that you get the left hand side equal to the right hand side. Do this for yourself.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at this example, X squared minus five X plus four equals zero. Note how it\u2019s different to example one, there\u2019s a trinomial here, X squared term and X term and a number term, a constant. That will factorise into X minus four X minus one, again we have our null factor law X minus four times X minus one, so using that law we get X minus four equals zero or X minus one equals zero from which X equals four or X equals one. It\u2019s always a good idea to check to see that the answers are correct by substituting back into the original equation. You can do this for yourself.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at another trinomial, P square plus 10 P plus 25 equals zero. This will factorise into P plus five P plus five. Notice it\u2019s a perfect square and thus, using the null factor law, we have just one P plus five equals zero from which P equals minus five. Again, do the check to make sure the left hand side of the original equation equals the right hand side, which is zero.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another example, four M squared minus 49 equals zero. Notice that this is the difference of a perfect square, in other words it becomes two M plus seven two M minus seven equals zero. Again using the null factor law two M plus seven equals zero two M minus seven equals zero from which M equals minus seven over two or M equals plus seven over two.\r\n\r\nAnd finally here\u2019s a more complicated quadratic equation to solve. Here we\u2019re given X equals minus six over one minus two X so we have to do some rearranging first to turn it into A X square plus B X plus C equals zero, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in this second line, so we have two X squared minus X minus six equals zero which needs to be factorised and it does, into two X plus three X minus two equals zero, using the null factor law we arrive at X equals minus three over two or X equals two, so those are our solutions.\r\n\r\nNow do some problems for yourselves.

On this page, you will learn about what they are, how to write chemical formulas for ionic compounds, and much more.\r\nIons\r\nIons are produced when electrons transfer entirely from one atom to another. These are charged species. The charge of an ion depends on whether the atom gains (negatively charged or anions) or loses electrons (positively charged or cations).\r\n\r\nExamples: \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\),\\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\), \\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\), \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\), \\(\\ce{N}^{3-}\\)\r\nOctet Rule\r\nThe valence electron configuration of noble gases is considered the most stable valence electron configuration. Except for helium, all noble gases have eight electrons in their valence shell (completely filled \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) subshells). The main group metals attempt to achieve the electron configuration of the noble gas just before them in the periodic table by losing electrons. Main group nonmetals acquire the electron configuration of the noble gas just after them in the periodic table by gaining electrons.\r\n\r\nFor instance, potassium's electron configuration is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\,4s^{1}\\). Potassium loses one electron (\\(4s\\) electron) and becomes potassium cation (\\(\\ce{K}^{+}\\)) to achieve noble gas electron configuration: \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\).\r\n\r\nThe electron configuration of chlorine is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{5}\\). To achieve noble gas electron configuration, chloride gains one electron (\\(3p\\) electron) and becomes chloride anion (\\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)) : \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\). Therefore, in general, metals form cations and nonmetals form anions.\r\n\r\nWhen forming bonds, atoms attempt to achieve stable noble gas configuration by sharing, losing or gaining electrons for each of the atoms associated.\r\nNaming Monoatomic Ions\r\nMain group cations are named using the name of the element followed by ion. For instance, \\(\\ce{Li}^{+}\\): Lithium ion, \\(\\ce{Mg}^{2+}\\): Magnesium ion and \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\): Aluminium ion.\r\n\r\nTransition metals (\\(d,f\\)blocks) and some \\(p\\) block elements can form multiple cations such as \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\), \\(\\ce{Pb}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Pb}^{4+}\\). These types of cations can be named in two ways. The first is that the ion with the smaller charge ends with \"-ous\" and the larger charge ends with \"-ic\". For instance, \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)is cuprous ion and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) is cupric ion. The other is writing the charge of the ion in Roman numerals within parenthesis next to the element name. For example, \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)is Copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{I}\\right)\\) ion, and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) is Copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nAnions are named by removing the ending of the element name and replacing it with \"-ide\". For instance, the anion formed by \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) is the Chloride ion.\r\nPolyatomic Ions\r\nPolyatomic ions consist of more than one atom. For example, \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\)(sulphate), \\(\\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}\\) (nitrate), \\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\) (phosphate) and \\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\) (ammonium) ions. Atoms in polyatomic ions are held together by covalent bonds.\r\n\r\nIsoelectronic Species\r\n\r\nIsoelectronic species are atoms and ions that have an equal number of electrons. For example, \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\), \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\), \\(\\ce{Ne}\\), \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Mg^{2+}}\\). All of these species contain \\(10\\) electrons.\r\n\r\nIonic Bonds\r\n\r\nIonic bonds are created between metals and non-metals by transferring electrons from metals to non-metals. Metals provide the cation (lose electrons), and nonmetals provide the anion (gain electrons). Generally, bonds formed between atoms with larger electronegativity 1 (e.g. elements in groups 16 and 17 of the periodic table) and smaller electronegativity (e.g. elements in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table) are ionic. For instance, \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\): difference between electronegativities of \\(\\ce{Na}\\) (EN\\(=0.93\\)) and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) (EN\\(=3.16\\)) is \\(2.23\\). For an ionic compound to be formed, the difference between electronegativities of two participating atoms must be larger than or equal to two. The larger difference in electronegativity creates electrostatic interactions between the electrons of one atom and the nucleus of the other atom. 2\r\n\r\nPlay animationStop animation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIonic Compounds\r\n\r\nIonic compounds are held together by electrostatic interactions between cations and anions involved. The cations and anions are arranged in such a way that gaps between ions are filled efficiently and permit maximum electrostatic interactions. Ionic compounds are polar materials.\r\n\r\nWriting Chemical Formulas for Ionic Compounds\r\n\r\nIonic compounds are neutral species. Ions involved in an ionic compound combine in such a ratio that the net charge becomes zero. Parentheses are used to enclosed polyatomic ions when more than one polyatomic ions are involved in an ionic compound. In that case, the subscript is written outside the parentheses. For instance, \\(\\ce{Fe}_{2}\\left(\\ce{SO}_{4}\\right)_{3}\\) and \\(\\left(\\ce{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\ce{CO}_{3}\\). The chemical formula of an ionic compound displays the lowest possible ratio that ions can combine.\r\n\r\nNaming Ionic Compounds\r\n\r\n \tFirst, write the name of the cation followed by the anion's name with a space in between. For example, \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) is written as sodium chloride, \\(\\ce{MgSO4}\\) is written as magnesium sulphate.\r\n \tTransitional metals and some of the \\(p\\) block elements have more than one charge. Therefore, if the cation is from those groups, it is essential to include the charge within parentheses next to its name in Roman numerals or use \"-ous\" and \"-ic\" to indicate smaller charge and larger charge, respectively. For instance, \\(\\ce{CuSO4}\\) is written as copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) sulphate or cupric sulphate, \\(\\ce{FeCl2}\\) is written as iron\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) chloride or ferrous chloride.\r\n\r\nPhysical Properties of Ionic Compounds\r\n\r\n \tCrystalline solids\r\n \tConduct electricity in solution state\r\n \tHigh melting points and boiling points\r\n \tSoluble in polar solvents\r\n\r\n1Electronegativity is the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons.\r\n\r\n2The attraction forces between oppositely charged ions are known as electrostatic interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n const manual = new Freezeframe('.freezeme', { trigger: false }); document .querySelector('.start') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.start(); }); document .querySelector('.stop') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.stop(); }); ","excerpt":"\\[\\require{mhchem}\\] Need to learn about ions?

The process of substituting numbers for pro-numerals in an expression or formula is called substitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on substitution in algebra. Replacing a pro-numeral or variable or letter in an expression or formula with a number is called substitution. Instance, here\u2019s an expression, three P, and we want to work this out, in other words evaluate, if P equals minus five. So substituting P equals minus five into the expression, three P is the same as three times P, which is three times minus five which is minus 15.\r\n\r\nHere are two more examples. Evaluate A plus five over B, if A equals minus nine and B equals two, here you notice we have two pro-numerals A and B, so substituting A and B into the formula or, sorry, into the expression, we have minus nine plus five over two which gives us minus four over two which is minus two.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another one. We want to evaluate W squared minus two Z, if W equals minus one and Z equals five, so substituting into the expression we have minus one all squared minus two times five which gives us one minus one times minus one is one minus 10 is minus 9.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at a more complicated expression. Here we have the formula C equals five brackets F minus 32 close brackets over nine and that\u2019s the formula that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit into one in Centigrade, so here we want to convert a temperature of 100 degrees in Fahrenheit, so substituting F equals 100 into the formula we get 37.78 degrees Celsius, so again, as with the previous examples, we\u2019re just substituting the unknown, or the pro-numeral, which in this case is F, into the formula.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPro-numerals\r\nPro-numerals are letters or symbols that represent numbers in a mathematical expression or formula. In the expression \\[ \\frac{a+b}{2} \\] \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are pro-numerals. In the formula for the area of a circle1 \\(A\\) is the area, \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(\\pi\\) is a number that is approximately \\(3.14\\).  \\[ A=\\pi r^{2} \\] \\(A\\), the Greek letter \\(\\pi\\) (pronounced pi) and the letter \\(r\\) are pro-numerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstitution\r\nPutting a number into an expression or formula in place of pro-numerals is called substitution. For example if \\(a=5\\) and \\(b=3,\\) the expression \\(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) can be evaluated by substituting \\(5\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(3\\) for \\(b\\) wherever they occur. That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{a+b}{2} &amp; =\\frac{5+3}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8}{2}\\\\ &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the area of a circle with a radius \\(r=5\\,cm\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\pi r^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\pi5^{2}\\\\ &amp; =25\\pi\\\\ &amp; \\thickapprox78.54\\,cm. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nEvaluate \\(\\frac{a+5}{b}\\) if \\(a=-9\\) and \\(b=2.\\)\r\nSolution \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{a+5}{b} &amp; =\\frac{-9+5}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-4}{2}\\\\ &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nEvaluate \\(w^{2}-2z\\) if \\(w=-1\\) and \\(z=5.\\)\r\nSolution \\[\\begin{align*} w^{2}-2z &amp; =\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-1\\right)-2\\times5\\\\ &amp; =1-10\\\\ &amp; =-9. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nUse the formula \\[ C=\\frac{5\\left(F-32\\right)}{9} \\] to convert a temperature of \\(212^{\\circ}\\)Fahrenheit (F) to Centigrade (C).\r\nSolution\r\nSubstituting \\(F=212\\) into the formula gives: \\[\\begin{align*} C &amp; =\\frac{5\\left(F-32\\right)}{9}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\left(212-32\\right)}{9}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\times180}{9}\\\\ &amp; =100^{\\circ}\\ \\textrm{centigrade.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nThe current in an electrical circuit is given by \\(V=IR\\) where \\(V\\)is the voltage (in volts), \\(I\\) is the current (in amps) and \\(R\\) is the resistance (in ohms).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the resistance is \\(5\\) ohms and the current is \\(2\\) amps, what is the voltage, \\(V?\\)\r\nSolution\r\nWe have \\(r=5\\) and \\(I=2.\\)Therefore, the voltage \\[\\begin{align*} V &amp; =IR\\\\ &amp; =2\\times5\\\\ &amp; =10\\,\\textrm{volts.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nThe volume \\(V,\\) of a right circular cone with base radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\) is given by \\(V=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^{2}h.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the radius of a cone is \\(5\\,cm\\) and its height is \\(15\\:cm.\\) what is the volume of the cone?\r\nSolution\r\nIn this case \\(r=5\\) and \\(h=15\\), so the volume of the cone is \\[\\begin{align*} V &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^{2}h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\pi\\times5^{2}\\times15\\\\ &amp; \\approx392.7\\:cm^{3}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nThe formula relating distance traveled \\(s,\\) to initial speed \\(u,\\) acceleration \\(a\\) and time \\(t\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] A car traveling at a speed of \\(4\\,m\/s\\) accelerates at a rate of \\(2\\:m\/s^{2}\\) for \\(5\\,s.\\) How far does it travel during this time?\r\nSolution\r\nIn this case, \\(u=4,\\) \\(a=2\\) and \\(t=5\\).

Removing the common factors allows us to factorise algebraic expressions and write them in a simpler form. Factorisation using common factors is a basic skill in mathematics so we'll discuss that too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on finding common factors in algebra. Let\u2019s start by recalling that expansion or removing brackets is all about multiplying all the terms inside the brackets by those outside. For instance A brackets B plus C is the same as A times B plus A times C, if A brackets two Y minus four A is equal to 10 A Y minus 20 A X.\r\n\r\nFactorisation is the reverse of expansion or removing brackets. For example, here\u2019s an example, 10 A Y minus 20 A X. At this stage just look at the right hand side which are the factors, five A and brackets two Y minus four X, they are the factors, so moving from right to left, multiplying five A by the brackets will give you 10 A Y minus 20 A X. Similarly the factors for this expression are three and X minus Y and multiplying those terms will give us three X minus three Y, so to factorise an algebraic expression we look for a common factor, if there is more than one common factor we multiply them to get the highest common factor, HCF, the highest common factor is then placed before the bracket and the terms inside the brackets are found by dividing each term by the highest common factor.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do some examples to explain these four important steps. Here\u2019s an example, five Y plus 10. First of all let\u2019s look for the common factor and here the common factor of five Y and 10 is five, in other words five will divide into five Y and five will divide into 10. In other words that\u2019s the same as five times Y plus five times two, it\u2019s the same as five brackets Y plus two, so note the four steps, we factorise, the common factor is five, we place the five before the brackets and what goes after that five will be the other factor, Y plus two, which is inside the brackets.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another example, but this time we\u2019re using pro-numerals, P squared plus P. What is the common factor of P squared plus P, well it\u2019s P, P will go into P squared and P will go into P, so that\u2019s the same as P times P plus P times one which again is the same as P brackets P plus one. There are two factors P and P plus one, the common factor P, P is placed before the brackets, the P plus one is placed inside the brackets.\r\n\r\nHere is a slightly more complicated one. We\u2019re mixing numbers and pro-numerals here. What\u2019s the common factor of two A B and 12 A, well two goes into both those terms but also A does as well so the common factor is two and A, so we call that the highest common factor here, we put the two together and call them one thing, two A, same as two A times B minus two A times six, which can be written in another way, two A brackets B minus six. So to repeat, factorising, highest common factor is two A, two A before the brackets, B minus six is placed inside the brackets, which is the other factor.\r\n\r\nNow do some questions for yourself.

This is a short movie on factorisation, the difference of two squares or dots.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s first of all review our knowledge of removing brackets, X plus five X minus five in this example. And if you go down three lines we end up with an answer of X squared minus 25. Notice that is the same as X squared minus five squared, in other words what we have here is terms in brackets differ only in the sign in each bracket, on the left hand side, and the expansion on the right hand side is the difference of two terms both of which are perfect squares, eight squared and five squared. So in general we can state that the dots rule says A plus B times A minus B is the same as A squared minus B squared, so the terms in brackets on the left hand side differ only in the sign, plus or minus, in each bracket and the expansion on the right hand side is the difference of two terms, both of which are perfect squares.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at an example. Here we have X squared minus 36, and the first thing to do is to see if both these terms are perfect squares. Well they are because X squared is the same as X times X, X squared, and 36 is the same as six times six which is 36. So we can now go on and state the rule which says that X squared minus 36 is the same as X plus six X minus six, the only difference is the sign in each brackets.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at another one. Four A squared minus Y squared. The first question are each of the terms perfect squares, well they are, four A squared is the same as two A all squared or two A times two A and Y squared is the same as Y times Y, so the expression is the difference of two squared or dots. So we can use the rule which says that four A squared minus Y squared is the same as two A minus Y two A plus Y, the only difference is the sign in each brackets.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a slightly more difficult question. We have three X squared minus 48. So the first question is, is the expression a dots, well it\u2019s not because neither of those terms are perfect squares, however when we factorise this expression by taking three out of the brackets we have three brackets X squared minus 16, but notice this time that X squared minus 16 is a perfect square, X times X and 16 is four times four, in other words three X squared minus 48 is three, open up big sets of brackets in blue, then we have X squared in red minus four squared in red which gives us three brackets X plus four X minus four.\r\n\r\nNow, in this final example we have X plus two all squared minus nine. First question is are these two terms perfect squares. Well the first term must be because it\u2019s X plus two all squared, so that is. Nine is a perfect square because nine is three times three, so we now have the expression X plus two all squared minus three all squared. And the rule, that gives us X plus two plus three, notice the blue plus, minus X plus two minus three, notice the blue minus, which simplifies to X plus five brackets X minus one and that\u2019s our answer.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself.

Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. This module explains how to factorise a quadratic into two linear factors.

This is a short movie on factorising quadratics. The general form of a quadratic expression is given by A X squared plus B X plus C. Here A, B and C are constants and X is the unknown. For instance here\u2019s an expression, two X squared minus three X minus four, A is plus two, B is minus three and C is minus four. Note carefully the sign for each of the numbers.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s go back a step first and look at revision of expansion, in other words removing brackets. Here\u2019s an expression, X plus two X plus three and when you expand that you multiply each term in the first bracket by the terms in the second bracket to get an answer of X squared plus five X plus six. We\u2019ve done this in a previous movie.\r\n\r\nNow factorisation is the reverse of expansion, in other words X square plus five X plus six can be expressed to the product of two factors, X plus two and X plus three. In other words as you go from left to right in this equation we\u2019re factorising, as we go from right to left we\u2019re expanding. A few important things to notice about factorisation; first of all multiplying the first terms in each bracket gives the X squared in the expression, in other words X times X is X squared. Multiplying the last terms in each bracket gives the constant term plus six in the expression, in other words plus two times plus three is plus six. Finally the co-efficient of the X terms, in other words the middle term, is the sum of the last term in each bracket, in other words here plus two and plus three is plus five. Now we\u2019ll be using these steps to work out some of these examples that follow.\r\n\r\nSo in general for the expression A squared plus B X plus C where A is equal to one multiply two numbers to get C, we add the same two numbers to get B, in other words we insert one number into each of the brackets and secondly the order is not important, in other words the second brackets could be the first and vice versa, it doesn\u2019t matter which way around you place the brackets.\r\n\r\nSo here\u2019s our first example, X squared plus nine X plus 14. So straight away we can place two brackets, as I\u2019ve done, to the right of the equal signs. Using the rules we need two numbers that when multiplied together gives us the last term, 14, and those same two numbers that, when added, gives us the co-efficient of X, the middle term, which is nine. So we can look at 14 and one, seven and two and so on until we get those two numbers that when multiplied gives us 14 but also added gives us nine and those two numbers are seven and two, seven times two is 14, seven plus two is nine. Notice if I use 14 and one multiplying them is fine but adding them will not give us nine.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at another one; Y squared minus seven Y plus 12. Here we have a negative sign in the middle term which makes it slightly more difficult but we still use the same idea as in the previous example, in other words two numbers that multiply gives us 12, the same two numbers that when added gives us minus seven, so we can look at 12 and one, six and two, four and three. Notice when we look at those different combinations, those factors of 12, there\u2019s only one that will satisfy the two conditions and that is minus three and minus four. Notice minus three times minus four is plus 12, minus three plus minus four is minus seven, so our answer is Y minus three Y minus four.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another one. Notice the terms are separated by negative signs, P squared minus five P minus 14. Again, using the rules, multiplying the two you must get minus 14, adding the two numbers we must get minus five. Here it\u2019s not so difficult because we only have 14 and one, that gives us 14, but 14 and one there\u2019s no way in which, when adding those two numbers, whether they be negative or positive, will give us minus five, so the solution to this is P minus seven and P plus two. Be extra careful with the negative signs here, notice that minus seven times plus two gives us minus 14 and minus seven plus two is minus five.\r\n\r\nAnd finally here\u2019s another one; A squared plus six A minus seven. We need two numbers that multiply to give minus seven and two numbers that add to give plus six. So we don\u2019t have much choice here, the only factors we have of seven are seven and one, so they must be seven and one, but the difficult problem here is to work out where the negative signs go and this usually comes just with trial and error, in other words A plus seven A minus one, seven times minus one is minus seven, plus seven minus one is plus six. If you tried minus seven and plus one you would notice you would not get plus six A, so try the different methods to make sure you\u2019re correct.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basic rule is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo factorise \\(x^{2}+bx+c\\), find two numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+bx+c &amp; =\\left(x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\times n=c\\) and \\(m+n=b.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that order of the factors does not matter.

So \\[\\begin{align*} p^{2}-5x-14 &amp; =\\left(p+2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nFactorise \\(a^{2}+6a-7\\).\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to write \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}+6a-7 &amp; =\\left(a+m\\right)\\left(a+n\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where according to the rule above, \\[\\begin{align*} m\\times n &amp; =-7\\ \\text{and }\\\\ m+n &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe factors of \\(-7\\) are\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 1.\\ m &amp; =1 &amp; 2.\\ m &amp; =-1\\\\ n &amp; =-7 &amp; n &amp; =7 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nOf these, only the factors in \\(2\\) satisfy the requirement that \\(m+n=6\\).

So it is not possible to factorise the expression \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}+3a+6 &amp; . \\end{align*}\\] In this case we say there are no real factors.1 Geometrically this means that the graph of \\(y=a^{2}+3a+6\\) does not touch or intersect the \\(a-\\text{axis$.$ }\\) There are complex factors but these are not dealt with in this module. It is important to understand when this occurs and is discussed in a later section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactorisation when \\(a\\neq1\\)\r\nIn this section we deal with factorisation of expressions of the form \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(a\\neq1.\\)\r\n\r\nExpressions of the type \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\) can be factorised using a technique similar to that used for expressions of the type \\(x^{2}+bx+c.\\)\r\n\r\nIn this case the coefficient of \\(x\\), in at least one bracket, will not equal 1.\r\n\r\nConsider the following product.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} (3x+2)(2x+1) &amp; =(3x)(2x)+(3x)(1)+(2)(2x)+(2)(1)\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+3x+4x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+7x+2. \\end{align*}\\] Note that\r\n\r\n \tmultiplying the first term in each bracket gives the \\(x^{2}\\) term. In this case \\(6x^{2}.\\)\r\n \tmultiplying the last term in each bracket gives the constant term, in this case \\(2.\\)\r\n \tthe coefficient of the \\(x-\\)term is the sum of the \\(x\\) terms in the expansion. In this case \\(3x+4x=7x.\\)\r\n\r\nWe can use these ideas to factorise expressions like \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\).\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nFactorise \\(2x^{2}+7x+6\\).\r\nSolution\r\nThe only factors of the coefficient of the \\(x^{2}\\) term are \\(2\\) and 1. So we are looking for a factorisation like \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}+7x+6 &amp; =\\left(2x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right)\\text{}\\\\ &amp; =2x^{2}+2nx+mx+nm\\\\ &amp; =2x^{2}+\\left(2n+m\\right)x+nm \\end{align*}\\] where \\(mn=6\\) and \\(2n+m=7.\\) We have the following possibilities:2 Note that negative factors like \\(m=-6,\\,n=-1\\) and \\(m=-1,\\,n=-6\\) don\u2019t need to be considered as they don\u2019t satisfy condition \\(2n+m=7\\).\r\n\r\n \t\\(m=3,\\ \\:n=2\\)\r\n \t\\(m=2,\\ \\ n=3\\)\r\n \t\\(m=6,\\ \\:n=1\\)\r\n\r\nOf these possibilities, the only one that satisfies \\(2n+m=7\\) is number \\(1.\\) That is \\(m=2\\text{ and }n=2\\), so \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}+7x+6 &amp; =\\left(2x+3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 7\r\nFactorise \\(2x^{2}-10x+12.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nAt first this looks like a case where \\(a=2\\) but a factor of \\(2\\) can be taken out to get: 3 You should always check if there is a number that divides into all terms of the quadratic.  \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+12 &amp; =2\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now we can use the methods in Examples \\(1-4\\) above to get\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+12 &amp; =2\\left(x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(mn=6\\) and \\(m+n=-5.\\) This implies \\(m=-2\\) and \\(n=-3\\) and so: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+12 &amp; =2\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-3\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 8\r\nFactorise \\(6x^{2}+13x-8\\).\r\nSolution\r\nIn this case there are no numbers that divide into each term as we had in Example 7 above. The coefficient of the \\(x^{2}\\) term is \\(6\\) which has factors \\[\\begin{align*} 6 &amp; =6\\times1\\\\ &amp; =2\\times3. \\end{align*}\\] So we are looking for a factorisation such as: \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(6x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+6xn+mx-8\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+\\left(6n+m\\right)x-8 &amp; \\left(8.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(3x+m\\right)\\left(2x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+3xn+2mx-8\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+\\left(3n+2m\\right)x-8 &amp; \\left(8.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] In both cases, \\(mn=-8.\\) So we have the possibilities \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =-8 &amp; n &amp; =1\\\\ m &amp; =8 &amp; n &amp; =-1\\\\ m &amp; =4 &amp; n &amp; =-2\\\\ m &amp; =-4 &amp; n &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor eqn \\(\\left(8.1\\right)\\) we know that \\(6n+m=13\\). This is not satisfied by any of the \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) values above.\r\n\r\nFor eqn \\(\\left(8.2\\right)\\) we know that \\(3n+2m=13\\). This is satisfied by \\(m=8\\) and \\(n=-1\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(3x+8\\right)\\left(2x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 9\r\nFactorise \\(4x^{2}+4x+1\\)\r\nSolution\r\nIn this case there are no numbers that divide into each term as we had in Example 7 above. The coefficient of the \\(x^{2}\\) term is \\(4\\) which has factors \\[\\begin{align*} 4 &amp; =4\\times1\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSo we are looking for a factorisation such as: \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(4x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+4xn+mx+mn\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+\\left(4n+m\\right)x+1 &amp; \\left(9.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x+m\\right)\\left(2x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+2xn+2mx+mn\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+\\left(2n+2m\\right)x+1 &amp; \\left(9.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(mn=1\\). That means \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =1 &amp; n= &amp; 1 &amp; \\left(9.3\\right)\\\\ m &amp; =-1 &amp; n= &amp; -1. &amp; \\left(9.4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Suppose eqn \\(\\left(9.1\\right)\\) is correct then \\(\\left(4n+m\\right)=4.\\) But this is not possible with the choices for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in \\(\\left(9.3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(9.4\\right)\\). Hence the factorisation must be as in eqn \\(\\left(9.2\\right)\\) with \\(2n+2m=4.\\) The latter is achieved with \\(\\left(9.3\\right)\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x+1\\right)\\left(2x+1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe approach given in examples 6-9 is okay provided there are not too many factors for \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). If the number of factors is excessive, we can employ other methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen can you get real linear factors for a quadratic?\r\nIn Example 5 above we found that we could not get real linear factors for \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}+3a+6 &amp; . \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis raises the question of when real solutions to general quadratics may be found.

This is another factorisation movie. This one is on completing the square.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s first look at X plus B all squared, which is the same as X squared plus two B X plus B squared, or putting it around the other way, X squared plus two B X plus B squared is the same as X plus B all squared. Notice the term B is half of the co\u2011efficient of X, the middle term. In other words X plus B all squared is called a perfect square. So as an example, X squared minus 24 X plus 144, look at the middle term which is minus 24 X, half of that is minus 12 and thus that is our perfect square. So knowing how to find a perfect square is very important when completing the square.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do an example. Factorise X squared plus eight X minus nine. Step one, half the co-efficient of X, in other words half of eight is four, then we square the result, four squared is 16. Step three, add and subtract 16, in other words X square plus eight X plus 16 is our perfect square, then we subtract the 16 minus nine, notice that expression there is the same as the original expression, eight square plus eight X minus nine. Step four, complete the square and simplify. In other words eight square plus eight X plus 16 is X plus four all squared minus 16 minus nine is minus 25 and then finally factorise using the difference of two squares, which is X plus four plus five brackets X plus four minus five, which is the same as X plus four X minus one.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do another one. X squared minus six X minus four. Step one, half the co\u2011efficient of X which is half of six is three, square the result, three squared is nine. Step three, add and subtract nine, that gives us X squared minus six X plus nine, there\u2019s our perfect square, then we have to subtract nine to make sure that we have the original X squared minus six X minus four. Step four, complete the square and simplify, in other words, X squared minus six X plus nine is X minus three all squared minus nine minus four is minus 13 and then finally factorise using the difference of two squares, which is X minus three plus root 13, X minus three minus root 13.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a slightly harder problem. Notice here we\u2019re factorising two X squared minus 10 X plus two. We can only complete the square if the co-efficient of X squared is one, so the first step we have to do is to remove the factor of two, thus we have two brackets X squared minus five X plus one. Now we go through the same process as before, half the co-efficient of X, but here the co-efficient of X is now five, so that half of that is five over two, square the result, five over two squared is 25 over four, then we add and subtract 25 over four which gives us that expression. Continuing on from the previous slide we have that expression, now we need to take the difference of two squares which gives us two brackets X minus five over two all squared minus 21 over four, but that can be simplified into the final expression two brackets X minus five over two plus root 21 over two brackets X minus five over two minus root 21 over two.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\nA perfect square is of the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}-2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nConsider, the expression \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx. \\end{align*}\\] To make this a perfect square, according to eqn \\(\\left(1\\right),\\) you have to add \\(b^{2}\\). But if you add \\(b^{2}\\) you must also take it away to preserve equality. That is, given \\(x^{2}+2bx\\) we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}-b^{2}. &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that the amount we added and subtracted is one half of the \\(x\\) coefficient squared. That is,\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left(\\frac{2b}{2}\\right)^{2} &amp; =b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIf you look at the right hand side of eqn \\(\\left(3\\right)\\)we have added \\(b^{2}-b^{2}=0\\) so the value is unchanged. However we can now group the terms to get:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}\\right)-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Using eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above the term in brackets on the right hand side is \\(\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}\\)and so using the difference of two squares formula (DOTS) 1 The difference of two squares formula states that \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}-b^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Note that the order of the factors on the right hand side does not matter.  \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}-b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+b-b\\right)\\left(x+b+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =x\\left(x+2b\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAt first this might seem like a lot of work for very little gain. After all, it is pretty obvious that \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =x\\left(x+2b\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the square\r\nThe advantage of completing the square comes in when we have to factorise something like \\(x^{2}+2bx+c\\) where \\(c\\) is a real number. In order to do this we follow the above procedure and the results are magical! The following examples illustrate this.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFactorise \\(x^{2}+8x-5\\) by completing the square.\r\nSolution\r\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it. We then add and subtract it from the right hand side to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+8x-5 &amp; =x^{2}+8x-5+\\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^{2}\\quad\\text{(add the square of half the $x\\text{ coefficient and subtract it)}$ }\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+8x-5+\\left(4\\right)^{2}-\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+8x+\\left(4\\right)^{2}-5-\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\ (\\text{regroup the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+8x+\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\right)-5-16\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4\\right)^{2}-21\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{21}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where, in the last line, we used the DOTS rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nFactorise \\(x^{2}-6x-4\\) by completing the square.\r\nSolution\r\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it. We then add and subtract this from the right hand side to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-6x-4 &amp; =x^{2}-6x-4+\\left(-3\\right)^{2}-\\left(-3\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}-6x-4+9-9\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}-6x+9-4-9\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)^{2}-13\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(2\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{13}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3+\\sqrt{13}\\right)\\left(x-3-\\sqrt{13}\\right)\\ \\text{using DOTS rule.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nFactorise \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) by completing the square.\r\nSolution\r\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it. We then add and subtract this from the right hand side to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+5x+9 &amp; =x^{2}+5x+9+\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+5x+\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+9-\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+9-\\frac{25}{4}\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{11}{4}. \\end{align*}\\] We are in trouble here. We cannot apply the DOTS rule because we have the SUM of two squares not the DIFFERENCE. So in this case the quadratic \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not have any real factors and solutions. Complex factors and solutions do exist but are not considered in this module.2 Geometrically this means that the graph of \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not intersect the \\(x-\\) axis. The graph is shown below\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 1 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the square when the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is not one\r\nIn this section we consider the completing the square method on quadratics of the form \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\) where \\(a\\neq1.\\) In this case we simply divide the quadratic by \\(a\\) and proceed as above. That is we write\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =a\\left[x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and complete the square on the RHS term in the square brackets. Don\u2019t forget to include the \\(a\\) in the final result!\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nFactorise \\(2x^{2}-10x+2\\).\r\nSolution\r\nDivide the quadratic by \\(2\\) and write \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-\\frac{10}{2}x+\\frac{2}{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now complete the square on the quadratic in square brackets on the RHS, \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\quad\\text{(add the square of half the $x\\text{ coefficient and subtract it)}$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+\\frac{25}{4}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ (\\text{regrouping the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{21}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\right]\\ \\text{using DOTS rule}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 2 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the square and the quadratic formula\r\nThis section is beyond the intent of this module and may be skipped if you are not interested.\r\n\r\nYou may be aware of the quadratic formula. It gives the solutions of the quadratic equation: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and is usually written as \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] The quadratic formula is established by completing the square on eqn \\(\\left(4\\right)\\). To see this, we write \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =ax^{2}+bx+c\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}\\ \\text{assuming $a\\neq0$ }\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}+\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{c}{a}-\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}\\ (\\text{regrouping the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{c}{a}-\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{c}{a}-\\frac{b^{2}}{4a^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{4ac-b^{2}}{4a^{2}}\\\\ \\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2} &amp; =-\\left(\\frac{4ac-b^{2}}{4a^{2}}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}\\\\ x+\\frac{b}{2a} &amp; =\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}\\\\ &amp; =\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\\\ x &amp; =-\\frac{b}{2a}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\,, \\end{align*}\\] and so establishes the quadratic formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nFactorise by completing the square (if possible).\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\,x^{2}+6x-5\\qquad\\text{b)$\\,x^{2}+4x+2\\qquad\\text{c)$\\,a^{2}-8a-2\\qquad\\text{d)$\\,x^{2}+6x+10$ }$ }$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{e)$\\,x^{2}-5x+5\\qquad\\text{f)$\\,y^{2}+3y+4\\qquad\\text{g)$\\,a^{2}-5a-1.$ }$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\,\\left(x+3+\\sqrt{14}\\right)\\left(x+3-\\sqrt{14}\\right)\\qquad\\text{b)$\\,\\left(x+2+\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(x+2-\\sqrt{2}\\right)$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{c)$\\,\\left(a-4+3\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(a-4-3\\sqrt{2}\\right)$ $\\qquad\\text{d) No real factors}$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{e)$\\,\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\\qquad\\text{f)$\\,\\text{No real factors.}$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{g)$\\,\\left(a-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{2}\\right)\\left(a-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{2}\\right)$ }\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nFactorise by completing the square (if possible).\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\,4x^{2}+8x-20\\qquad\\text{b)$\\,x^{2}-6x+2\\qquad\\text{c)$\\,12-4x-2x^{2}$ }$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\,4\\left(x+1+\\sqrt{6}\\right)\\left(x+1-\\sqrt{6}\\right)$ }\\qquad\\text{b)$\\,\\left(x-3+\\sqrt{7}\\right)\\left(x-3-\\sqrt{7}\\right)$ }\\qquad\\text{c)$\\,-2\\left(x+1+\\sqrt{7}\\right)\\left(x+1-\\sqrt{7}\\right)$ }\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, A3.5 Factorisation: Completing the Square (PDF 179 KB) \r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Quadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\).

When we plug in our values of x as they approach one from the right or above, the values of fx approach as you can see, two. So as x approaches one from above, x2 plus one approaches two.\r\n\r\nSo in both cases, below one and above one, as x approaches one the value of x2 plus one approaches two. So we say more formally that the limit of x2 plus one as x approaches one is equal to two.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s investigate the limit of a more complicated function. Here the function fx is equal to x2minus one divided by x minus one, again as it approaches x equals one. Let\u2019s investigate this function more closely. Notice that if we let x equals one, the denominator of this function will be zero. In other words, it\u2019s not defined at x equals one. We say it is not continuous at x equals one. If we restrict our function to all values except for x is equal to one, we can now progress and factorise this function, x2 minus x becomes x brackets x minus one. Notice that we can cancel terms top and bottom. In other words, the function fx is equal to x.\r\n\r\nSo sketching the function fx equals x as you would expect, we have a straight line for all values except for x equals one, and this is the point at which we will be investigating the limit. In other words, f of one does not exist, but as x approaches one, the value of f of x approaches one as well. So more formally since f of x if equal to x, then the limit of x2 minus x over x minus one as x approaches one is equal to one.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself.

This is a short movie on differentiation from first principles.\r\n\r\nThe process of finding the derivative f-x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of f, of x plus h, minus f of x, divided by h, is called differentiation from first principles. Just be aware that f-x is the same as dydx.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at an example. We want to differentiate f of x as equal to s\u00b2 minus x from first principles. Notice in the formula that we have three terms to investigate. We have the f of x plus h term, the f of x term, and the h term. So let\u2019s start with the f of x plus h term first. Knowing f of x is equal to x\u00b2 minus x what we do is we substitute x plus h wherever we see x. In other words, x\u00b2 becomes x plus h all squared, and x becomes x plus h. So we have x plus h all squared, minus x plus h, which on expansion gives u x\u00b2 plus 2xh, plus h\u00b2 minus x minus h.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at the fx term. Well we already know that f of x is equal to s\u00b2 minus x, so we can simply leave this expression alone. In other words, s\u00b2 minus x is x\u00b2 minus x. So, let\u2019s substitute f of x plus h and f of x into the numerator of the formula at the top of the slide, and we get this. Notice on removing the brackets the negative sign at the end of the line two becomes a plus x in line three. Notice also that the x\u00b2 terms disappear and the h terms cancel out. So we\u2019re left with 2xh plus h\u00b2 minus h. So let\u2019s now return to the formula and substitute. We have in our numerator 2xh plus h\u00b2 minus h.\r\n\r\nNotice also that the numerator factorises, so we can take h out, giving h brackets 2x plus h minus one. Notice also that there\u2019s an h on the bottom of this fraction, so the h\u2019s cancel, leaving us the bottom line f-x is equal to the limit as h approaches zero of 2x plus h minus one.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at the h approaches zero part of our formula. And what that means is that as h approaches zero, the value of h gets smaller and smaller and smaller. So working your way down the slide notice h gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it approaches zero. So we\u2019re left with f-x is equal to 2x minus one.\r\n\r\nSo, to conclude, the derivative of fx is equal to a\u00b2 minus x using first principles is f-x equals 2x minus one.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself.

This is a short calculus movie on the chain rule. The chain rule is used to differentiate a function which is the composition of two simpler functions, in other words if Y equals G U where U equals H X then D Y D X is D Y D U times D U D X.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s differentiate this function; Y equals two X minus one or to the power of four. So we let U equals two X minus one, then Y equals U to the power of four, differentiating, D U D X equals two, D Y D U equals four U cubed, substituting into the chain rule we have four U cubed times two which gives us eight U cubed and substituting back for U we get an answer of eight brackets two X minus one or to the power of three.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at a trig function; Y equals sign to the five X, so we let U equal five X giving us Y equal sign U, differentiating D U D X is five, D Y D U is cos of U and substituting into the chain rule we get cos U times five which is five cos of five X, again substituting back for U which is, in this case, is five X.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at a more complicated function here. We have Y equals one over the cubed root of 5 T square plus two T plus one, notice first of all that we\u2019ve changed the variable here, instead of D Y D S we\u2019ve got D Y D T, it doesn\u2019t matter we can still use the same process as before. First of all always changed cube roots, square roots and so on into index form to make the differentiation easier, using our substitution, differentiating D U D T, D Y D U, and now using the chain rule which in this case D Y D T equals D Y D U times D U D T and substituting we get that, which gives us, after simplifying that answer.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another trig function but note first of all that instead of Y and D Y D X we\u2019ve got F X and F dash X. First of all recall that if Y equals cos cubed X that\u2019s the same as cos of X or to the power of three. Using our substitution Y equals U cubed where U equals cos of X, now we differentiate, D Y D U equals three U squared, D U D X equals minus sign of X. Notice I\u2019ve moved back from F X and F dash X to Y and D Y D X. Now let\u2019s do the chain rule, substituting and substituting back for U we get an answer of minus three sign X cos squared X. Note that the chain rule can be extended to three or more functions. Up to now we\u2019ve been looking at two functions.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of a three function problem; Y equals log of four X or to the power of three, the three here are Y equals U cubed, U equals log of V and V is equal to four X, differentiating the three, D Y D U is three U squared, D U D V is one over V and D V D X is four, substituting for D Y D U, D U D V and D V D X we get the following, and substituting back we get an answer of three over X brackets log of four X or to the power of two after simplifying.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself.

This is a short movie on the product rule.\r\n\r\nThe product rule is used when we want to differentiate the product of two functions. So, if f of x, is equal to u of x times v of x, then the derivative f dash x is u of x times v dash x plus u dash x times vx. This formula can be abbreviated to y dash is equal to u times v dash, plus v times u dash. Note also that f dash x and y dash mean the same thing. So lets do a couple of examples to illustrate the product rule. Here\u2019s a function, x plus 3 to the power of six multiplied by 2x minus 1. Notice here that there are two functions so we can use the product rule. So, let u equal x plus 3 to the power of 6, therefore the derivative is u dash equals 6 brackets x plus 3 to the power of five and let v equals 2x minus 1, and the derivative there is v dash equals 2. Notice I\u2019ve used the chain rule to work out u dash. Substituting in to the formula y dash equals uv dash plus vu dash I get the following four lines of working. Notice when you get down to the third line that I\u2019ve taken a factor of 2 brackets x plus 3 to the power of 5 out, and in the last line I\u2019ve simplified the expression inside the square brackets to give us an answer of 14x brackets x plus 3 all to the power of 5.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another example. Again notice that there are two functions here e to the x multiplied by sin of 2x. So, this lends itself to the product rule. So I\u2019m letting u equals e to the x, the derivative is the same e to the x and v equals sin of 2 x from which the derivative is 2 cos of 2 x using the chain rule. Substituting as before into the formula y dash equals uv dash plus vu dash I get the following three lines of working. Notice again always look for terms that will factorise and I\u2019ve done that in the last line. So my answer is y dash is equal to ex brackets 2 cos 2x plus sin of 2 x.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide.

This is a short movie on the quotient rule.\r\n\r\nThe quotient rule is used when we want to differentiate the quotient or fraction of two functions. So if f of x is equal to u of x divided by v of x then the derivative f dash x is equal to v of x times u dash x minus v dash x times u of x all divided by v of x all squared.\r\n\r\nNow that formula is rather unwieldy to remember, so its often abbreviated to y dash is equal to v u dash minus u v dash all over v squared, and as with the product rule notice that f dash x and y dash mean the same thing.\r\n\r\nSo lets do an example. Here we want to differentiate y equals 1 plus x divided by x squared minus 3. Note first of all that we have a quotient, ie, a fraction with the numerator 1 plus x and the denominator x squared minus 3. So, we substitute, we let u equals 1 plus x, the derivative u dash is 1 and the denominator v equals x squared minus 3 from which the derivate v dash is equal to 2x. There is our formula for y dash for the quotient rule and now by substituting into that formula we get the following lines of working: so the first line was substituting, the next line we remove the brackets (be careful with the minus sign, the minus 2x squared) and finally we\u2019ve simplified to get the answer in blue at the bottom of the slide (y dash equals minus x squared minus 2x minus 3 divided by bracket x squared minus 3 squared).\r\n\r\nLets do another example we want to differentiate y equals x squared divided by the log of x. Note that the log of x is the same as log of x to the base e. Again as with the previous example we have a quotient. X squared is the numerator, log of x is the denominator, so we use the quotient rule. Substituting u equals x squared, therefore u dash equals 2x and v is the log of x from which the derivative is v dash 1 over x. There is our formula for the quotient rule (y dash equals v u dash minus uv dash divided by v squared) and now substituting we get these two lines of working. Notice that when we get to the final line we need to, as before, simplify, particularly the right hand term in the numerator where one of the x\u2019s cancels top and bottom. So that\u2019s our answer (y dash equals 2x log of x minus x divided by bracket log x squared).\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide.

So we\u2019re saying what number instead of X which, when added to three, gives us seven. Well obviously the answer is four because four plus three equals seven. An equation is like a balance, the numbers on the left hand side must balance the numbers on the right hand side. But let\u2019s do this another way, let\u2019s get X by itself, in other words we\u2019re doing it mathematically. To do this we subtract the three from the left hand side to isolate the X, so now the left hand side is X plus three minus three which gives us X. Let\u2019s bring in the right hand side, but remember we have to keep the equation balanced, in other words X plus three minus three on the left hand side is equal to seven minus three on the right hand side. You see how the minus three undoes the plus three, so on the left hand side we\u2019ve got X and the right hand side we\u2019ve got four. Notice that the three has been subtracted from both sides, in other words what we do to one side we must do to the other.\r\n\r\nSo the rule is that the opposite or inverse operation to plus is minus. In other words subtracting undoes adding. Let\u2019s solve an equation using addition. So we\u2019ll start with Y minus six equals 13, so we\u2019re saying what number instead of Y which when added to minus six gives us 13. Well the answer is 19 because 19 take away six equals 13. Again notice the balancing act, 19 minus six on the left hand side is equal to 13 on the right hand side. But let\u2019s do this mathematically. Let\u2019s get Y by itself and to do this we need to add the six from the left hand side to isolate the Y, remember we had to subtract the number with the previous problem, so the left hand side is now Y minus six plus six, which gives us Y, that\u2019s the left hand side. What about the right hand side. Well what we do to one side we do to the other so Y minus six plus six is equal to 13 plus six, notice plus six undoes minus six. In other words Y is equal to 19. Notice again that the six has been added to both sides, so the rule here is that the opposite or inverse operation to minus is plus, in other words adding undoes subtracting.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s solve an equation using division. Let\u2019s look at the equation four K equals 12. Remember four K means four times K, so we\u2019re saying what number instead of K which when multiplied by four gives us 12, well three because four times three is equal to 12, so we have 12 equals 12, our balancing act again. But let\u2019s do this another more mathematical way, let\u2019s get that K by itself and to do this we divide by four on the left hand side to isolate the K. To balance this we must do the same thing on the right hand side, so here we have the left hand side which is four K divided by four, the right hand side we must divide that by four too, so it\u2019s 12 divided by four, there\u2019s the calculation where we\u2019re dividing by four and so we\u2019ve got 12 divided by four is equal to three. Notice this time I\u2019ve just checked the solution to this equation, in other words if K equals three and we substitute four K into the original equation, four times three is equal to 12. So the rule here is that the opposite or inverse operation to multiplication is division. In other words dividing undoes multiplying.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s solve an equation using multiplication. Now here we have an equation M divided by four is equal to minus five, in other words what number instead of M which when divided by four gives us minus five. This one isn\u2019t so easy to work out so we have to use the following rule, in other words let\u2019s use a little bit of mathematics. What we\u2019re doing here is multiplying both sides by four, so M over four times four over one, notice how the fours cancel, is equal to minus five times four over one, or four. In other words minus five times four is minus 20. So let\u2019s check the solution. If the answer is minus 20 then minus 20 divided by four is equal to minus five. So the rule here, for multiplication, is that the opposite or inverse operation to division is multiplication, multiplying undoes dividing.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complicated operations where we have more than one. For instance, let\u2019s look at the equation two P plus five equals seven. The unknown value P is multiplied by two and then five is added to obtain the answer of seven. To find P we undo two P plus five in the reverse order to which it was built up. In other words we subtract five first and then divide by two, which is the opposite to what we did in getting from two P plus five to seven. So let\u2019s subtract five first, two P plus five minus five equals seven minus five, which gives us two. Then let\u2019s divide by two, notice we\u2019re doing it on both sides of the equation, two times P over two equals two over two, the right hand side is now one because we cancelled the two top and bottom, so two P equals two then P equals one.\r\n\r\nSo let\u2019s look at another equation, but this time it\u2019s a division equation for starters, three X minus one divided by two is equal to one. In order to solve the equation the operations is to build up the equation must be undone in the reserve order. In other words we start by dividing by two and then we add the one. Let\u2019s look at this in more detail. Three X minus one divided by two, let\u2019s multiply both sides by two to get rid of the two on the bottom of the fraction on the left hand side so we end up with three X minus one equals two. Now let\u2019s get rid of the minus one on the left hand side, so three X minus one plus one equals two plus one, notice we\u2019re doing the same operation on both left and right hand sides of the equation. That leaves us with three X equals three here, so the final step is to remove the three on the left hand side and because we have three times X we must divide by three so three X over three equals three over three. Notice the three cancels out and we\u2019re left with X equals one.\r\n\r\nSo when we solve equations using more than one operation we first of all look at how the operation was built up, then we solve the equation by undoing it in the reverse order to which it was built up. Now go to the exercise sheet and have a go at the problems for yourself. Thank you.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\nA linear equation has one unknown variable and may be solved by transposing the equation to make the variable the subject of the equation. For example, the equation \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(2x-7\\right) &amp; =-15 \\end{align*}\\] may be transposed to get \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Transposition involves changing the equation via operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This module discusses techniques for solving linear equations by transposition.\r\n\r\nSimple equations\r\nThe essential point is that in solving an equation, what you do to one side must be done to the other side.\r\n\r\nIf you add, subtract, multiply or divide one side of the equation by a number you must do the same to the other side. This preserves equality.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nSolve \\(m+4=-2\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: We want to make \\(m\\) the subject of the equation.\\[\\begin{align*} m+4 &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] 1 When a variable is the only term on one side of the equal sign we call it the subject. For example the formula for the area of a circle is \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\pi r^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] In this case the variable \\(A\\) is the subject.  To get \\(m\\) on its own we need to take \\(4\\) from both sides to get: \\[\\begin{align*} m+4-4 &amp; =-2-4\\\\ m &amp; =-6. \\end{align*}\\] 2 Remember that what you do to one side of an equation must be done to the other side to preserve equality. The solution is \\(m=4.\\) Note that you can always check your solution by substituting your answer into the original equation. In this case \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =m+4\\\\ &amp; =-6+4\\\\ &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.3 LHS and RHS are abbreviations for left hand side and right hand side respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nSolve \\(p-2=5\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: We want to make \\(p\\) the subject. To do this we add \\(2\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} p-2 &amp; =5\\\\ p-2+2 &amp; =5+2\\\\ p &amp; =7. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(p=7.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nSolve \\(3g=18.\\)\r\n\r\nSolution: To make \\(g\\) the subject we need to divide both sides by \\(3\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 3g &amp; =18\\\\ \\frac{3g}{3} &amp; =\\frac{18}{3}\\\\ g &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(g=6.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve \\(y\/4=12.\\)\r\n\r\nSolution: To make \\(y\\) the subject we multiply both sides by \\(4\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{4} &amp; =12\\\\ \\frac{y}{4}\\times4 &amp; =12\\times4\\\\ y &amp; =48. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(y=48.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore complex equations\r\nSome guidelines are:\r\n\r\n \tWith more complex equations it is necessary to perform several operations. As you become more experienced, you may perform several operations in one step.\r\n \tIf the variable appears in terms on both sides of the equation, you need to get these terms to one side of the equation and then solve for the variable.\r\n \tIf an equation involves brackets, the brackets should be expanded first.\r\n \tIf an equation involves fractions, you need to use a common denominator.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are illustrated in the following examples. Note that the strategy in the examples below is not part of the solution. It is the basic plan to solve the equation. You do NOT need to provide a strategy when solving problems. Nor do you need to describe each step. The strategy and description of each step is used below to show you the thinking that leads to the solution and the steps involved.\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nSolve \\(2w-3=-17.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: We want to make \\(w\\) the subject. We do this in two steps. First we get \\(2w\\) on its own then divide by two to get \\(w\\) as the subject. That is we add \\(3\\) to both sides and then divide both sides by \\(2\\).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 2w-3 &amp; =-17\\\\ 2w-3+3 &amp; =-17+3\\\\ 2w &amp; =-14\\\\ \\frac{2w}{2} &amp; =-\\frac{14}{2}\\\\ w &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(w=-7.\\) With more complex equations, it is a good idea to check your result. However, this is not necessary unless you are asked to check. In this example, \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2w-3\\\\ &amp; =2\\times\\left(-7\\right)-3\\\\ &amp; =-14-3\\\\ &amp; =-17\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nSolve: \\(\\frac{3d}{4}+5=7.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: First get the term involving \\(d\\) on its own by subtracting five from both sides, then solve for \\(d.\\)\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3d}{4}+5 &amp; =7\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}+5-5 &amp; =7-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $5\\text{ from both sides)}$ }\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4} &amp; =2\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}\\times4 &amp; =2\\times4\\quad\\text{(multiply both sides by $4$ )}\\\\ 3d &amp; =8\\\\ \\frac{3d}{3} &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $3)$ }\\\\ d &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Solution is \\(d=8\/3.\\)\r\n\r\nWe can check the solution (but this is not necessary) as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =\\frac{3d}{4}+5\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{3}+5\\\\ &amp; =2+5\\\\ &amp; =7\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 7: Variable on both sides\r\nSolve \\(3c+1=c-5\\).\r\n\r\nStrategy: First get all the \\(c\\) terms on one side then solve for \\(c\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3c+1 &amp; =c-5\\\\ 3c-c+1 &amp; =c-c-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $c$ from both sides to get $c$ terms to one side)}\\\\ 2c+1 &amp; =-5\\\\ 2c+1-1 &amp; =-5-1\\quad\\text{(subtract $1$ from both sides)}\\\\ 2c &amp; =-6\\\\ c &amp; =-3\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $2$ )}. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(c=-3.\\)\r\n\r\nCheck (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3c+1\\\\ &amp; =3\\left(-3\\right)+1\\\\ &amp; =-8.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =c-5\\\\ &amp; =-3-5\\\\ &amp; =-8\\\\ &amp; =\\text{LHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 8: Brackets\r\nSolve \\(3(5-2j)=33.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: First remove brackets and solve using the techniques shown above.\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3(5-2j) &amp; =33\\\\ 15-6j &amp; =33\\quad\\text{ (remove brackets) }\\\\ -6j &amp; =33-15\\quad\\text{(subract $15$ from both sides)}\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ j &amp; =\\frac{18}{-6}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $-6$ )}\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(j=-3.\\)\r\n\r\nCheck (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3(5-2j)\\\\ &amp; =15-6\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =15+18\\\\ &amp; =33\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 9: Brackets and variable on both sides\r\nSolve \\(2(3k-2)=5\\left(k+7\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: Remove brackets, get the variable on one side and then solve using the techniques shown above.\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2(3k-2) &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ 6k-4 &amp; =5k+35\\\\ 6k-5k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k &amp; =35+4\\\\ &amp; =39.\\\\ \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(k=39\\).\r\n\r\nCheck (not required)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2\\left(3k-2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6k-4\\\\ &amp; =6\\times39-4\\\\ &amp; =230.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\left(39+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\times46\\\\ &amp; =230\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 10: Fractions\r\nSolve \\(\\frac{h+1}{3}=\\frac{h}{4}\\).\r\n\r\nStrategy: Multiply both sides of the equation by a common denominator and solve using the techniques shown above.

When a number such as 16 is written in the form 42\u202f(which means 4 x 4) we say that it is written as an exponential, or in index notation.\r\nThere are laws about multiplying and dividing indices as well as how to deal with negative indices.\r\n\r\nThis module introduces rules for multiplying and dividing expressions using index notation. For example how to simplify expressions like \\(4a^{3}b\\times3ab^{5}\\) or \\(9a^{3}b^{2}c\\div3ab^{5}\\). We do not consider fractional indices which are covered in a different module. The plural of index is indices.\r\n\r\nHere's a video showing how the rules work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and learning centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on indices.\r\n\r\nStart by looking at what we mean by a base and an index. Here we have two to the power of three, in other words the two is the base, the three is the index or the power. Notice also that students tend to confuse this with the same as two times three, which it is not. Two to the power of three means two multiplied by itself three times, in other words two times two times two, which gives us an answer of eight.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at some examples; X to the power of four, well X is the base, four is the index, so it\u2019s X multiplied by itself four times, X times X times X times X. Here we have A squared times B to the power of five. Notice here that there are two different bases, A and B, so multiplying them out, A square is A times A, and B to the power of five is B times B times B times B times B. Finally we have four times M cubed times N cubed, so we leave the four alone and we multiply out the M three times, M times M times M, and the N is multiplied out three times as well, N times N times N, again the bases are different.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll now go through some laws of indices. Here\u2019s the first law of indices which says that X to the power of A times X to the power of B is the same as X to the power of A plus B. Notice here that the base must be the same but also that when we multiply terms with indices we actually add the indices.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do an example to illustrate this. We have A square times A to the five, so using the law that\u2019s the same as A to the two plus five. Notice here the base is the same so we can add the indices two plus five, so the answer is A to the seven. Similarly with numbers, three square times three cubed, the base are the same which means that we can add the indices, three to the two plus three which is three to the five, three to the five gives us an answer of 243.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, here\u2019s a problem where we have a number and a fractional index, four times X to the half times X to the half. So we leave the four alone, the base is the same, so we can add the indices, a half plus a half which is one, so we have four X to the one. Notice another important thing here is that X to the power of one is exactly the same as just X so we can leave our answer as four X.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at the second law of indices; X to the A divided by X to the B is the same as X to the A minus B. A couple of things to notice here, the bases must be the same and when the bases are the same and we\u2019re dividing terms we subtract the indices, so for example A to the five divided by A to the two, the base are the same therefore we can subtract the indices, five take away two is A cubed. Similarly with numbers, two to the seven divided by two to the four, the bases are the same therefore we can subtract the indices, two to the seven minus four is two to the three, which is two times two times two, which gives us an answer of eight.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, here are two numbers, 10 and five, 10 to the X to 11 divided by five X to the six. Here we can divide the numbers, 10 divided by five gives us two, that\u2019s one part of this problem. The other part is dividing the terms with indices, X to the 11 divided by X to the six, the bases are the same therefore we can subtract the indices, so it\u2019s X to the 11 minus six which gives us five. In other words our answer is two X to the five.\r\n\r\nThe third law of indices says that X to the power of zero is equal to one. Now notice that any base with a power of zero will always give us an answer of one. Let\u2019s look at the reason behind this. Let\u2019s look at this problem, A cubed divided by A cubed, if I do this the long way I\u2019ve got the fraction as shown, A times A times A on the top, A times A times A on the bottom, notice they all cancel giving us an answer of one. But there\u2019s a quicker way of doing this using this law; A cubed divided by A cubed, same base therefore we can subtract the indices, three minus three is zero, that gives us A to the power of zero and the third law says that anything with a power of zero to it gives us an answer of one.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at the fourth law of indices. Notice here that we have brackets with an index inside and an index outside. So when we have this situation we multiply the indices, we don\u2019t add them, we multiply them, so here X to the A all inside brackets with an index of B outside of the brackets gives us an answer of X to the A times B. So for example four cubed in brackets to the power of two would give us four times four times four multiplied by four times four times four, this is the long way of doing this, which gives us an answer of four to the six. But if we use the law we multiply out the indices, in other words four cubed to the power of two is four to the three times two which is four to the six, as you can see a much quicker way of working out this problem.\r\n\r\nNotice also when we have a fraction as a base we do exactly the same as before. In other words the numerator is four, the denominator is five, so they both get indexed, in other words four cubed divided by five cubed and that gives us four times four times four which is 64 divided by five times five times five which is 125, so remember, with a fraction you use both the numerator and the denominator will have the base to it.\r\n\r\nFinally, let\u2019s look at square roots and cubed roots as indices. Notice a couple of things here; that the index inside the root is the numerator of our new index and the index outside the root is the denominator of our new index. Let\u2019s illustrate this with an example, here we have the square root of X which is the same as X to the power of one inside the square roots and we could put a two outside the square root as well and using the rule above that will give us an answer of X to the one over two, or X to the half, so the square root of X is the same as X to the half.\r\n\r\nSimilarly here we have the cubed root of X squared, so the square is on the top of our new index, the cubed root is on the bottom of our new index, so that gives us an answer of X to the two over three or X to the two thirds.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex notation\r\nConsider the following examples:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 3^{4} &amp; =3\\times3\\times3\\times3=81\\\\ 5^{3} &amp; =5\\times5\\times5=125\\\\ 2^{7} &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2=128 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn general: \\[ a^{n}=\\underbrace{a\\times a\\times a\\times\\ldots\\times a}_{n\\textrm{ factors}} \\] The letter \\(n\\) in \\(a^{n}\\) is referred to in one of three ways:\r\n\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the index in \\(a^{n}\\) with \\(a\\) known as the base.\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the exponent or power to which the base \\(a\\) is raised.\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the logarithm, with \\(a\\) as the base. (see the Logarithms module)\r\n\r\nWhen a number such as \\(125\\) is written in the form \\(5^{3}\\) we say it is written as an exponential or in index notation. Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions written in index notation is achieved using index laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex laws\r\nThis section states and gives examples of universal index laws.\r\n\r\nFirst Index Law\r\nTo multiply index expressions you add the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{3}\\times2^{2} &amp; =\\left(2\\times2\\times2\\right)\\times\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\\\ &amp; =2^{5} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(2^{3}\\times2^{2}=2^{3+2}=2^{5}\\). In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Index Law\r\nTo divide expressions subtract the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{5}\\div3^{3} &amp; =\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3\\times3\\times3\\times3}{3\\times3\\times3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3}{1}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling three lots of 3}\\\\ &amp; =3^{2} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(3^{5}\\div3^{3}=\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}=3^{5-3}=3^{2}.\\) In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\div a^{n}=\\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}}=a^{m-n},\\quad a\\neq0 \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that expressions in index form can only be multiplied or divided if they have the same base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Index Law\r\nTo raise an expression in index form to a power, multiply the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\\\ &amp; =5^{2+2+2}\\quad\\textrm{using the first index law}\\\\ &amp; =5^{6} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3}=5^{2\\times3}=5^{6}.\\) In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Index Law: \\[ \\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{m\\times n} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also leads to the expression: \\[\\begin{align*} (a^{m}b^{p})^{n} &amp; =a^{mn}b^{pn} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nBe careful as this is true for multiplication and division only , not addition or subtraction , so that \\((a+b)^{n}\\neq a^{n}+b^{n}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of index laws\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(x^{5}\\times x^{6}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{5}\\times x^{6} &amp; =x^{5+6}\\quad\\textrm{by the first law}\\\\ &amp; =x^{11} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(a^{5}\\div a^{3}.\\)\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} a^{5}\\div a^{3} &amp; =\\frac{a^{5}}{a^{3}}=a^{5-3}\\quad\\textrm{by the second law}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4} &amp; =c^{3\\times4}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =c^{12} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =2^{3}\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{2\\times3}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{6} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that terms with different bases must be considered seperately when using the index laws , such as \\((2a^{3}b^{2})^{4}=2^{4}a^{12}b^{8}\\)\r\n\r\nExercise 1 provides practice for these laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZero index\r\nSo far we have only considered expressions in which each index is a positive whole number1 Whole numbers are called integers and positive whole numbers are called the positive integers.. The index laws also apply if the index is zero, negative or a fraction (fractional indices will be dealt with in another module).\r\n\r\nConsider \\(2^{3}\\div2^{3}=\\frac{2^{3}}{2^{3}}=\\frac{2\\times2\\times2}{2\\times2\\times2}=\\frac{8}{8}=8\\div8=1\\). Using the second law, \\(2^{3}\\div2^{3}=2^{3-3}=2^{0}\\)\r\n\r\ntherefore \\(1=2^{0}\\). In general any expression with a zero index is equal to 1. Also note that \\(0^{0}\\) is ambiguous and so we don\u2019t allow \\(a=0\\) in this law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZero law of indices: \\[ a^{0}=1,\\qquad a\\neq0 \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of the Zero Index Law\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 7^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(xy\\right)^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(28x^{2}\\right)^{0}=1\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegative indices\r\nConsider \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{0}\\div2^{4} &amp; =\\frac{2^{0}}{2^{4}}\\quad\\textrm{remember that $2^{0}=1$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2^{4}}. \\end{align*}\\] But \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{0}\\div2^{4} &amp; =2^{0-4}\\quad\\textrm{using the second law}\\\\ &amp; =2^{-4}. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}=2^{-4}\\) and \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}=\\frac{1}{2^{4}}\\)\r\n\r\ntherefore \\(2^{-4}=\\frac{1}{2^{4}}\\).

The logarithm of a number is the power that the base must be raised to, to give that number. The logarithm of 16 with a base of 2 is 4, because 2to the power of 4 = 16.\r\nThe modeling of growth and decay in areas such as finance, epidemiology and science makes use of equations with logarithms and exponentials. For example the equation \\(\\log_{e}\\frac{N}{N_{0}}\\approx-\\lambda t\\) is used to describe radioactive decay. The laws for working with logarithms enable us to solve equations that cannot be solved with other algebraic techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on logarithms.\r\n\r\nA logarithm is an index but let\u2019s look at an index first. Here\u2019s the number eight, eight is the same as two to the power of three. Three things here, eight is the number, two is the base and three is the index, two to the power of three is two times two times two which is eight. So here it is again, eight equals two to the power of three. Now this can be written as log of eight to the base two equals three. Notice the three in red, the index three and the logarithm three. Also note the base two, both two to the three and log of eight to the base two. In other words we can write the equivalence here, A to the power of X is equal to N is the same as log of N to the base A is X. Notice the index in red and the logarithm in red.\r\n\r\nNow look at some examples, five to the power of three is 125 which is the same as log of 125 to the base five is three. Notice in each case as I go through these that the index and the logarithm are shown in red. Here\u2019s another one, three to the negative two is equal to one over nine, log of one over nine to the base three is negative two and finally 25 to the power of one half is five is the same as log of five to the base 25 is equal to the half. Study these carefully before moving on to the next slide.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s work out log of 64 to the base four. We\u2019ll write the equivalent statement first and beneath that log of 64 to the base four which equals X is the same as four to the power of X is 64. In other words what we\u2019re trying to do here is working out what the X value is, the power of four. So four cubed gives us 64, four times four times four, in other words X is equal to three, therefore log of 64 to the base four is equal to three.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another problem but this time we\u2019re solving log of X to the base two equals five. In the previous slide we were working out what the logarithm was, here we\u2019re working out what the number is, which is X in this case. First of all let\u2019s write the equivalent statement and then plugging our log over X to the base two equals five into that equivalent statement gives us two to the power of five is equal to X. In other words we\u2019re working out what two to the power of five is, which is two times two times two times two times two, which is 32, in other words X is equal to 32.\r\n\r\nNow here are two important logarithm rules. The first rule is A to the power of zero is equal to one, which the same as log of one to the base A is equal to zero. In other words for any base the log of one is zero. Second rule is A to the power of one is equal to A or the log of A to the same base A is equal to one, in other words the log of any number with itself as base is equal to one.\r\n\r\nThere are three laws of logarithms that you must know. Here\u2019s the first one. The log of two numbers multiplied together, M N is equal to the log of M plus the log of N. For instance here\u2019s the log of 15 and 15 is five times three, so the log of five times three is equal to the log of five plus the log of three.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the second law. The log of a quotient, in other words M divided by N is equal to log of M minus log of N. So for instance if we have the log of 12 over five that is the same as log of 12 subtract the log of five and finally the log of a number to a power, in this case log of M to the power of P is the same as P log of M. Notice how the index here is now placed in front of the log. So for instance the log of nine to the power of two is the same as two log of nine but notice nine is the same as three squared so we can go one step further and write two log three squared, again using the law three squared we can place the two in front so it now becomes two times two log of three which is four log of three.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourselves. The answers to these problems are on the next slide.

This means that a logarithm (or log) is an index. Every index or log expression contains a number, a base and an index. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we say \" eight is equal to two to the power of three\".\r\n\r\nThis statement has an equivalent logarithmic form and may be written as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe say \u201cthe log to base two of eight is equal to three\u201d (the power of two that gives eight is three).\r\n\r\nGenerally, providing \\(a&gt;0,\\ n&gt;0\\) and \\(a\\neq1\\),\r\n\r\n\\[ a^{x}=n\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{a}n=x \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogarithms and the calculator\r\nWhile any positive number except one can be the base of a logarithm, \\(10\\) and \\(e\\) are most common.\r\n\r\nTo find the power of \\(10\\) that produces \\(50\\) we use the LOG button on the calculator: \\(\\log_{10}50\\approx1.7\\) and \\(10^{1.7}\\approx50\\).\r\n\r\nTo find the power of \\(e\\) that produces \\(50\\) we use the LN button on the calculator: \\(\\log_{e}50=\\ln50\\approx3.9\\) and \\(e^{3.9}\\approx50\\).\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \t\\(5^{3}=125\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{5}125\\) \\(=3\\)\r\n \t\\(3^{-2}=\\frac{1}{9}\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{3}\\frac{1}{9}=-2\\)\r\n \t\\(25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=5\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{25}5=\\frac{1}{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluating logarithms\r\nTo evaluate a logarithm it may be helpful to create an equation and change to index form.\r\n\r\n \tEvaluate \\(\\log_{5}125\\)\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Let}\\log_{5}125 &amp; =x\\\\ 5^{x} &amp; =125\\textrm{ (change to index form)}\\\\ 5^{x} &amp; =5^{3}\\,\\textrm{(express 125 as a power of 5)}\\\\ x &amp; =3\\,\\textrm{(equating indices)}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tEvaluate \\(\\log_{10}0.0001\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Let}\\log_{10}0.0001 &amp; =x\\\\ 10^{x} &amp; =0.0001\\textrm{ (change to index form)}\\\\ 10^{x} &amp; =10^{-4}\\,\\textrm{(express 0.0001 as a power of 10})\\\\ x &amp; =-4\\,\\textrm{(equating indices)}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree important properties of logarithms\r\n\r\n \tFor \\(a&gt;0,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} a=1\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{a}1=0. \\end{align*}\\] That is, for any \\(a&gt;0,\\) the log of 1 is zero.\r\n \tFor \\(a&gt;0\\) \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =a^{1}\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{a}a=1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIf \\(\\log_{a}m=\\log_{a}p\\) then \\(m=p\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogarithm laws\r\nCorresponding to the three index laws, there are three laws of logarithms to help in manipulating logarithms.

We still get a solution to the system of equations but it will look different. we set \\(z=t.\\) From \\(R_{2}\\) and substituting \\(t\\) for \\(z\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y+z &amp; =1\\\\ y+t &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =1-t. \\end{align*}\\] Now from \\(R_{1}\\), substituting \\(z=t,\\,y=1-t\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+2\\left(1-t\\right)-t &amp; =3\\\\ x+2-2t-t &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =1+3t. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution is \\(x=1+3t,\\,y=1-t\\) and \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).3 As there are an infinite number of choices for \\(t,\\) there are an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations. \r\n\r\nIn general if the reduced augmented matrix has one or more rows of zeros, there will be an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations.4 You may recall that the determinant of a matrix with a row of zeros is zero.

Q\\(_{1}\\) is the median of the lower half of the data and Q\\(_{3}\\) is the median of the upper half of the data.\r\n\r\n(Note: there are other ways to find Q\\(_{1}\\) and Q\\(_{3}\\) so check with your teacher.)\r\n\r\nSet Y: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{1\\quad\\downarrow\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad2\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad2\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{2}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\)\r\n\r\nThe arrows indicate the location of the quartiles and \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{1+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =1.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{2+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is IQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}\\) = 2 \u2013 1.5 = 0.5.\r\n\r\nNow consider the other set of data:\r\n\r\nSet Z: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{18\\quad\\downarrow\\quad23}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad41\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad59\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{63}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad87}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\)\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{18+23}{2}\\\\ &amp; =20.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{63+87}{2}\\\\ &amp; =75. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is\r\n\r\nIQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}=75-20.5=54.5\\)\r\n\r\nSo for the data sets Y and Z the mean together with the IQR are better summaries of the data sets than the range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard deviation\r\nA measure of dispersion or spread in a data set that takes into account all of the data is the standard deviation. It gives an indication of the typical or average distance of each score from the mean for the data. The standard deviation can be calculated using the formula \\[ s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \\] but it is much more convenient to use your calculator or the computer.\r\n\r\nSome statistical tests make use of the variance which is the square of the standard deviation:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\text{Variance $=$ }s^{2}=\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}. \\]\r\n\r\nSet A:\\(\\quad4\\quad4\\quad5\\quad5\\quad5\\quad6\\quad6\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\overline{x}=5\\)\r\n\r\n\\(s=0.82\\)\r\n\r\nSet B: \\(\\quad1\\quad3\\quad4\\quad5\\quad6\\quad7\\quad9\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\overline{x}=5\\)\r\n\r\n\\(s=2.65\\)\r\n\r\nWe can interpret the standard deviation: the scores in set A are typically \\(0.82\\) away from the mean, but the scores in set B are typically \\(2.65\\) away from the mean. Though set A and B have the same centre, those in set B are clearly more dispersed or have greater spread than set A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n1.

They give us an understanding of how buildings, structures, automobiles and materials react in real life. Moreover they are useful for data scientists.\r\nThis module does not go into each of these facets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors but describes the method for calculating them.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\nLet \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. 1 The order of a matrix \\(A\\) is the number of rows in \\(A\\) times the number of columns in \\(A.\\) If \\(A\\) is a matrix with \\(5\\) rows and \\(6\\) columns, it is said to be a \\(5\\times6\\) (read as five times six) matrix, or has order \\(5\\times6\\). Eigenvector and eigenvalue problems are restricted to square matrices that is, the number of rows and columns of the matrix must be equal.\r\n\r\nLet \\(X\\) be an \\(n\\times1\\) vector. 2 Note that \\(X\\) is a column matrix (also known as a column vector).\r\n\r\nIf for some constant \\(\\lambda\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nthen \\(\\lambda\\) is called an eigenvalue of \\(A\\) and \\(X\\) is called an eigenvector of \\(A.\\) Note that \\(X\\) is a column vector of order \\(\\left(n\\times1\\right)\\). We write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n} \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Usually, if \\(A\\) is a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding eigenvalues\r\nRemember that the determinant of a matrix \\(A\\) may be written as \\(\\det A\\) or \\(\\left|A\\right|\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a square matrix \\(A\\) the eigenvalues are found by solving the equation \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)=\\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tEquation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is called the CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION of the matrix \\(A.\\) So to find eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation.\r\n \tIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, there will be at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues of \\(A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFind the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nThe \\(2\\times2\\) identity matrix, \\[\\begin{align*} I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\lambda &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(4\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that in practice we would not bother to include steps \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) above. We would just go directly to \\(\\left(5\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nTo find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\).3 This is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\]  That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(-4-\\lambda\\right)\\left(3-\\lambda\\right)-3\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -12+4\\lambda-3\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}+6 &amp; =0\\\\ \\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6 &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] The equation \\(\\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6=0\\) is the characteristic equation of the matrix \\(A.\\) Factorising the characteristic equation, 4 Sometimes it is not so easy to factorise the equation. In this case you can use the quadratic formula. The solution of the quadratic \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] is given by \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda-6\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\lambda+3\\right)\\left(\\lambda-2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\lambda=-3\\) or \\(\\lambda=2\\). The two eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nFind the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and to find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(2-\\lambda\\right)\\left(2-\\lambda\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=2\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). Note there are two eigenvalues but they have the same value. These are called repeated eigenvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEigenvectors\r\nTo each eigenvalue of a matrix \\(A\\) there is a corresponding eigenvector.\r\n\r\nTo find the eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above for each eigenvalue. It is useful to rearrange equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) as follows \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X\\\\ AX-\\lambda X &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we don\u2019t write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda\\right)X=0\\) because this makes no sense. \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix and \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar (a number). You can\u2019t subtract a number from a matrix and so we write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X\\) as in equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo obtain eigenvectors, we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] for each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a multiple of any eigenvector is an eigenvector. We do not consider \\(\\vec{X}=\\vec{0}\\) to be an eigenvector.\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nFind the eigenvectors of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom example 1 above we know the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). We need to solve \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] to get the eigenvectors. Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] where \\(X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right].\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\left(-3\\right) &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\left(-3\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+6y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] These cannot be solved to give a unique solution as one is a multiple of another.5 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Dividing the second equation by \\(3\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =-2y. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(y=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the solution is \\(x=-2t,\\,y=t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2t\\\\ t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] As \\(t\\) can be any number there are an infinite number of eigenvectors. However, the convention is that we recognise any eigenvector multiplied by a scalar is still an eigenvector and we state the eigenvector in the lowest possible terms. So, the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-2 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -6 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -6x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Again we see that the one equation is a multiple of another.6 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Let \\(x=t\\) then from the second equation, \\(y=-3t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} t\\\\ -3t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In lowest terms, the eigenvalue corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSee exercise 1 for some practice examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors for \\(3\\times3\\) matrices\r\nRegardless of the size of the matrix, the method is the same. For eigenvalues we solve equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) and for eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nFind the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nFirst find the eigenvalues by solving: \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\det\\left[B-\\lambda I\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\lambda &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\lambda &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left[-\\lambda\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(1\\right)\\right]-1\\left[-1\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(-2\\right)\\right]-2\\left[1\\left(-1\\right)-\\left(-2\\right)\\left(-\\lambda\\right)\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left(-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1\\right)-\\left(-1+\\lambda+2\\right)-2\\left(-1-2\\lambda\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1+\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda^{3}+\\lambda+1-\\lambda-2+2+4\\lambda\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda. \\end{align*}\\] The characteristic equation is: 7 Note that the characteristic equation is a cubic, that is it is a polynomial of degree \\(3\\). If we had a \\(4\\times4\\) matrix, the characteristic equation would be a polynomial of degree \\(4\\) and so on. \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] To solve this, we factorize to get: \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda^{2}-2\\lambda-3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda-3\\right)\\left(\\lambda+1\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are: \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) In many courses you may solve the characteristic equation using a CAS calculator. Check this with your teacher.\r\n\r\nWe now find the eigenvectors by solving equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) for each eigenvalue.\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\)we have 8 Note that \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ -x+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Solution of these equations may be done manually or, in some courses, with a CAS calculator. Check with your teacher if you are allowed to solve them with a calculator. We solve them manually below.\r\n\r\nFrom equation \\(\\left(9\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =x. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this in \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+y-2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =y. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(x=y=z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=0\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; -3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ -x-3y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(12\\right)\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(13\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Equations \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(13\\right)\\) are identical and so we have to solve \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right).\\) Let \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right)\\) become \\[\\begin{align*} -2x+y &amp; =2t &amp; \\left(14\\right)\\\\ -x-3y &amp; =-t. &amp; \\left(15\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) by 2 and subtracting from \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y &amp; =4t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{4}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) by 3 and adding to \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -7x &amp; =5t\\\\ x &amp; =-\\frac{5}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\frac{5}{7}\\\\ \\frac{4}{7}\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) is (setting \\(t=7)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -5\\\\ 4\\\\ 7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(16\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we chose \\(t=7\\) to get rid of the fraction in the eigenvector. Note also that the eigenvector \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is also correct as it is just \\(\\left(16\\right)\\) multiplied by \\(-1.\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ 2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(17\\right)\\\\ -x+y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(18\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(19\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding \\(\\left(17\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(19\\right)\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this into \\(\\left(18\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -x+y+z &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =z. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(z=t,\\) \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector to \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{3} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] To summarise, the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) The corresponding eigenvectors are \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nAre \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] eigenvectors of \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\)?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this problem is to do as in Example 4 above and calculate all the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. However, this is the long way. A shorter and better way is to use the definition of the eigenvector in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above.9 Recall equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X. \\end{align*}\\] \r\n\r\nFor \\(X_{1}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times1-5\\times2+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times1-2\\times2+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times1-1\\times2-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(20\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{1}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(20\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(21\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The first two rows of \\(\\left(21\\right)\\) imply that \\(\\lambda=-1.\\) But then the third row implies that \\(-5=-1\\) which is a contradiction. We conclude that \\(X_{1}\\)is not an eigenvector of \\(A.\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(X_{2}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-5\\times0+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)-1\\times0-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(22\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{2}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(22\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\lambda\\\\ 0\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] It is clear that \\(\\lambda=-7\\) and so \\(X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) is an eigenvector of the matrix \\(A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant points to remember\r\n\r\n \tAn \\(n\\times n\\) matrix will have at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues.\r\n \tAn eigenvalue may be zero.\r\n \tAn eigenvector multiplied by any number other than 0 is also an eigenvector.

Maths resources uplift The ongoing improvement of the maths pages in the Learning Lab continues with learning modules being converted from PDF to accessible HTML. Formatting and styles on these pages have been updated to provide a more consistent and accessible experience. These changes have extended across the Learning Lab and are a welcome improvement throughout the site. The menu pages have all been updated to a more user-friendly list format, moving away from obscuring this content within accordions. We have begun adding short descriptions of each page to these menus to make it easier for users to identify the content that they need. Don't worry about those poor, lost accordions though. They have found a more useful purpose, logically 'hiding' the answers to quizzes in the maths pages until the user chooses to reveal them. Behind the scenes Customer Experience (CX) workshops The RMIT University Library Digital Learning Team have run 4 workshops with over 30 members of the RMIT Library Learning teams. The workshops have two formats, one for small groups and one for larger groups. Regardless of the group size, the workshops ask participants to think about how the 7 library user types, identified in the Library's Digital Experience Plan, and how these users find and interact with the Learning Lab. Using Teams breakout groups and Miro boards, we have structured an interactive and informative way for participants to think of existing and novel ways to engage users in the Learning Lab and to improve their experience of learning objects when they are there. These workshops have been critical insights as the Learning Team provide front-line support and resources to students and have unique insights on the RMIT student need.  The Digital Learning Team have received some invaluable feedback and direction on:  Reaching user types to make them aware of the Learning Lab Improving the experience of users once they are on the Learning Lab Ideas about how we can best structure the resources Insight into taxonomy and how we can best use tags to improve the user experience Missing resources &ndash; sought after information that would benefit the student cohort.

Some integrals cannot be evaluated in terms of the rules of integration or elementary functions.\r\nYou will have evaluated definite integrals such as \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3} &amp; \\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] before. In doing this, you are evaluating the area under the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3.\\) This is only possible if you can find an antiderivative for \\(x^{2}\\). In this example it is easy, the antiderivative is \\[\\begin{align*} F\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\text{ where $c$ is a constant.} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3}\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =F\\left(3\\right)-F\\left(1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}3^{3}+c-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}1^{3}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{26}{3}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is not possible to find the antiderivative. In such cases you need to use a numerical method. Two common methods for calculating definite integrals are:\r\n\r\n \tSimpson\u2019s rule, and\r\n \tThe trapezoidal rule.\r\n\r\nThis module considers the trapezoidal rule.\r\n\r\nThe trapezoidal rule\r\nThe trapezoidal rule works by estimating the area under a graph by a series of trapezoidal strips. In the figure below, we see an approximation to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{6} &amp; xe^{-0.5x}dx \\end{align*}\\] using three strips. The approximated area is shown in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, we see the trapezoidal rule will underestimate the first strip, is close in the second strip and will overestimate in the third strip.

Slow convergence implies many iterations, while fast convergence means few iterations.\r\n\r\nConvergence of the method depends on the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and the initial guess.

We assume an accuracy to two decimal places and a calculation tolerance of \\(0.0000001\\).\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.1\\). In this region the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is close to zero. Newton\u2019s method takes 25 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.25\\) then it takes 15 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.5\\) then it takes 9 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.75\\) then it takes 6 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nSo we see the number of iterations decrease (higher convergence) when the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvergence to another root\r\nIf the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) has several roots, Newton\u2019s method may converge to any of these. For example the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}+2x^{2}-5x-6\\) has three roots at \\(x=-3,-1\\) and \\(2\\) as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we set \\(x_{0}=-2\\) we, perhaps, would think the method should find the root \\(x=-3\\text{ or $-1$ }.\\) But Newton\u2019s method finds the root at \\(x=2.\\) This is why it is important to graph the function if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, NM1 Newton\u2019s method (PDF 727KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"You are used to solving equations using basic algebraic operations and perhaps the quadratic formula.

For example, the melting of ice to give water is a physical change because water only changes its physical state from solid to liquid without affecting its chemical identity.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n \tthe grating of a piece of cheese\r\n \tboiling of water\r\n \tsugar dissolving in water\r\n\r\nChemical change\r\nA chemical change is a process in which the substance changes its chemical identity or composition. It involves the formation of new substances that have different properties compared to the original substance. For example, iron objects turn reddish-brown (known as rusting) when exposed to moist air for a long period is a chemical change because iron combines with oxygen and moisture from the air to form a new substance, rust.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n \tsugar heated in a saucepan to make caramel\r\n \tburning of potassium in water\r\n \tmilk turning sour\r\n\r\nClassification of matter\r\nThe flowchart below shows how you can determine the classification of matter through a series of simple yes\/no questions.\r\n\r\nClassification of matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter\r\n\r\nAnything that has mass and occupies space\r\n\r\n\r\nAre properties and composition constant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\nPure substance\r\n\r\nA substance that has a uniform chemical composition throughout\r\ne.g. Water, sugar, table salt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan the pure substance be broken into simpler substances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical compound\r\n\r\nCan be chemically broken down into constituent elements e.g. Water, sugar, table salt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\nElement\r\n\r\nCannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical or physical means e.g. Hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\nMixture\r\n\r\nPhysical combination of two or more pure substances\r\ne.g. Salt-sand mixture, sea water, concrete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the mixture have a uniform composition throughout?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\nHomogenous Mixture\r\n\r\nOne visible phase which has uniform composition throughout e.g. Sea water, coffee, air\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\nHetereogeneous mixture\r\n\r\nTwo or more visible phases which have non-uniform composition throughout e.g. Vegetable stew, meat pie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Quiz\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also use the States of Matter: Interactive\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]","excerpt":"Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.

Two new sections have been created to house introduction to law materials and assessment help specific to law assignments. Materials in these sections will help students studying law subjects and those who have legal issues as part of the subject matter of their courses. We have launched two new interactive videos that step students through finding Australian state and federal case law and legislation. New guides to writing case notes and legal memos complement the existing materials on writing law essays.      The finishing touches are changing the referencing to AGLC4 throughout the text, checking case citations for currency and relevancy and auditing the other materials in the Law section.

You cannot subtract matrices that have different shape. As another example consider \\(B-A\\) we have \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} B-A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 0-2 &amp; 2-(-1)\\\\ 3-1 &amp; 1-5 &amp; -2-(-4) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{alignat*}\\] Note that \\(A-B\\neq B-A\\). The order in which matrices are subtracted is important just as it is when subtracting real numbers. In fact, \\(B-A=-\\left(A-B\\right)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScalar multiplication\r\nMatrices may be multiplied by a number. To do this each element in the matrix is multiplied by the number.\r\n\r\nFor example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\textrm{ and $B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} 5A &amp; =5\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5\\times1 &amp; 5\\times2\\\\ 5\\times5 &amp; 5\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 10\\\\ 25 &amp; 20 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAnother example is \\[\\begin{align*} -2A &amp; =-2\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2\\times1 &amp; -2\\times2\\\\ -2\\times5 &amp; -2\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2 &amp; -4\\\\ -10 &amp; -8 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nYou can also use scalar multiplication with addition or subtraction.

We could also say the order of \\(A\\) is \\(1\\times4\\). The matrix \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 5\\\\ 2 &amp; 6\\\\ 4 &amp; 7\\\\ 5 &amp; 89 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is a \\(5\\times2\\) matrix because it has \\(5\\) rows and \\(2\\) columns. It has order \\(5\\times2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions for matrix multiplication\r\nTwo matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns of the first matrix is the same as the number of rows of the second matrix. The result of the multiplication is another matrix with the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. If this is not the case, the multiplication is undefined.\r\n\r\nSymbolically let \\(A\\) be an \\(m\\times p\\) matrix and let \\(B\\) be an \\(q\\times n\\) matrix. Then the product \\(A\\times B=AB\\) will be an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix provided that \\(p=q\\). If \\(p\\neq q\\) the matrix multiplication is not defined. For example, a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix cannot be multiplied by a \\(1\\times4\\) matrix because \\(3\\neq1\\) whereas it is possible to multiply a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatrix multiplication\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] we want to find, if it exists, the product \\(AB\\). First note that we are multiplying a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and so matrix multiplication is possible and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix. You should always check that the multiplication is possible.\r\n\r\nNow the multiplication procedure is a bit strange at first. The first element of row \\(1\\) of the resulting matrix \\(AB\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+4\\times3+5\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2+12+20 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 2nd element of row \\(1\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2\\times6+4\\times1+5\\times2\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 12+4+10\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 1st element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7\\times1+8\\times3+9\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Finally the the 2nd element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 7\\times6+8\\times1+9\\times2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 42+8+18 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 68 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Find a) \\(AB\\;\\) b) \\(BA\\;\\) c) \\(AA\\;\\) d) \\(BB\\) if they exist.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n \tSince \\(A\\) is \\(2\\times2\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(2\\times3\\), the number of columns in \\(A\\) is equal to the number of rows in \\(B\\) and so \\(AB\\) exists and will be a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2\\times2+1\\times0 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times0 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times2 &amp; 3\\times0+0\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tThe number of columns of \\(B\\) is \\(3\\) and the number of rows of \\(A\\) is \\(2\\). Since they are unequal, \\(BA\\) is not defined and \\(BA\\) does not exist.\r\n \tSince \\(A\\) has the same number of rows and columns1 \\(A\\) is called a square matrix.  and so \\(AA\\) exists.2 We sometimes write \\(AA=A^{2.}.\\) We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2+1\\times3 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times0\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times3 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 7 &amp; 2\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tThe number of columns and rows in \\(B\\) are unequal and so \\(BB\\) does not exist.3 Only square matrices can be squared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] find if they exist, a) \\(AB\\) and b) \\(BA\\).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n \tSince the number of columns and rows is the same for matrices \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), both \\(BC\\) and \\(CB\\) exist and will be \\(2\\times2\\) matrices. We have \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+\\left(-1\\right)\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\\\ 1\\times1+3\\times2 &amp; 1\\times0+3\\times\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 7 &amp; -3 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} BA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times2+0\\times1 &amp; 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)+0\\times3\\\\ 2\\times2+\\left(-1\\right)\\times1 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)+\\left(-1\\right)\\times3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom this example we can see that, in general, \\(AB\\neq BA\\). We say that matrix multiplication is not commutative and the order of multiplication matters. There is an exception to this as explained in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplication by the unit matrix\r\nA square matrix with ones along its leading diagonal and zeros elsewhere is called a unit matrix (also called an identity matrix). The order of the unit matrix is sometimes noted with a subscript. For example,\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} I_{1}=\\left[1\\right],\\;I_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe unit matrix acts like the number one in the real number system. When matrix multiplication is defined, multiplication by the unit matrix leaves the original matrix unchanged.\r\n\r\nMultiplying a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by the unit matrix \\(I_{n}\\) shows that the order of multiplication does not matter.4 This is only true for square matrices That is \\[\\begin{align*} AI_{n} &amp; =I_{n}A. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor example, let \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Since \\(A\\) has two columns we need the unit matrix to have two rows and two columns. That is \\(I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} AI &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+2\\times0 &amp; 1\\times0+2\\times1\\\\ 3\\times1+3\\times0 &amp; 3\\times0+4\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} IA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+0\\times3 &amp; 1\\times2+0\\times4\\\\ 0\\times1+1\\times3 &amp; 0\\times2+1\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A. \\end{align*}\\] So, in this case, \\(AI=IA=A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 3\\\\ -2 &amp; -4\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -5\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 4\\\\ 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 2\\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -3 &amp; 2 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Find (if they exist)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllllcc} a)\\,BA &amp; b)\\,DB &amp; c)\\,CD &amp; d)\\,AA=A^{2} &amp; e)\\,BB=B^{2} &amp; f)\\,AD &amp; g)\\,BE &amp; h)\\,EA &amp; i)\\,CB\\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n \t\\(BA=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 7 &amp; 8\\\\ -12 &amp; -10\\\\ 8 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\)\r\n \t\\(DB\\) does not exist.\r\n \t\\(CD=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 21\\\\ -3\\\\ 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\)\r\n \t\\(A^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 15 &amp; -7\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 \\end{array}\\right]\\)\r\n \t\\(B^{2}\\) does not exist.\r\n \t\\(AD\\) does not exist.\r\n \t\\(BE=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -3 &amp; 17 &amp; -3\\\\ 6 &amp; -24 &amp; 4\\\\ -6 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\)\r\n \t\\(EA\\) does not exist.\r\n \t\\(CB=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -9 &amp; 5\\\\ 10 &amp; 6\\\\ -5 &amp; -21 \\end{array}\\right]\\).\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M3 Matrix multiplication (PDF 128KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Matrices may be added and subtracted if they have the same shape; that is, the number of rows and columns is the same.

Now we expand along column \\(2\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|B\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1} &amp; b_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{2} &amp; b_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; b_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-b_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|+b_{2}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|-b_{3}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{2} &amp; c_{2} \\end{array}\\right|. \\end{align*}\\] Again, note the sign changes.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nCalculate the determinant of \\[ A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]. \\]\r\n\r\nSolution 1:\r\n\r\nExpanding along row one we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =2\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|+3\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(\\left(-1\\right)\\times4-1\\times2\\right)-\\left(1\\times4-2\\times2\\right)+3\\left(1\\times1-2\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(-4-2\\right)-\\left(4-4\\right)+3\\left(1+2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-12+9\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSolution 2:\r\n\r\nThis time we will expand about column 2 to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left(1\\times4-2\\times2\\right)-\\left(2\\times4-2\\times3\\right)-1\\left(2\\times2-1\\times3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left(4-4\\right)-\\left(8-6\\right)-1\\left(4-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-2-1\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nCalculate the determinant of \\[ B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]. \\]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nExpanding along column 1 we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|B\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|+2\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =1\\left(\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-4\\right)-6\\times3\\right)-1\\left(3\\times\\left(-4\\right)-6\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)+2\\left(3\\times3-\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(4-18\\right)-\\left(-12-\\left(-12\\right)\\right)+2\\left(9-2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-14+14\\\\ &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Note that row \\(3\\) of \\(B\\) is a multiple of row \\(1.\\) In general, when a row is a multiple of another row, the determinant is zero. Also if a column is a multiple of another column, the determinant is zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nCalculate the determinant of \\[ C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\] Solution:\r\n\r\nThis time it is best to expand about column \\(2\\) or row \\(3.\\) This is because column \\(2\\) or row \\(3\\) contains a zero which makes the calculation easier. Expanding along row \\(3\\) we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|C\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =4\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 6\\\\ -2 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|-0\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|+1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 5\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =4\\left(5\\times2-\\left(-2\\right)\\times6\\right)+1\\left(1\\times\\left(-2\\right)-3\\times5\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4\\left(10+12\\right)+1\\left(-2-15\\right)\\\\ &amp; =88-17\\\\ &amp; =71. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 2 for some practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluating higher order determinants\r\nFourth order determinants can be evaluated using third order determinants and fifth order by using fourth order and so forth. When doing this, you need to apply the following signs \\[ \\left|\\begin{array}{ccccc} + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; \\cdots\\\\ - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; \\cdots\\\\ + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; \\cdots\\\\ - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; \\cdots\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots \\end{array}\\right| \\]\r\n\r\nCalculators capable of doing matrix algebra can also be used to evaluate determinants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nEvaluate the following determinants:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; b)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; c)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; d)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; -3\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; e)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; -3\\\\ -3 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right|.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers: Exercise 1\"]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,-1 &amp; b)\\,-3 &amp; c)\\,18 &amp; d)\\,3 &amp; e)\\,0\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nEvaluate the following determinants:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; b)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -3\\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; c)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -1 &amp; 5 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; -5 &amp; -6\\\\ -2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; d)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; 3 &amp; -3\\\\ 6 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; e)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; b &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c \\end{array}\\right|.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers: Exercise 2\"]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,-10 &amp; b)\\,40 &amp; c)\\,0 &amp; d)\\,-60 &amp; e)\\,abc\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M4 Determinant of a matrix (PDF 142KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"A determinant is a number that can be calculated for any square matrix.

We subtract \\(3R_{1}\\) from \\(R_{3}\\)to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-3R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 0 &amp; -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ -9 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we want a zero in row \\(3\\)column \\(2\\).

In example 2 we did that by interchanging rows. In this case, that won\u2019t work. However row \\(1\\) can be divided by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}'=R_{1}\/2\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ -2\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we proceed in the usual way. In this example we do not put in all the comments. \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-3R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-2R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=7R_{3}-8R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 23 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom \\(R_{3}\\)we have \\(23z=0\\) and so \\(z=0.\\) Substituting this into \\(R_{2}\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y-2z &amp; =7\\\\ 7y-2\\left(0\\right) &amp; =7\\\\ 7y &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(z=0,\\,y=1\\) into \\(R_{1}\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} x-y+z &amp; =-3\\\\ x-1+0 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=-2,\\,y=1,\\,z=0\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfinite number of solutions\r\nIn all the examples above we had a unique solution. That is, \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) were associated with a single number. It is possible that a set of simultaneous equations has an infinite number of solutions. Imagine after using row operations you get an augmented matrix like \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c\\\\ 0 &amp; e &amp; f\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} d\\\\ g\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In this case \\(R_{3}\\) tells us nothing. We basically have \\(2\\) equations and \\(3\\) unknowns. In this case we will have an infinite number of solutions and the variables \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) will be in terms of some parameter. The following example illustrates this case.\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the following set of equations: \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ 2x-y+z &amp; =5\\\\ 3x+2z &amp; =8. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSolution: The augmented matrix is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 5\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Performing row operations we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-3R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We can go no further with elementary row operations and so start back substitution. Row \\(3\\) tells us nothing. From row \\(2\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} -3y-z &amp; =-1\\\\ 3y+z &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] This is an equation with two unknowns. In this case we let one of the variables, either \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be free. That is we let \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be equal to some parameter \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). It doesn\u2019t matter which variable you choose to be free, though the answer will look different. We will set \\(z=t\\) then we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+z &amp; =1\\\\ 3y+t &amp; =1\\\\ 3y &amp; =1-t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1-t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(1\\) and substituting \\(z=t\\) and \\(y=\\left(1-t\\right)\/3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ x+\\frac{1-t}{3}+t &amp; =3\\\\ 3x+1-t+3t &amp; =9\\\\ 3x &amp; =8-2t\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution here is \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3},y=\\frac{1-t}{3},z=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] This gives us an infinite number of solutions because \\(t\\) can be any real number. To check the solution you can pick any value of \\(t,\\)determine \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) and substitute in the original equations. For example let \\(t=0\\).3 Here we took \\(t=0\\) because it is easy to get the corresponding \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values. But you can pick any value of \\(t\\). Once you choose \\(t\\), there will be a corresponding value of \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z.\\) These \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values will satisfy the original equations. Note that picking a value of \\(t\\) and checking if the corresponding \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values will the original equation is not a proof that your solution is correct. A real proof would have to consider all values of \\(t.\\) However it is a useful check. Then\\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{8}{3},y=\\frac{1}{3},z=0. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting in equation 1 gives \\[\\begin{align*} LHS &amp; =x+y+z\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}+0\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{3}\\\\ &amp; =3\\\\ &amp; =RHS. \\end{align*}\\] You can substitute into the second and third equation to check this solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nFind the solutions to the following systems of equations:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llcll} 1. &amp; x-y-2z=-6 &amp; \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad &amp; 2. &amp; 2x+y+2z=4\\\\ &amp; 2x-3y+3z=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 2x+4y-2z=6\\\\ &amp; 3x-y+4z=4 &amp; &amp; &amp; -y+3z=1 \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllccll} 3. &amp; x_{1}-x_{2}-2x_{3}=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\quad &amp; 4. &amp; x-2y+z-w=0\\\\ &amp; -3x_{1}+2x_{2}+4x_{3}=-3 &amp; \\quad &amp; \\quad &amp; &amp; &amp; 2x+4y-3z=0\\\\ &amp; 2x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=1 &amp; \\quad &amp; \\quad &amp; &amp; &amp; 3x+2y+2z-w=0 \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"]\r\n\r\n \t\\(x=-1,\\,y=1,\\,z=2\\)\r\n \t\\(x=0,\\,y=2,\\,z=1\\)\r\n \t\\(x_{1}=1,\\,x_{2}=-2,\\,x_{3}=1\\)\r\n \t\\(x=\\frac{1}{2}t,\\,y=-\\frac{1}{4}t,\\,z=0,\\,w=t\\)\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M6 Systems of equations (PDF 181KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Matrices can be used to solve systems of equations by using elementary row operations and the augmented matrix.

Find the most relevant databases for your area of study with Library Subject Guides.\n\n\n\n\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\n\nI got my first uni assignment and my lecturer told me to look in the library databases for journal articles. I was like \"the what\" but when I got to the university library, a librarian explained it to me She said first you have to get your head around academic journals. These aren't your dear diary journals, right. Academic journals are collections of articles written by experts in an academic discipline. They've usually been reviewed by other academics in the field who have said that the research is original and important and at a high standard. This means that if you use them you'll get better marks than if you use Wikipedia or a random website you found on Google. In the past, journals were always printed. Articles were written and collected in journals which were published at regular intervals. Libraries collected these and filled lots of shelves with them. Then the internet came along and changed the way journals were produced. Now they're more often found online as e-journals. Online e-journals are organized in library databases. A library database is like a bucket. Each holds a collection of e-journals. Some databases hold heaps of journals in them while others don't have that many. The university library subscribes to databases that focus on relevant subjects for RMIT students and researchers. No single database will have all the information you need so you need to find out which ones are best for what you're researching. The library has subject guides that show you which databases are best for your area. It's so much easier to find information when you know where to look and why.\n\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\n\n","excerpt":"This short video gives an explanation of library databases and how to use them from a student's perspective.

Like and Unlike Terms Like terms contain exactly the same pro-numerals1 A pro-numeral is a combination of letters, symbols and numbers. For example, \\(3x\\) is a pro-numeral. In algebra, when we write \\(3x\\) we really mean \\(3\\times x\\). Another example of a pro-numeral is \\(5ab\\). This means \\(5\\times a\\times b\\). Note that \\(5ab=5ba\\). The order of the letters and numbers is not important but usually we write numbers first and use alphabetical order for the letters. While \\(5ba\\) is correct, it is more common to write \\(5ab\\).. The following table gives some examples of like and unlike terms.    Like Terms Unlike Terms     \\(3x,5x\\) \\(3x,5y\\)   \\(2a,-3a\\) \\(3a,3\\)   \\(m^{2},7m^{2}\\) \\(m^{2},7m\\)   \\(2ab,3ab\\) \\(2a^{2}b,3ab^{2}\\)   \\(3xyz,5xyz\\) \\(3xyz,3xy\\)   \\(3ef,3fe\\) \\(3ef,\\,3eg\\)   \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\), \\(\\beta\\alpha\\) \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\), \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\)    For some practice, please go to Exercise 1 below.   Addition and Subtraction The essential rule is:   Only like terms may be added or subtracted.   Example 1. \\[\\begin{align*} 7e+10e &amp; =7\\times e+10\\times e\\\\ &amp; =\\left(7+10\\right)e\\\\ &amp; =17e. \\end{align*}\\] In practice we would not put in the first line. It is included to reinforce what \\(7e\\) and \\(10e\\) mean. In practice we would probably go straight to the answer. That is \\(7e+10e=17e\\). Example 2. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x^{2}-x^{2}-4x^{2} &amp; =\\left(3-1-4\\right)x^{2}\\\\ &amp; =-2x^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Example 3. 2 This example shows how we can gather different like terms. In this case \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 3m-4n+6m+n &amp; =\\left(3+6\\right)m+\\left(-4+1\\right)n\\\\ &amp; =9m-3n. \\end{align*}\\] Example 4. \\[\\begin{align*} 3a-b-5a+4ab-3b+ab &amp; =\\left(3-5\\right)a+\\left(-1-3\\right)b+\\left(4+1\\right)ab\\\\ &amp; =-2a-4b+5ab. \\end{align*}\\] Example 5. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-x^{2} &amp; \\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\end{align*}\\] Example 6. \\[\\begin{align*} p+2p-3 &amp; =3p-3. \\end{align*}\\] Example 7. \\[ 8uv+3u-10vu=-2uv+3u. \\] Example 8. \\[ 6r^{2}s-2rs^{2}\\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\] For some practice, please go to Exercise 2 below.   Multiplication Both like and unlike terms may be multiplied. When multiplying two or more terms consider: 1. The sign of the answer.3 In doing the multiplication, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the product. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\]  The product of the terms.  Here are some examples: \\[\\begin{array}{l} 1.\\quad\\left(-4\\right)\\times\\left(-3b\\right)=12b\\\\ 2.\\quad-2\\times6y=-12y\\\\ 3.\\quad2e\\times\\left(-5e^{2}\\right)=-10e^{3}\\\\ 4.\\quad\\left(-2u^{2}v\\right)\\times\\left(-4v\\right)=8u^{2}v^{2}\\\\ 5.\\quad-3pq\\times\\left(-2q\\right)\\times p=6p^{2}q^{2} \\end{array}\\]   Division In algebra, we often use fractions. For example:4 In this case the top term, 2 is called the numerator, the bottom term 5, is called the denominator and the horizontal line between them is called the fraction bar, division bar or vinculum. \\[ \\frac{2}{5}=2\\div5. \\] Similarly for algebraic terms: \\[ \\frac{2x^{2}yz}{3xy^{2}}=2x^{2}yz\\div3xy^{2}. \\] When dividing algebraic terms:  Rewrite as a fraction if necessary Expand any powers Establish the sign of the answer5 In doing the division, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the quotient. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Cancel any common factors   Examples  Divide \\(-12wyz\\) by \\(3yz\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} -12wyz\\div3yz &amp; =\\frac{-12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{determine sign}\\\\ &amp; =-4w\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\] Divide \\(2m^{2}n\\) by \\(-6mn^{2}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2m^{2}n\\div6mn^{2} &amp; =\\frac{2m^{2}n}{-6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2m^{2}n}{6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{m}{3n}. \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab &amp; =\\frac{6a^{2}\\times4ab}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{24a^{3}b}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{establish sign and expand powers}\\\\ &amp; =2a^{2}\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\] Divide \\(m+2\\) by \\(4m\\) \\[ \\left(m+2\\right)\\div4m=\\frac{m+2}{4m}. \\] There are no common factors and so it is not possible to simplify further.  For practice examples see Exercise 3.    Order of Operations The basic operations of arithmetic are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. Usually the order in which we perform the operations is important.  For example, what is the answer to the following arithmetic problem \\[ 4+3\\times2+5\\;? \\] At first sight there are several possible answers. Working from left to right we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times2+5\\\\ &amp; =14+5\\\\ &amp; =19. \\end{align*}\\] Working from right to left we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+3\\times7\\\\ &amp; =4+21\\\\ &amp; =25. \\end{align*}\\] If we do the multiplication first we get another answer: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\\\ &amp; =15. \\end{align*}\\] Yet another answer is obtained by doing the additions first: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times7\\\\ &amp; =49. \\end{align*}\\] Mathematicians don\u2019t like imprecision. In order to allow only one answer to the problem we perform operations in the following order:  Brackets Indices Multiplication and Division from left to right Addition and Subtraction  Using the first letters (bold) we get the abbreviation BIMDAS. Applying this rule the answer to our problem is \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\quad\\textrm{multiplication first}\\\\ &amp; =15\\quad\\textrm{then addition}. \\end{align*}\\]  Examples:  \\(3\\times2+4=6+4=10.\\) \\(3+2\\times4=3+8=11\\). \\(\\left(3+2\\right)\\times4=5\\times4=20.\\) \\(3-2^{2}=3-2\\times2=3-4=-1\\). \\(\\left(3-2\\right)^{2}=\\left(3-2\\right)\\times\\left(3-2\\right)=1\\times1=1\\). \\(3^{2}-2^{2}=3\\times3-2\\times2=9-4=5\\). \\(3st-3s\\times4t=3st-12st=-9st\\).  For some practice, see Exercise 4.    Exercise 1 Which of the five terms on the right is a like term with the term on the left? \\[\\begin{array}{llllllll} 1) &amp; 3x &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 2x &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 2xy &amp; 4x^{2}a\\\\ 2) &amp; 2ab &amp; | &amp; 2a &amp; 2b &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 6abc &amp; 12ab\\\\ 3) &amp; 2x^{2} &amp; | &amp; x &amp; 2x &amp; 5x^{2} &amp; 4x &amp; 4x^{3}\\\\ 4) &amp; 3xy^{2} &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 3xy &amp; 3x^{2}xy^{2} &amp; 3y^{2} &amp; 3y^{2}x\\\\ 5) &amp; 2m^{2}n &amp; | &amp; n &amp; mn^{2} &amp; 8mn &amp; 2m^{2} &amp; 4nm^{2}\\\\ 6) &amp; 4ab^{2}c &amp; | &amp; 4 &amp; 2ab^{2}c &amp; 4abc &amp; 8b^{2}c &amp; 4cba \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 2 Simplify each of the following: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 1. &amp; &amp; a)\\;13x+4-3x-1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;10mn+5m+12mn+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;3xy^{2}+2xy+5xy^{2}+3xy &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;5xy+6m-2xy-2m\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;x+y+2x-y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3a+5b-a-6b\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;x+4y-x-2y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;7x-4m-5x-3m\\\\ &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-5x-3y+5x &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\] Simplify each of the following: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 2. &amp; &amp; a)\\;13x+4-3x-1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;10mn+5m+12mn+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;3xy^{2}+2xy+5xy^{2}+3xy &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;5xy+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;x+y+2x-y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3a+5b-a-6b\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;x+4y-x-2y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;7x-4m-5x-3m\\\\ &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-4x-3y+5x &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 3 Simplify the following algebraic expressions: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 1. &amp; &amp; a)\\;5\\times2k &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;4a\\times3ab\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;y\\times3y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;4m\\times\\left(-3mn\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;m\\times39\\times5 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;2ab\\times3bc\\times\\left(-4\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;2ab^{2}\\times3ac &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4m\\times\\left(-5kmp\\right)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 2. &amp; &amp; a)\\;18ef\\div6f &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;-100uvw\\div100w\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;24gh^{2}\\div8gh &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;3m^{2}n\\div12mn^{2}\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;rs\\times2st\\div2s &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3jk\\times12km\\div9jkm\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;10p\\times3qp\\div16pq &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4yz\\times5w^{2}z\\div10wy \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 4 Simplify the following expressions: \\[\\begin{array}{lllll} 1)\\;18\\times\\left(3\\times\\left(-5\\right)\\right) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 2)\\;3\\times\\left(-4\\right)+\\left(8\\times2\\right)\\\\ 3)\\;10-5^{2}+3 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 4)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}+3\\\\ 5)\\;10^{2}-5^{2} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 6)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}\\\\ 7)\\;3m+2\\times3m &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 8)\\;6ab-3a\\times4b\\\\ 9)\\;16gh-4gh\\times4 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 10)\\;9b-3b\\times2k+2k\\times b \\end{array}\\]   [lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers\"] Exercise 1 \\[\\begin{array}{lllllllllllllll} 1.\\;2x &amp; &amp; 2.\\;12ab &amp; &amp; 3.\\;5x^{2} &amp; &amp; 4.\\;xy^{2} &amp; &amp; 5.\\;4nm^{2} &amp; &amp; 6.\\;2ab^{2}c\\end{array}\\] Exercise 2 \\[\\begin{array}{llllllllll} 1. &amp; a)\\;8x &amp; &amp; b)\\;5x &amp; &amp; c)\\;20xy &amp; &amp; d)\\;6mn &amp; &amp; e)\\;7abc\\\\ &amp; f)\\;-12mg &amp; &amp; g)\\;13x &amp; &amp; h)\\;7ab &amp; &amp; i)\\;-6m &amp; &amp; j)\\;12xy\\\\ \\\\ 2. &amp; a)\\;10x+3 &amp; &amp; b)\\;22mn+11m &amp; &amp; c)\\;8xy^{2}+5xy &amp; &amp; d)\\;3xy+4m &amp; &amp; e)\\;3x\\\\ &amp; f)\\;2a-b &amp; &amp; g)\\;2Y &amp; &amp; h)\\;2x-7m &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-3y &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\] Exercise 3 \\[\\begin{array}{llllllll} 1. &amp; a)\\;10k &amp; &amp; b)\\;12a^{2}b &amp; &amp; c)\\;3y^{2} &amp; &amp; d)\\;-12m^{2}n\\\\ &amp; e)\\;15mp &amp; &amp; f)\\;-24ab^{2}c &amp; &amp; g)\\;6a^{2}b^{2}c &amp; &amp; h)\\;-20km^{2}p\\\\ \\\\ 2. &amp; a)\\;3e &amp; &amp; b)\\;-uv &amp; &amp; c)\\;3h &amp; &amp; d)\\;m\/4n\\\\ &amp; e)\\;rst &amp; &amp; f)\\;4k &amp; &amp; g)\\;15p\/8 &amp; &amp; h)\\;2wz^{2} \\end{array}\\] Exercise 4 \\[\\begin{array}{lllllllll} 1.\\;3 &amp; &amp; 2.\\;4 &amp; &amp; 3.\\;-12 &amp; &amp; 4.\\;28 &amp; &amp; 5.\\;75\\\\ 6.\\;25 &amp; &amp; 7.\\;9m &amp; &amp; 8.\\;-6ab &amp; &amp; 9.\\;0 &amp; &amp; 10.\\;9b-4bk \\end{array}\\] [\/lightweight-accordion]      Download this page, A1.1 Algebraic Operations (PDF 231KB)   ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1345 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Keywords(tags): A page from Al-Khwarizmis \u201cal-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-gabr wa-l-muqabala\u201d, an early book on algebra.

Force equals mass times acceleration. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\r\nDo you need to learn about Newton's first three laws? This page will help your understanding of these laws and explain applications for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Newton\u2019s first 3 laws?\r\n\r\n \tAn object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\r\n \tForce \\(\\left(F\\right)\\) equals mass \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) times acceleration \\(\\left(a\\right)\\). That is \\(F=ma\\).\r\n \tFor every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNet (sum of the forces or resultant) force is represented by \\(\\Sigma F\\)\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Right \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the right\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Left \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the left\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-150=0\\) Newton \\(\\therefore\\) balanced force so is stationary or moving at a constant speed\r\n\r\nNo acceleration but could be at rest or moving at constant velocity (remember F=ma so no acceleration but it could be moving)\r\nNote : Force is a vector quantity, so direction must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton's 1st law of motion\r\nEvery object continues to be at rest, or continues with constant velocity, unless it experiences an unbalanced force.\r\n\r\nSeatbelts are fitted in cars to take into account Newton's 1st Law of Motion. If, for instance, you had to brake suddenly and you were not wearing your seatbelt, then by Newton's 1st Law, you would continue to travel at a uniform speed \u2013 the speed of the car just before braking \u2013 until you made contact with the windscreen. That is, the sum of the forces acting on you was zero at the instant you braked even though the car was being acted upon by a braking force. The windscreen would then exert a force on you as you hit it. As it did to the author of this worksheet when he was 13 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton's 2nd law of motion\r\nThis law relates to the (sum of \\(\\Sigma\\) ) the (forces F) written as \\(\\Sigma F\\) s acting on an object and the acceleration produced as a consequence of this resultant force. It is given by:\r\nSum of the Forces = \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\)\r\nwhere \\(\\Sigma F\\) is the sum of the forces (in Newtons), \u2018m\u2019 is the mass of the object (in\\(kg\\)), and \u2018a\u2019 is the acceleration (in \\(ms^{-2}\\)). Note: \\(\\Sigma F\\) must have the same direction as acceleration as force is also a vector.\r\n\r\nWhen doing Newton's 2nd law problems, draw all forces acting on the object in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nA toy car of mass \\(2kg\\) has a driving force \\(F_{D}\\) of \\(20N\\). The frictional force \\(F_{F}\\) acting on the car is \\(10Newton\\). Find the cars acceleration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe net force acting on the car is the driving force minus the frictional force: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =F_{D}-F_{F}\\\\ &amp; =20-10\\\\ &amp; =10N. \\end{align*}\\] Using Newton\u2019s 2nd law1 The second law is: \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} ma &amp; =10\\\\ 2a &amp; =10\\\\ a &amp; =5ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] The magnitude of the car\u2019s acceleration is \\(5ms^{-2}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton\u2019s 3rd law of motion\r\nWhen two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal in size, but opposite in direction. These pairs of forces are called action-reaction forces.\r\n\r\nYou need to appreciate that each force in the action-reaction pair acts on different objects. This is different to Newton's 2nd law where you analyze forces that are acting on the same object. Note that each force is equal in size but opposite in direction to its paired force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal force \\(F_{N}\\)\r\nA normal force acts at right angles to the surface with which it is in contact. For instance, if you are currently sitting on a chair reading this handout, then the chair is in contact with the floor and so there is a contact force of the chair acting on the floor given by \\(F_{CF}\\). By Newton's 3rd law the floor will exert an equal but opposite force on the chair of \\(F_{FC}\\). \\(F_{FC}\\) is also called the normal force \\(F_{N}\\). If this is not the case then you will either fall through the floor or fly up into the sky. See diagram below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(F_{FC}=\\) \\(-\\) \\(F_{CF}\\) where the negative sign indicates that these forces are acting in opposite directions. Recall your notes on vectors. The magnitude of the forces are equal but the direction is opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplications of Newton's laws\r\nA starting point when analyzing Newton's 2nd law problems is to draw all forces acting on the object in question.\r\n\r\nObjects in lifts\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIf accelerating down (as shown): \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ mg-F &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAccelerating down then gravity is winning or larger. Accelerating up then Normal force is winning or larger. Acceleration has magnitude and is directional , it is a vector. where \\(g\\) is the acceleration of gravity (see diagram)\r\n\r\n \tIf accelerating up: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIf not accelerating at all:2 It is stationary or moving at a constant velocity. \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N} &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjects bouncing\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the bounce (the instant the ball is in contact with the surface):\r\n\r\n \t\\(F_{N}\\) &gt; mg, because a &gt; 0 and is upwards.

Be careful with negative and positive signs!\r\n \tIf, for instance, the two cars collide and stay together after the collision, then the momentum of the two cars before the collision is equal to the momentum of the lockedtogether cars after the collision.\r\n \tMathematically, problems on collisions or explosions are similar, except that for an explosion, the momentum of the system before the blast is often zero.\r\n \tIn closed systems no external forces act. For example, a spacecraft colliding in deep space experiences no external force because there is no gravitational field. Systems close to the Earths surface are systems that are not closed because the external force acting is the Earths gravitational force. To make them closed one has to include the Earth as part of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMomentum transfer involving the Earth\r\nThe following two situations describe how momentum is transferred to the Earth.\r\n\r\n \tA ball is thrown up: it rises against gravity and then slows down and stops, losing momentum due to the earth.

Describing these motions require some technical terms such as displacement, distance, velocity, speed and acceleration. The terms and their relationships to one another are described in this module.\r\n\r\n\r\nScalar and vector quantities\r\nQuantities that have only a magnitude and no specified direction are called scalar quantities. Examples are time, speed and distance. Quantities that have both magnitude and direction are called vector quantities. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. We discuss these below.\r\n\r\nDisplacement \\(\\left(x\\right)\\)\r\nWhen an object is moved from one point to another it is said to be displaced. If we move to Dandenong we can say we have been displaced \\(32\\,km\\) from Melbourne, but to define our position, we need to specify a direction and say we are \\(32\\,km\\) South East of Melbourne. That is we give a magnitude (\\(32\\,km\\)) and a direction (South East). Consequently displacement is a vector quantity.\r\n\r\nNote that displacement is often referred to as position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistance \\(\\left(d\\right)\\)\r\nDistance is the magnitude (size) of the displacement, but has no direction so it is a scalar quantity. For example you can say my distance is \\(60\\,km\\) away, but your displacement is \\(60\\,km\\) in a direction - such as \\(60\\,km\\) West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVelocity \\(\\left(v\\right)\\)\r\nVelocity \\(v\\) is the rate of change of displacement \\(x\\). That is, for an object moving at constant velocity, \\[\\begin{align*} v &amp; =\\frac{x}{t} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is the time taken. Since displacement is a vector quantity, so is velocity. The units of velocity depend on the units of displacement and time. If displacement is in metres \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) and time is in seconds \\(\\left(s\\right)\\) the unit of velocity is metres per second and is written as \\(m\/s\\) or \\(ms^{-1}.\\) 1 Note that \\(m\/s\\) is metres divided by seconds. The notation \\(ms^{-1}\\) uses indicial notation. Here \\(s^{-1}=1\/s\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} ms^{-1} &amp; =m\\times s^{-1}\\\\ &amp; =m\\times\\frac{1}{s}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{s}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed\r\nThe speed of an object is the magnitude (size) of it\u2019s velocity.

That is \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{v}{t}. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(v\\) is in metres per second, the unit of acceleration is metres per second per second2 The notation \\(ms^{-2}\\) uses indicial notation.

In this case, the speed is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{speed} &amp; =\\frac{d}{t}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{12}{2}\\\\ &amp; =6\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisplacement vs time graphs\r\nConsider the graph below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this is displacement (a vector quantity) versus time. Whereas the gradient of the distance versus time graph gave speed, the gradient of the displacement (a vector) versus time graph gives velocity (a vector).\r\n\r\nLooking at the graph, from A to B the object is moving at a constant velocity (because the graph is a straight line). Its velocity \\(v\\) is the gradient of the line from A to B. That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{B$-displacement\\;at\\;A$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{B$-time\\;at\\;\\text{A}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-0}{2-0}\\\\ &amp; =4\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNow consider what happens from B to C. There is no change in displacement and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{C$-displacement\\;at\\;B$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{C$-time\\;at\\;\\text{B}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-8}{3-2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{1}\\,m\/s\\\\ &amp; =0\\,m\/s \\end{align*}\\] That is, the object has a velocity of \\(0\\,m\/s\\) between B and C.\r\n\r\nNow consider what happens from C to D. The displacement decreases from \\(8\\) to \\(0\\) over a time of \\(1\\,s.\\) So the velocity is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{D$-displacement\\;at\\;C$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{D$-time\\;at\\;\\text{C}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-8}{4-3}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{8}{1}\\\\ &amp; =-8\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\] This means the object has reversed (due to the negative sign) its direction and is moving at a SPEED of \\(8\\,m\/s.\\)\r\n\r\nAt D, the object has returned to its starting position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVelocity vs time graphs\r\nThe velocity-time graph below shows a car which accelerates uniformly from rest to \\(60\\,m\/s\\) in \\(20\\,s,\\)then travels at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) for the next \\(10\\,s\\), then decelerates uniformly to rest in \\(30\\,s.\\) The total journey took \\(60\\,s.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the object accelerates from \\(0\\,m\/s\\) to \\(60\\,m\/s\\). From \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the object is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) and from \\(C\\) to \\(D,\\)the object is slowing down from \\(60\\,m\/s.\\) We now look at some features of the graph in detail. In particular we look at the area under the graph and it\u2019s gradient.\r\n\r\nArea under velocity time graph\r\nConsider the units of the area. The area is the product of the velocity and time and so the units are \\(m\/s\\,\\times s=m.\\) That is, the area under the graph gives displacement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement.\r\n\r\nThe area under a speed-time graph gives distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the velocity time graph above. The area has been divided into three regions, \\(1,2\\) and \\(3.\\) Let area of each region be \\(A_{1},A_{2}\\) and \\(A_{3},\\)respectively. We have:4 Remember that the area of a triangle \\(A_{t}\\) is half \\(\\times\\)base \\(\\times\\) height and the area of a rectangle \\(A_{r}\\) is base \\(\\times\\) height. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} A_{t} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}bh\\\\ A_{r} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =bh. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} A_{1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times20\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{2} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =10\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{3} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times30\\times60\\\\ &amp; =900\\,m. \\end{align*}\\] The total displacement is therefore \\(A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}=600+600+900=2100\\,m.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradient of a velocity-time graph\r\nThe gradient (or slope)5 The gradient \\(m,\\) of a linear (straight line) graph is the rise divided by the run. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}. \\end{align*}\\] of a Velocity-Time graph gives the acceleration of the object.\r\n\r\nConsider the velocity-time graph above. From \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) the gradient of the graph is \\(m_{AB}\\) where \\[\\begin{align*} m_{AB} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-0}{20-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60}{20}\\\\ &amp; =3\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the car is increasing its speed by \\(3\\,m\/s\\) each second.\r\n\r\nFrom \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{BC} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-60}{30-20}=\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{10}\\\\ &amp; =0\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is the car is not accelerating but is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s.\\)\r\n\r\nFrom \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{CD} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-60}{60-30}=\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{60}{30}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the negative value of acceleration indicates the car is slowing down. We say the car is decelerating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther examples\r\n1. A car accelerates from a stationary position. The rate of acceleration is constant6 If acceleration is constant we also use the expression \u201cthe acceleration is uniform\u201d. . Sketch graphs of the acceleration against time, the velocity against time and the displacement against time.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThe acceleration-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is simply a horizontal line as the acceleration is constant.\r\nThe velocity-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a linear graph. The gradient (slope) of the graph is the acceleration.\r\nThe displacement-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a curve. The gradient (slope) at any point on the curve is the velocity at that time. You can find the approximate value of the gradient by drawing a tangent at the point of interest and then calculating the gradient of the tangent.7 If you know the functional form of the displacement, then you can differentiate it to find the gradient at any time. For example, if \\[\\begin{align*} x\\left(t\\right) &amp; =3t^{2}-2t+1 \\end{align*}\\] then the gradient is \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =6t-2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n2. A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\). Sketch and describe the graph of velocity of the ball against time from the moment it is thrown to the moment it touches the ground. Ignore air resistance.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst define the coordinate system you want to work in. We take upwards velocity as positive and downwards velocity as negative. Once the ball is thrown up, the only force acting on it is gravity which is constant. So from the previous example, the graph of velocity against time is linear. That is, a straight line. As gravity acts downwards, the velocity against time graph must have a negative gradient (because the ball is decelerating). So a velocity-time graph looks like the one below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we need to describe it. Think about what has happened. Initially the ball is thrown into the air vertically upwards (positive direction) with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\). Point \\(A\\) describes the initial velocity (upward) that the ball has. It is \\(5\\,m\/s\\) upward.\r\nThen the ball starts to slow down (due to gravity acting on it). This is the part of the graph from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). At point \\(B,\\) the ball has zero velocity. It is not moving, and so this is the point of maximum altitude for the ball.\r\nAfter \\(B,\\) the ball has a negative velocity. That means it is now heading downwards towards the point from which it was thrown. Point \\(C\\) represents the starting position. At this point the ball has the same speed8 Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. At point \\(A\\) the velocity was \\(5\\,m\/s\\) upward. At point \\(C\\) the velocity is \\(-5\\,m\/s\\) or \\(5\\,m\/s\\) downward. Remember, a vector quantity has to have a magnitude and a direction.  as it had at point \\(A.\\) This is shown in the diagram below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe relationships between various graphs and their gradient and the area below them are summarized in the table below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph type\r\nDisplacement vs time\r\nVelocity vs time\r\nAcceleration vs time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradient\r\nVelocity\r\nAcceleration\r\nNo Meaning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArea under graph\r\nNo Meaning\r\nDisplacement\r\nChange in velocity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \tThe graph below shows the position of a dancer moving in a straight line across a stage.\r\nThe dancer\u2019s movements are designated by sections \\(A\\) to \\(D.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhat was the starting position of the dancer?\r\n \tIn which of the sections (\\(A\\) - \\(D)\\) is the dancer at rest?\r\n \tIn which of the sections is the dancer moving in a positive direction?\r\n \tIn which of the sections is the dancer moving with a negative velocity?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe graph below represents the straight line motion of a radio-controlled toy car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe, in words, the motion of the car.\r\n \tWhat was the position of the car after i) \\(2\\,s\\) ii) \\(4\\,s\\) iii) \\(6\\,s\\) iv) \\(10\\,s\\) ?\r\n \tAt what time did the car return to its starting point?\r\n \tWhat was the velocity of the car\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) during the first \\(2\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)ii) after \\(3\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)iii) from \\(4\\,s\\) to \\(6\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)iv) at \\(8\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad v)\\) from \\(8\\,s\\) to \\(9\\,s\\) ?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDuring its \\(10\\,s\\) motion, what was the car\u2019s\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) distance traveled?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)ii) displacement?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe following position-time graph is for a cyclist traveling along a straight road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe the motion of the cyclist in words.\r\n \tWhat was the velocity of the cyclist during the first \\(30\\,s\\)?\r\n \tWhat was the cyclist\u2019s velocity during the final \\(10\\,s\\)?\r\n \tCalculate the cyclist\u2019s instantaneous velocity at \\(35\\,s.\\)\r\n \tWhat was the average velocity of the cyclist between \\(30\\,s\\) and \\(40\\,s\\)?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhich of the velocity-time graphs \\(A\\) to \\(E\\) best represents the motion of:\r\n\r\n\r\n \ta car coming to a stop at a traffic light?\r\n \ta swimmer moving at a constant speed?\r\n \ta cyclist accelerating from rest with constant acceleration?\r\n \ta car accelerating from rest and changing through its gears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe following graph shows the motion of a dog running along a footpath in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe the motion of the dog during these sections of the graph:\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) A\\(\\quad\\;\\)ii) B\\(\\quad\\;\\)iii) C\\(\\quad\\;\\)iv) D\\(\\quad\\;\\)v) E\\(\\quad\\;\\)vi) F.\r\n \tCalculate the displacement of the dog after:\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) \\(2\\,s\\quad\\;\\)ii) \\(7\\,s\\quad\\;\\)iii) \\(10\\,s.\\)\r\n \tPlot a position-time graph of the dog\u2019s motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe straight line motion of a train is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tHow long does the train take to reach its cruising speed?\r\n \tWhat is the acceleration of the train \\(10\\,s\\) after starting.\r\n \tWhat is the acceleration of the train \\(40\\,s\\) after starting?\r\n \tWhat is the displacement of the train after \\(120\\,s\\) ?\r\n\r\nHint for b.9 You can only approximate this.

A vector has both a size (called its magnitude) and a direction. This module explains how vectors may be added together.\r\n\r\nScalars and Vectors\r\nMany physical quantities can be classified into one of two groups: scalars or vectors.\r\n\r\nScalar quantities are completely defined by a magnitude and the relevant unit. For example, a time period may be expressed as 10 seconds. The magnitude is 10, the unit is seconds and there is no direction associated with a time period, so time is a scalar quantity.\r\n\r\nVector quantities require magnitude and direction and the relevant unit. For example, suppose I walk in a Northerly direction for 200 metres. The magnitude is 200, the direction is North and the unit is metres. So my walk is a vector quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nSome examples of vector and scalar quantities are shown below:\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Quantity\r\nScalar\r\nVector\r\nExample of Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\nseconds, hours, days, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\ndistance\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\ncentimeters, metres, kilometres etc.\r\n\r\n\r\ndisplacement\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n100 metres North, 50 metres in the \\(x\\)-direction\r\n\r\n\r\ntemperature\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(45^{\\circ}\\) Celsius\r\n\r\n\r\nspeed\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n100 kilometres per hour, 3 metres per second\r\n\r\n\r\nvelocity\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n100 kilometres per hour, South; 3 \\(ms^{-1}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis\r\n\r\n\r\nvoltage\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n250 millivolts DC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresenting Vector Quantities\r\nVectors are drawn by an arrow, whose length varies with the magnitude of the vector (drawn to scale!) and which points in the appropriate direction. For example, suppose North is up the page, South is down, East is to the right and West is to the left. \\(A\\) vector from a point \\(A\\) to a point \\(B\\) (East of \\(A\\)) representing a distance of 10 metres could be shown as in the diagram below1 We call \\(A\\) the tail of the vector and \\(B\\) the head of the vector., East is assumed to be positive so the arrow points towards \\(B\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the same scale, a vector representing a distance of 2 metres to the west of A could be represented by:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning and end of a vector may be identified by letters such as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as above. In such cases the vector may be referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\). The arrow above the letters signifies that the quantity \\(AB\\) is a vector but does not point in the direction of the vector.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted a vector of magnitude 10 meters pointing West it would look like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vector is referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}.\\) Note that \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}=-\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}. \\] In other words, multiplying a vector by \\(-1\\) changes the direction of the vector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnitude of a Vector\r\nSometimes we want to use only the magnitude (size) of a particular vector. In such cases, to distinguish that it is only the magnitude that is being used, we use the modulus sign \\(\\left|\\right|\\). So for the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\) above we would have \\[ \\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|=10\\textrm{ metres} \\] as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,}\\) represented a distance of 10 metres to the East.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tThe magnitude of a vector representing a velocity of 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\)in a southerly direction is 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\).\r\n \tThe magnitude of a force of 18 Newtons in a Westerly direction is 18 Newtons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Vectors\r\nTwo vectors are added by placing the tail of the second vector at the head off the first and drawing an arrow from the tail of the first to the head of the second. For example we will add a vector that is 2 metres to the east to another vector that is 5 metres to the east. The two vectors to be added together are shown in red and the resulting vector is shown in blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can write this algebraically as: \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}. \\] The vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}\\) is called the resultant and in this case is a vector of magnitude 7 metres in an Easterly direction.\r\n\r\nWe can also add vectors that are in North and South directions. For example if we add a vector representing 2 metres South to a vector representing 4 meters North we get:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that the vector to the South is shown pointing downwards as we assume North is up. The result is a vector (shown in red) of length 2 meters pointing North. We could write this as\r\n\r\n\\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,} \\] as before.\r\n\r\nNow add a vector of 3 meters to the North to another of 4 meters to the East:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resultant vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\) is shown in red. It\u2019s magnitude may be found using Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem:2 Note that the angle \\(\\widehat{BCD}\\) or \\(\\widehat{BAD}\\) is 90 degrees and so Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem can be used.  \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{\\left|\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}+\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{9+16}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{25}\\\\ &amp; =5. \\end{align*}\\] The direction my be found by calculating the angle \\(\\widehat{CBD}\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\widehat{CBD} &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =53.13^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] So the resultant vector has a magnitude of 5 metres in a direction North \\(53.13\\) degrees East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n1.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km East\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km West.\r\n2.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{40\\,\\,}\\)km North\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km South.\r\n3.

For example, a time period may be expressed as 10 seconds. The magnitude is 10, the unit is seconds and there is no direction associated with a time period, so time is a scalar quantity. Vector quantities require magnitude and direction [&hellip;]","date":"16 October 2023","link":"https:\/\/lab.bitma.app\/maths-statistics\/vectors\/pv11-addition-vectors\/"},{"id":2980,"title":"T1 Pythagoras\u2019 theorem","content":"\r\nPythagoras\u2019 theorem shows the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.

Let\u2019s start with the definition of a right angled triangle first. It\u2019s a triangle with one angle that\u2019s 90 degrees, the longer side is opposite the right angle and is called the hypotenuse. Now let\u2019s state Pythagoras\u2019 theorem. It states that for any right angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse, h, is equal to the sum of the squares on the two shorter sides, a and b. In other words, h2 equals a2 plus b2.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do an example. Let\u2019s find the length of the hypotenuse of this particular triangle. We\u2019re given the two shorter sides, a and b, so write the formula first a the top, h2 equals a2 plus b2 and substitute in for a and b, four and three. So we have 42 plus 32. Notice 42 is four times four, not four times two. So four time four is 16, 32 is three times three which is nine. So h2 equals 25. So if h2 is 25, then h is the square root of 25, which is five. In other words, the length of the hypotenuse is five.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s find the length of one of the shorter sides of the triangle. Here we want to find the length of a. We\u2019re given the hypotenuse. So as before we substitute into the formula, but notice I\u2019ve turned the formula around this time and you\u2019ll see why in a moment. In other words, I\u2019ve got a2 plus b2 equals h2. Substituting b is six, h is 10, so a2 plus 36 equals 100. Now I want to remove 36 from the left hand side to isolate a. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve turned the formula around this time, to make it easier, \u2018cause I\u2019m leaving a on the left hand side. So I\u2019m subtracting 36, but remember we must subtract from both sides. So 36 minus 36 on the left hand side, 100 minus 36 on the right hand side. Therefore a2 equals 64, from which a is the square root of 64, which is eight. So the length of side a is 8.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at the last triangle and we want to find the length of b, which is sometimes called the perpendicular side, because it\u2019s at right angles to another side, in this case, a. a will be the horizontal line, b will be the perpendicular line, and the angle between the two will be 90 degrees. So substituting into the formula as before, we have a equals 24, and h is 25. The numbers are a bit larger but it still doesn\u2019t change the method by which we\u2019re doing the problem. So 242 plus b2 equals 252. 576 is 24 times 24, plus b2 equals 625, which is 25 times 25. And as before we remove the number from the left hand side to isolate the b. So we subtract 576 from the right hand side. 625 minus 576 gives us 49. If b2 equals 49 b is now the square root of 49 which is seven. In other words. The length of side b is seven.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight angled triangles\r\nTriangles are plane shapes with three straight sides.

Whether consciously or not, we tend to study and imitate those who already belong to the club &ndash; whether it's a banner carrying activist; a leather clad bikey or a cyclist in lycra; we try to behave the way they do, dress the way they do, acquire the right accessories, learn the accepted language and, above all, act as if it all comes naturally. Take on an identity In short, when we want to 'belong' to a group we try very hard to learn how to belong, that is how to fit in and be accepted by the existing members of the group. Some people refer to this as trying to 'take on an identity'. If young students are surrounded by friends and fellow students who seem at home 'texting' one another, then they are probably going to try and become one of them and take on a 'texter' identity. They are likely to purchase the phone, whatever seems the most popular at the time (not the one their parents think they should have because its cheaper) and quickly focus on learning to use it as their friends do: learning to 'talk the talk' of the texters. Similar learning takes place for those who want to enter the more specialist worlds of 'Pokemon' or 'Dungeons and Dragons'.  Wanting to belong motivates you to learn! Clubs &ndash; identity &ndash; language Think of a sport or hobby that you are into. Think of the rules and behaviours, both official and unofficial, that make up its special culture and how you learned them. In other words, how you took on the identity of a player or became a member of that group. For example, if you were to take up golf, there is an enormous number of rules to learn as well as acceptable behaviours &ndash; where to leave your buggy when playing a shot so you don't get in the way of other people, when an where you can speak on the course, and how loudly is acceptable. There is also an enormous amount of special knowledge and language that golfers need to know. How do you learn all of this and why? You may have acquired it easily as you grew up in a golfing family, or like me, you may have to learn it later because you want to play the sport. It is wanting to play the sport that makes you put the effort into learning. And your new learning will be added to a whole collection of existing knowledge and languages (literacies) that you already bring to the golf lessons.  Learn how to 'talk the talk' Different groups, different identities, different literacies We have all probably taken on a number of different identities or learned to fit into a number of different groups in our lives: families, local cultures, political groups, hobby or sporting groups and the professional worlds in which we work. Sometimes, as we move from one group to another, we have to switch identities. We have to behave differently, wear different clothes and even use different language in order to fit in. The combination of knowledge, behaviours and language (the literacies) that we have acquired in the course of becoming part of these groups or taking on these identities, forms the unique person that each of us is now.   How does this relate to VET teaching? There are two aspects that are useful to consider from this discussion. First, that learning within a VET program can be seen as taking on a new professional 'identity' in order to be accepted in the workplace, and along with it the specialist language and literacy that is part of that identity. Secondly, that it is good for us as VET teachers to remember that both teachers and students bring different identities, expertise and 'literacies' to any learning situation. It is probably a good idea to acknowledge this and to open up the possibility that the teacher and students can learn different things from one another as they go about the task of learning the specialist language of the vocational field.  Specialist language in VET Every profession, trade or vocational area has its own specialist language and literacy. This includes particular terminology: special words, phrases, acronyms and even slang terms that make up the everyday talk of people in the field. Some people call it 'jargon', often in a derogatory tone which implies that it shouldn't be used. However, the reality is that every profession and trade does use its own unique language. Literacy people tend to refer to the 'discourse or specialist 'register' of the field (vocational area). Some also refer to 'multiliteracies' to highlight the range of 'literacies' needed for different occupations or pursuits. Part of introducing students to the new field is helping them to become literate in its specialist language. That means helping them to learn the meanings of new terms as well as they way in which they are commonly used when writing and speaking within the trade or profession. Borrowed language &ndash; new meanings for old words Often specialist language contains lots of terms from everyday English which are given entirely different meanings in the new language. For example, think about the first thing that comes to mind when you see the word 'cookie' (apart from the fact that this is another US addition to the universal English language). Then consider alternative meanings that it has in different professions. Whilst 'a baker bakes cookies' an IT technician could stop a cookie from being transmitted over the internet, and a photographer uses a cookie as an attachment on a light stand (ANTA 2002). If you think further into slang or colloquial expressions then you might also be familiar with the idea of a person who 'has his hands in the cookie jar' meaning that he is stealing from his organisation or team.  'Cookie' - One word many meanings Try your own instinctive reaction to these examples: volume, surfing, power. Then compare your initial thoughts to the comments below.  Volume: Whilst most people will relate to the sound switch on the TV, radio or CD player, and librarians might instantly conjure up part of a series of books, mathematics teachers always seem to assume that students instantly make the mental shift to their world in which volume is automatically the amount that a container can hold . Surfing: Your instinctive reaction to this term depends on the era you grew up in. To my mother 'surf' was a brand of soap powder. A few years ago 'surfing' would instantly conjure up images of a sport, (a fairly male dominated one) involving boards, wetsuits, vans, and a mysterious language of its own (with words like 'bombora' and 'pipeline', waves that were 'hairy' (which was good) or 'dumpers' (which were bad) and vehicles which were ____________ wagons. These days many more people of all ages are 'surfing' the web, a phrase that was meaningless to most of us a mere decade ago. Power: Again it has many meaning according to your vocational field. In maths it is another word for an index as in '2 to the power 3 equals 8'. In science, engineering or mechanics it relates to energy generation, in sociology or politics it is about our ability to influence or control others. As well economists talk of 'purchasing power'.  Specialist meanings in different contexts Consider the amount of borrowed language in this excerpt from a student's learning resource.  'a hard soldered type elbow or tee with an external nipple is silver brazed to the copper tube to provide a threaded water connection point' Although a plumber might not give this sentence a second thought, others outside the trade (not members of the club) see a sentence loaded with familiar English language words which obviously must have specialist meanings in the particular context. In this case we outsiders can probably guess the meanings, or at least some approximation, because we can assume visual similarities, but we still need to read it several times and certainly could not guarantee any confident understanding. These kinds of words and phrases often act as barriers to learning for students. New terms that they don't understand can discourage learners from non English speaking backgrounds but also native English speakers who lack confidence in their ability (perhaps because of poor experiences in the school system). Specialist language that is not introduced gradually and given some focus within their regular learning (class teaching or written materials) can prevent them from understanding or even feeling a sense of belonging to their chosen vocational area.

A recent study from a prominent Australian university discovered that the emotional toll of being \u2018cancelled\u2019 is causing every-day Australians severe anguish. In fact, the study revealed that 78.7% of people are so worried that they will be \u2018cancelled\u2019 that they are now fearful to speak their minds in a public forum.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why the VCP will be introducing a bill to Parliament this week that proposes changes to our current Freedom of Speech laws.

Join us and we can get this country back on track.\r\nPersuasive language analysis\r\nThe author of The cost of change uses a number of persuasive techniques to influence the reader, such as:\r\n\r\n \tEmotional appeal: The author taps into feelings of nostalgia and fear, suggesting that people are losing satisfaction with the direction of society by mentioning \"severe anguish\" and \"fearful to speak\".\r\n \tBandwagon: Phrases like \"unless you have been living under a rock\" suggest that the issues are universally acknowledged, encouraging readers to align with the majority.\r\n \tStatistics: The use of a specific percentage (78.7%) from a \"recent study\" attempts to add credibility. However, the specific source is not mentioned, and the author tells us the information came from a \"prominent Australian university.\"\r\n \tAppeal to authority: The article references \"many experts in the area of anthropology\" to support the argument but does not mention who the experts are.\r\n \tFear of consequences: The text warns of a \"left-leaning political agenda\" and suggests that conservative values are under threat, urging immediate action.\r\n \tCall to action: The author strongly encourages readers to \"petition your local member of Parliament,\" creating a sense of urgency.\r\n \tRidicule\/attack: The term \"wannabe socialists\" is used to ridicule and discredit opponents, framing them as a threat to traditional values. The phrase \u201ceveryone has something to complain about\u201d suggests that people who do not hold the same view as the author somehow lack resilience.\r\n\r\n[attribution id=\"attr\"][\/attribution]","excerpt":"Understanding how the persuasive language authors use can help us to understand their potential motivations and biases.

Understanding these can help you make more informed choices in your research.\r\n\r\n \tOpinion pieces: These are based on personal views and may lack factual support. For example, a blog post about climate change without scientific evidence. When reading opinion pieces, keep in mind who the author is if they have any strong beliefs or affiliations which could lead to bias.\r\n \tOutdated sources: Information from a decade ago might not reflect current knowledge. This is particularly the case in medical and technology fields.\r\n \tAnecdotal pieces: These rely on personal stories rather than data. For example, websites that make claims about conspiracies may not list their sources about where their information has come from and should be treated with caution.\r\n \tUnverified online sources: Websites without credibility checks. For example, a random wiki page edited by anyone.\r\n \tNon-peer-reviewed articles: Articles that haven\u2019t been evaluated by experts, for example, a self-published paper on a complex scientific topic, should also be treated with caution. This is because the way that the study was conducted, the results and the interpretation of the results have not been checked and verified by industry experts.\r\n \tAssumptions: These are ideas presented without evidence. For example, if I assume that all students learn the same way without considering individual differences, this can weaken my argument.\r\n\r\nStrong evidence\r\nStrong information sources provide reliable, relevant, and well-supported data that makes your work more convincing. Below are some key types of strong information sources to guide you in selecting the most effective materials for your research.\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tPeer-reviewed journal articles: These articles undergo evaluation by experts in the field, ensuring accuracy and validity. For example, a research article published in well-respected journals like\u202fNature\u202for\u202fThe Lancet.\r\n \tGovernment data and official reports: These sources offer authoritative and reliable information. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics provides comprehensive data on demographics and economic indicators, which can be crucial for evidence-based research.\r\n \tBooks by experts: Authored by recognised authorities, these books provide in-depth analysis and insights. An example is a comprehensive text on economics by a renowned economist.\r\n \tAcademic conference papers: These are often peer-reviewed and they usually present current research and developments. For example, recordings from the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence could be a strong source of information for students of information technology subjects.\r\n \tReputable news outlets: Articles from news sources that are known for fact-checking and reliability, such as articles from the ABC, the BBC or The Guardian, often offer well-researched information.\r\n\r\nResponding to authors' claims\r\nWhile you read books and articles or watch videos to find information for your assignments, remember to think about how the authors support their claims. Are they using evidence from reputable sources or are they relying on unchecked sources and assumptions?\r\n\r\nOnce you have found information that you would like to cite in your work, here are some techniques that can be used. In these examples, the writer will use weak points on which to base their counter arguments and strong points to support their argument.\r\nConcession + counter claim\r\nExample: Admittedly, there are benefits Bako\u2019s (2022) plan for overhauling the education system. However, they do not justify the costs that will be worn by taxpayers.\r\n\r\nRefute with evidence\r\nExample: Cienfuegos (2024) claims that intermittent fasting can reduce inflammation. This is despite a lack of support from recent empirical studies.\r\n\r\nAcknowledge opposing views\r\nExample: A number of academics (Daalman, 2021; Aronov &amp; Weller, 2021; Stojanovski 2019) are of the view that an excess of sugar can cause hyperactivity in children, a new study by Zapatero (2024) shows that this may not be the case.\r\n\r\nIdentify a lack of evidence\r\nExample: Whittaker (2023) does not provide support their claim with evidence from a reliable source.\r\n\r\nComparative analysis\r\nExample: Smith (2020) uses anecdotal evidence from a personal experience to conclude that positive education is completely ineffective. On the other hand, Christopoulos (2023) conducted a systematic review that shows that positive education can be an effective classroom tool.","excerpt":"Selecting credible sources for your assignments enhances the quality and reliability of your work, making your arguments more persuasive and impactful.

Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrackets are commonly used to express mathematical formulae. In order to manipulate expressions containing brackets it is necessary to remove them first. This module discusses how to remove brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on removing brackets in algebra.\r\n\r\nThe law that allows us to expand expressions with brackets in maths is called the distributive law. For instance, A brackets B plus C, is the same as A times B plus A times C, you're multiplying the term outside the brackets by the term inside the brackets, an alternate way of writing A times brackets B plus C, same thing, A times B plus A times C.\r\n\r\nBefore we get into some of the examples just recall some of our work we've done in the past, multiplying positive and negative numbers. Remember if the signs are the same, plus plus or minus minus the answer is positive, if the signs are different, plus and minus, then the answer is negative.\r\n\r\nSo let's use this law and multiply out this particular expression just with numbers; two times brackets three plus five, so we're going two times three plus two times five, two times three is six, two times five is ten, answer is 16. Let's look at another example but here we're using algebra; three brackets X plus two, we use the same law again, three times X plus three times two, which is three X plus six, notice we can't add three X to six because the terms are different. Similarly with negative signs, minus five brackets M plus four gives us minus five times M plus minus five times four, which is minus five M minus 20, the terms are different so they must be left alone. And finally, with two negative signs, so be careful here, minus two brackets P minus seven is minus two times P plus minus two times minus seven, which is minus two P plus 14.\r\n\r\nLet's now move on with two sets of brackets, four brackets M minus three plus two brackets M plus one. We use the same ideas as before giving us four M minus 12 plus two M plus two, collect the like terms and we've got six M minus 10. Similarly, two sets of brackets but this time we have to be really careful because there's a negative sign. Minus six X brackets two X plus three minus three X brackets X minus three gives us minus 12 X squared minus 18 X minus 3 X squared and there it is we've got plus 9 X at the end, two negatives give us a positive, collecting up the like terms we've got minus 15 X squared minus 9 X.\r\n\r\nNow let's looked at two sets of brackets that are placed side by side, in other words we're multiplying the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets. And if you look at the example in blue the idea is to multiply the first term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets and the second term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets, in other words X multiplied by X plus three plus two multiplied by X plus three. If we expand these brackets further we have X squared plus three X plus two X plus six and collecting the like terms gives us an answer of A squared plus five X plus six.\r\n\r\nHere are two more examples that have been written out for you. The one in blue at the top, notice there's a negative sign so be careful here with the negative signs, giving us an answer of M squared minus M minus 20 and the example in red there are two negative signs here, so be doubly careful when multiplying out these sets of brackets, giving us an answer of Q squared minus nine Q plus 18.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distributive law\r\nIn what follow we will write \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)\\) which means \\(a\\times\\left(b+c\\right)\\). That is the \\(a\\) multiplies the bracket. We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In words, the \\(a\\) outside the bracket multiplies everything inside the bracket.\r\n\r\nFor example, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\left(3+5\\right) &amp; =2\\times3+2\\times5. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nRemoving the brackets is called expansion.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tExpand \\(3\\left(x+2\\right)\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =3\\times x+3\\times2\\\\ &amp; =3x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-5\\left(m+4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -5\\left(m+4\\right) &amp; =\\left(-5\\right)\\times m+\\left(-5\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-5m-20. \\end{align*}\\] Usually we omit the first step shown above and expand directly as shown in the following examples.\r\n \tExpand \\(-2\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =-2p+14. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(e\\left(e+2\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} e\\left(e+2\\right) &amp; =e^{2}+2e. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-\\left(4p-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -\\left(4p-3\\right) &amp; =-4p+3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right) &amp; =4x-12+2x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x-10. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right) &amp; =12k^{2}+18k-3k^{2}+9k\\\\ &amp; =9k^{2}+27k. \\end{align*}\\] Now do some practice. See Exercise \\(1\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBinomial products\r\nA binomial product is something like \\(\\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right).\\) It is the product of two binomial terms.1 A binomial term is an expression involving two terms. Examples are: \\(a+3\\), \\(1+c,\\) \\(a+b,\\) and \\(\\left(3x+2y\\right)\\). \r\n\r\nTo expand the two brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. Then simplify if possible. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right) &amp; =m\\left(m+3\\right)+2\\left(m+3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+3m+2m+6\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+5m+6. \\end{align*}\\] Symbolically we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)\\left(c+d\\right) &amp; =ac+ad+bc+bd. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTwo important cases\r\nSpecial cases arise when the binomial terms are the same. That is \\(\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)=\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)=\\left(a-b\\right)^{2}\\).\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+ab+ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-ab-ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These occur often in mathematics and you should commit them to memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right) &amp; =2fg+\\left(2f\\right)\\left(5h\\right)+3g+15h\\\\ &amp; =2fg+10fh+3g+15h. \\end{align*}\\] In this case not further simplification is possible.\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =p^{2}-7p-2p+14\\\\ &amp; =p^{2}-9p+14 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right) &amp; =2w^{2}-8w+3w-12\\\\ &amp; =2w^{2}-5w-12 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-12rs-12sr+9s^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] This can be done faster if you remember eqn (2) above: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r\\right)^{2}-2\\left(4r\\right)\\left(3s\\right)+\\left(-3s\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] For some practice, please try out Exercise 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\n\r\n \tRemove the brackets:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;2\\left(x-5\\right) &amp;

Like terms contain exactly the same pro-numerals, in other words letters or variables, so look at the like terms down the left hand column and compare them with the unlike terms in the right hand column, in particular look at the last term, seven E F and eight F E, they are in fact like terms. Only like terms can be added or subtracted. For instance, in this example, seven E plus 10 E, the terms are alike, therefore they can be added to give you 17 E. But look at this one, be careful because here we have two terms, the X squared term and the X term so we have to add them separately, so three X squared minus X squared minus four X squared gives us minus two X squared, and two X, which is different to the X squared term must be left alone so the answer is minus two X squared plus two X.Similarly if you look at this example in red, there's a U V term which is the same as V U and that is different to the U term therefore that gives us minus two U V plus three U, we keep them separate, we can't add minus two U V to three U. And finally six R squared S minus two R S squared, they look similar but they are not the same, these are two unlike terms so we can't simplify this expression.Now before we move on to multiplying and dividing algebraic terms make sure you are familiar with the multiplication and dividing of positive and negative numbers on this slide. So study this carefully before moving onto the next slide.\r\n\r\nBut let's multiply some pro-numerals. Here's the first example, minus four times three B, multiply the numbers together, minus four and minus three gives you plus 12 and then just tag on the B afterwards so the answer is 12 B. Here's another one, multiply out the numbers first, three times minus 15 gives you minus 15, now multiply the pro-numeral, E and E squared is E cubed, so the answer is minus 15 E cubed.\r\n\r\nThe next example in red multiply out, as before, the numbers, minus two times minus four is plus eight, then the pro-numerals, there's a U squared term and there are Vs there, V times V is a V squared, so the answer is eight U squared V squared. Notice in these examples that because we're multiplying the actual terms can be different, so make sure you know the difference between adding and subtracting where the pro\u2011numerals must be exactly the same, multiplying and dividing the pro-numerals can be different.\r\n\r\nFinally minus three P Q times minus two Q times P, multiply out the numbers, that gives you plus six, P times P is P squared, Q times Q is Q squared, so the answer is six P squared Q squared. Now in this slide we're dividing pro-numerals, so the first term minus 12 W Y Z divided by the second term three Y Z, express that as a fraction first and look for terms that will cancel top and bottom, in this case the Ys cancel top and bottom and the Zs cancel top and bottom, notice three will divide into 12 four times, so the answer is minus four W.\r\n\r\nHere's another one slightly more complicated. Now in this slide we're dividing pro\u2011numerals, so the first term minus 12 W Y Z divided by the second term three Y Z, express that as a fraction first and look for terms that will cancel top and bottom, in this case the Ys cancel top and bottom and the Zs cancel top and bottom, notice three will divide into 12 four times so the answer is minus four W.\r\n\r\nHere's another one slightly more complicated. Writing it as a fraction, minus two M squared N over six M N squared, and then in the third term I've expanded the M squared so it's M times N and then I've tacked the N on the end of that and I've done the same thing with the denominator with N squared N times N, so you can clearly see where the Ms and the Ns cancel, giving you an answer of minus M over three N. Notice minus on the top divided by plus on the bottom gives you an answer of minus.\r\n\r\nAnd finally in blue there's a multiplication and a division so you again express that as a fraction, expand the A squared and then cancel top and bottom terms giving you an answer of two A. Now we'll move on to some slightly harder problems with algebra, but notice the rule that we use first of all, in other words if an expression has brackets in it that must be done first, secondly if there are indices you do that next, thirdly you do multiplying and dividing and lastly you do adding and subtraction.\r\n\r\nSo let's do some examples. Three S T minus three S times four T, notice we have a negative sign and a multiplication sign, so the times is worked out first, so three S times four T is 12 S T, notice now we have subtraction, three S T minus 12 S T, notice the terms are alike therefore we can subtract them, three minus 12 is minus nine S T.\r\n\r\nLet's look at this one. We've got two terms in brackets and a division, so the brackets are worked out first, even though there's a plus inside the brackets must be worked out first, which gives us six X Y, then we divide that by two X, express that as a fraction, cancel any terms, Xs cancel here, twos go into six three times so the answer is three Y.\r\n\r\nAnd finally look at this one. We have brackets, multiplication, addition and division. So the brackets is worked out first, that gives as minus 10 A squared B squared in the second line, then I write out the rest, plus two A cubed B cubed divided by A B, what do we do next, well we have division which becomes ... comes before addition, therefore we divide the two A cubed B cubed by A B, writing that as a fraction, simplifying by cancelling like terms and then in the final line we've just got two terms which we can add together. Notice again that the terms are exactly the same, A squared B squared, therefore we can add them, minus 10 plus two gives us minus eight A squared B squared.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short video.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/images\/maths-a11-01.jpg\" float=\"true\" caption=\"A page from Al-Khwarizmis al-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-gabr wa-l-muqabala, an early book on algebra.\" alt=\"A page in Arabic of one of the earliest books on Algebra\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\nLike and unlike terms\r\nLike terms contain exactly the same pro-numerals. 1 A pro-numeral is a combination of letters, symbols and numbers. For example, \\(3x\\) is a pro-numeral. In algebra, when we write \\(3x\\) we really mean \\(3\\times x\\). Another example of a pro-numeral is \\(5ab\\). This means \\(5\\times a\\times b\\). Note that \\(5ab=5ba\\). The order of the letters and numbers is not important but usually we write numbers first and use alphabetical order for the letters. While \\(5ba\\) is correct, it is more common to write \\(5ab\\). The following table gives some examples of like and unlike terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike terms\r\nUnlike terms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(3x,5x\\)\r\n\\(3x,5y\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(2a,-3a\\)\r\n\\(3a,3\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(m^{2},7m^{2}\\)\r\n\\(m^{2},7m\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(2ab,3ab\\)\r\n\\(2a^{2}b,3ab^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(3xyz,5xyz\\)\r\n\\(3xyz,3xy\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(3ef,3fe\\)\r\n\\(3ef,\\,3eg\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(6\\alpha\\beta\\), \\(\\beta\\alpha\\)\r\n\\(6\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\), \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some practice, please go to Exercise 1 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddition and subtraction\r\nThe essential rule is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly like terms may be added or subtracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1. \\[\\begin{align*} 7e+10e &amp; =7\\times e+10\\times e\\\\ &amp; =\\left(7+10\\right)e\\\\ &amp; =17e. \\end{align*}\\] In practice we would not put in the first line. It is included to reinforce what \\(7e\\) and \\(10e\\) mean. In practice we would probably go straight to the answer. That is \\(7e+10e=17e\\).\r\n\r\nExample 2. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x^{2}-x^{2}-4x^{2} &amp; =\\left(3-1-4\\right)x^{2}\\\\ &amp; =-2x^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 3. 2 This example shows how we can gather different like terms. In this case \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 3m-4n+6m+n &amp; =\\left(3+6\\right)m+\\left(-4+1\\right)n\\\\ &amp; =9m-3n. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 4. \\[\\begin{align*} 3a-b-5a+4ab-3b+ab &amp; =\\left(3-5\\right)a+\\left(-1-3\\right)b+\\left(4+1\\right)ab\\\\ &amp; =-2a-4b+5ab. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 5. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-x^{2} &amp; \\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 6. \\[\\begin{align*} p+2p-3 &amp; =3p-3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 7. \\[ 8uv+3u-10vu=-2uv+3u. \\]\r\n\r\nExample 8. \\[ 6r^{2}s-2rs^{2}\\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\]\r\n\r\nFor some practice, please go to Exercise 2 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplication\r\nBoth like and unlike terms may be multiplied. When multiplying two or more terms consider: 1. The sign of the answer.3 In doing the multiplication, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the product. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n \tThe product of the terms.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{l} 1.\\quad\\left(-4\\right)\\times\\left(-3b\\right)=12b\\\\ 2.\\quad-2\\times6y=-12y\\\\ 3.\\quad2e\\times\\left(-5e^{2}\\right)=-10e^{3}\\\\ 4.\\quad\\left(-2u^{2}v\\right)\\times\\left(-4v\\right)=8u^{2}v^{2}\\\\ 5.\\quad-3pq\\times\\left(-2q\\right)\\times p=6p^{2}q^{2} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision\r\nIn algebra, we often use fractions. For example: 4 In this case the top term, 2 is called the numerator, the bottom term 5, is called the denominator and the horizontal line between them is called the fraction bar, division bar or vinculum. \\[ \\frac{2}{5}=2\\div5. \\] Similarly for algebraic terms: \\[ \\frac{2x^{2}yz}{3xy^{2}}=2x^{2}yz\\div3xy^{2}. \\] When dividing algebraic terms:\r\n\r\n \tRewrite as a fraction if necessary\r\n \tExpand any powers\r\n \tEstablish the sign of the answer5 In doing the division, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the quotient. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tCancel any common factors\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tDivide \\(-12wyz\\) by \\(3yz\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} -12wyz\\div3yz &amp; =\\frac{-12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{determine sign}\\\\ &amp; =-4w\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tDivide \\(2m^{2}n\\) by \\(-6mn^{2}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2m^{2}n\\div6mn^{2} &amp; =\\frac{2m^{2}n}{-6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2m^{2}n}{6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{m}{3n}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab.\\)\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab &amp; =\\frac{6a^{2}\\times4ab}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{24a^{3}b}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{establish sign and expand powers}\\\\ &amp; =2a^{2}\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tDivide \\(m+2\\) by \\(4m\\) \\[ \\left(m+2\\right)\\div4m=\\frac{m+2}{4m}. \\] There are no common factors and so it is not possible to simplify further.\r\n\r\nFor practice examples see Exercise 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder of operations\r\nThe basic operations of arithmetic are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. Usually the order in which we perform the operations is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, what is the answer to the following arithmetic problem \\[ 4+3\\times2+5\\;? \\] At first sight there are several possible answers.\r\n\r\nWorking from left to right we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times2+5\\\\ &amp; =14+5\\\\ &amp; =19. \\end{align*}\\] Working from right to left we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+3\\times7\\\\ &amp; =4+21\\\\ &amp; =25. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIf we do the multiplication first we get another answer: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\\\ &amp; =15. \\end{align*}\\] Yet another answer is obtained by doing the additions first: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times7\\\\ &amp; =49. \\end{align*}\\] Mathematicians don\u2019t like imprecision. In order to allow only one answer to the problem we perform operations in the following order:\r\n\r\n \tBrackets\r\n \tIndices\r\n \tMultiplication and Division from left to right\r\n \tAddition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nUsing the first letters (bold) we get the abbreviation BIMDAS.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule the answer to our problem is \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\quad\\textrm{multiplication first}\\\\ &amp; =15\\quad\\textrm{then addition}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \t\\(3\\times2+4=6+4=10.\\)\r\n \t\\(3+2\\times4=3+8=11\\).\r\n \t\\(\\left(3+2\\right)\\times4=5\\times4=20.\\)\r\n \t\\(3-2^{2}=3-2\\times2=3-4=-1\\).\r\n \t\\(\\left(3-2\\right)^{2}=\\left(3-2\\right)\\times\\left(3-2\\right)=1\\times1=1\\).\r\n \t\\(3^{2}-2^{2}=3\\times3-2\\times2=9-4=5\\).\r\n \t\\(3st-3s\\times4t=3st-12st=-9st\\).\r\n\r\nFor some practice, see Exercise 4.\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nWhich of the five terms on the right is a like term with the term on the left?\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llllllll} 1) &amp;

Adding and subtracting fractions always requires a common denominator (which is the lower half of the fraction). These need to be the same before you can add or subtract. This means converting some of the fractions to forms that are consistent in the denominators. It is possible to do this even when the fractions include pronumerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on adding and subtracting algebraic fractions. Let's start by looking at a simple fraction, 18 over 24. Notice that 18 and 24 are divisible by six, six into 18 goes three, six into 24 goes four; we say that 18 and 24 have a common factor of six, so the answer is three quarters. Similarly 120 over 70 is divisible by 10, in other words 120 and 70 have a common factor of 10, that gives us an answer of 12 over seven.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that only fractions that have a common denominator can be added or subtracted. For instance, in this case, seven tenths minus three sevenths, the common denominator here is 70, in other words 10 will divide into 70 and so will seven, so we have to carry out that process shown on the screen. At the bottom of the slide we are now subtracting these two fractions to give us an answer of 19 over 70.\r\n\r\nNow let's move on to algebraic fractions. Again we're using the same idea as with normal fractions. Here we have H over six plus two H over nine, notice that the six and nine are different so we need a common denominator which, in this case, is 18 and thus we go through the process of adding two algebraic fractions with a common denominator of 18. Once we get to the bottom of our problem we then add the two terms up, three H plus four H which gives us seven H, notice the terms here are alike.\r\n\r\nHere's another example, E plus one over two plus E over five, two and five must divide into a number, the common denominator here would have to be 10 so that equals E plus one over two times five over five plus E over five times two over two. Notice the next line down we have brackets, E plus one, be careful here we're multiplying five by E plus one, so it's five brackets E plus one plus two E over 10. Once we expand the brackets we get five E plus five plus two E, that gives us seven E plus five. Notice I'm adding the like terms together and there are two different terms here, an E term and a number, which is five.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at subtracting algebraic fractions, five over two A minus three over four, so we need a common denominator, a number, that both two A and four will divide into. So four A will be that common denominator so we'd need to multiply two A by two and four by A to get our common denominator of four A. Then we have in the bottom line of our slide 10 minus three A, notice here that the terms are different so we can't do anything about them, we leave them alone, so the answer is 10 minus three A over four A.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourselves. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview of ordinary fractions\r\nThe basic concept is that only fractions with a common denominator may be added or subtracted.1 The denominator is the number or pro-numeral on the bottom of the fraction. The number on top is called the numerator. For the fraction \\(2\/5\\), the numerator is \\(2\\) and the denominator is \\(5.\\) \r\n\r\nFor example:2 In this example the common denominator is \\(10\\times7=70.\\) So we want the denominator to be \\(70\\) for both fractions. This is done by multiplying by \\(7\/7\\) and \\(10\/10\\) respectively. Note that these are both equal to one and so you change nothing when you multiply a fraction by them. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{7}{10}-\\frac{3}{7} &amp; =\\frac{7}{10}\\times\\frac{7}{7}-\\frac{3}{7}\\times\\frac{10}{10},\\;\\textrm{common denominator is $70,$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{49}{70}-\\frac{30}{70}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{49-30}{70}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{19}{70}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebraic fractions\r\nAlgebraic fractions are fractions that involve pro-numerals.

The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions. Let\u2019s start by looking at a normal fraction, 18 over 24. Notice that 18 and 24 are divisible by six, six into 18 goes three, sixes into 24 goes four, in other words the answer is three over four. See that six is a common factor of 18 and 24. Similarly 120 over 70 has a common factor of 10 because 10 will divide into both 120 and 70 leaving us with an answer of 12 over seven.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an algebraic fraction. Notice how I\u2019ve ... N minus N squared becomes N minus N minus N and in doing so the factor N minus N will cancel both top and bottom. Four eight squared Y over six Y squared, notice here how I\u2019ve expanded the X squared and the Y squared to look for factors, here there\u2019s a factor of Y top and bottom and there\u2019s a factor of two that divides both into four and six. And finally six X plus nine Y in the denominator will actually factorise into three brackets two X plus Y three Y and in doing so the threes now become factors top and bottom.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s multiply algebraic fractions. Here\u2019s a simple fraction where I\u2019ve looked for factors both top and bottom, once that\u2019s done you can cancel the factors in the numerator with factors in the denominator, as done with the previous slide. Similarly with an algebraic fraction the As will cancel because they are common factors, there\u2019s also a factor of seven.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a more complicated algebraic fraction, but notice the method is still the same, X minus two is a factor, X is a factor and likewise with the second example, I\u2019ve taken a factor of three out of three M plus 12 giving me three brackets M plus four, the M squared plus four M will factorise into M brackets M plus four, again notice in doing this I can now factorise the top and the bottom factors M plus four.\r\n\r\nDividing algebraic fractions is very much the same but remember the rule, when you divide by a fraction you change the division sign to a multiplication sign and then you invert the fraction that comes afterwards. Here I\u2019ve done this and I\u2019ve factored the eight and 12. Always cancel where possible.\r\n\r\nThe second example I\u2019ve done exactly the same, the factor of four is on the top and 24 on the bottom, fours into four, fours into 24 and finally here\u2019s another example where I\u2019ve taken a factor of two outside of two A plus four allowing me to factorise the top and bottom of the fraction, the factor here being the A plus two.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying fractions\r\nYou have probably seen numerical fractions like \\(\\frac{18}{24}\\) before. Generally we like to reduce fractions to their simplest form. This is done by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.1 The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number at the bottom of the fraction.\r\n\r\nSo \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{18}{24} &amp; =\\frac{9}{12}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ three} \\end{alignat*}\\] this is the simplest form as there is no number that divides into \\(3\\) and \\(4\\). Note that this can be done in one step if you realise that \\(6\\) divides into \\(18\\) and \\(24\\). Then you have \\[ \\frac{18}{24}=\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ six.} \\] Simplifying fractions by dividing the same number into both the numerator and denominator is called cancelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying algebraic fractions\r\nWe can use the same technique to simplify algebraic fractions as we did in simplifying numerical fractions. For example:\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}}\\).\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}y}{3y^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}}{3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:y. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab}.\\)\r\nThis example shows it is important to divide all terms on the top by the same number.2 Note that you cannot divide the \\(2c\\) on top and the \\(2b\\) on the bottom by \\(2\\). This is because all the terms on the top and bottom have to be divided by \\(2\\). So it would be wrong to write \\[ \\frac{b+2c}{2b}=\\frac{b+c}{b} \\] because the \\(b\\) on the top line was not divided by \\(2\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab} &amp; =\\frac{(b+2c)}{2b}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:a\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{b+2c}{2b}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}}\\). 3 This example uses the fact that \\(\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}=\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)\\). Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are just numbers, \\(m-n\\) is also a number and so we can divide by \\(m-n\\) provided that \\(m\\neq n\\). If \\(m=n\\), \\(m-n=0\\) and we mustn\u2019t divide anything by zero. \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)}\\quad\\left(m\\neq n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{m-n}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:m-n. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y}.\\) 4 This example factorizes the denominator first. We then divide the top and bottom of the fraction by the common factor \\(3\\).  \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y} &amp; =\\frac{3x^{2}y}{3\\left(2x+3y\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{2}y}{2x+3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:3. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)}.\\) 5 This example uses the fact that \\(p-2=-\\left(2-p\\right).\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)} &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3\\left(2p-p^{2}\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(2-p\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:\\mathit{p}\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(p-2\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{using\\;\\mathit{p-\\mathrm{2}=-\\left(\\mathrm{2}-p\\right)}}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3p}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:p-2. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you can only divide the denominator and numerator if ALL the terms have a common factor. For example, it would be WRONG to write \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x+2}{2y} &amp; =\\frac{x+1}{y} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nbecause the \\(x\\) in the top line has not been divided by 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo practice these techniques, please look at Exercise 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying fractions\r\nWhen we multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators of each fraction. For example, \\[ \\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{7}{5}=\\frac{21}{20}. \\]\r\n\r\nIt is best to simplify each fraction, if possible, before you do the multiplication. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{15}{8}\\times\\frac{24}{35} &amp; =\\frac{15}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{35}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;24\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:8\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:8}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{7}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;15\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:35\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{7}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying algebraic fractions\r\nYou can also use these ideas with algebraic fractions. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5a}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{a} &amp; =\\frac{5}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{1}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;5\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{a}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\quad\\:\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;14\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{7}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{7}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{1}\\\\ &amp; =10. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nHere are some more examples:6 Note that we are showing every step in the examples below and so the solutions may appear long and complicated. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can take as many steps as you like. As you get more familiar with algebra you will naturally use fewer steps to get a result.\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}}\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{x}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x-2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2x}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}.\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m} &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m\\left(m+4\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:by\\:\\mathit{m+4}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{5}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2m}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing fractions\r\nThe reciprocal of a fraction is just the fraction turned upside down. So the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) and the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.7 When dividing fractions we change the divide sign to times and turn the last fraction upside down.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5}{4}\\div\\frac{19}{8} &amp; =\\frac{5}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{19}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing algebraic fractions\r\nWe use the same technique for dividing algebraic fractions as we use for dividing numerical fractions.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8} &amp; =\\frac{7p}{12}\\times\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7p}{3}\\times\\frac{2}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{14p}{9}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m\\). 8 Don\u2019t forget that \\(6m=\\frac{6m}{1}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div\\frac{6m}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6m}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{6n}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x} &amp; =\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{24}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5x\\left(x+3\\right)}{54}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6} &amp; =\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(a+2\\right)}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercise 1\r\nSimplify the following fractions:\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\frac{12ab^{2}}{8bc}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{5x-20}{5}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9u-18}{2u-4}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{6t-9}{12-8t}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{b}{b^{2}+7b}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{\\left(j+4\\right)\\left(j-4\\right)}{3j+12}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{2\\left(5-v\\right)}{3v-15}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9r^{2}-3r}{16r-48r^{2}}\\)\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answers: Exercise 1\"]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllllllllllll} &amp; 1. &amp; \\frac{3ab}{2c} &amp; &amp; &amp; 2. &amp; x-4 &amp; &amp; &amp; 3. &amp; \\frac{9}{2} &amp; &amp; &amp; 4. &amp; -\\frac{3}{4}\\\\ &amp; 5. &amp; \\frac{1}{b+7} &amp; &amp; &amp; 6. &amp; \\frac{j-4}{3} &amp; &amp; &amp; 7. &amp; -\\frac{2}{3} &amp; &amp; &amp; 8. &amp; -\\frac{3}{16}\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nA.

To get rid of the \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\) we divide both sides of the formula by \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\).2 When rearranging formulas, the main rule is: whatever you do to one side you must do to the other.\r\n\r\nWhat we get is:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=\\frac{P(1+nr)}{(1+nr)} \\] Now the \\((1+nr)\\) terms can be canceled to get: \\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=P \\] or \\[ P=\\frac{A}{(1+nr)} \\]\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging formulas, the starting point depends on the formula itself. We illustrate this in the examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSuppose you have $1000 to invest and you want to know how long it will take to get $2000 with an interest rate of 5% per year with simple interest.\r\nThe formula for simple interest is \\[ A=P(1+rn) \\] and we know A=$2000, \\(P=\\$1000\\) and \\(r=5%=5\/100=0.05\\). We want to find \\(n\\).\r\nSolution:\r\nOur first step is to get rid of the \\(P\\) that is multiplying the bracket \\((1+rn)\\). We do this by dividing both sides by \\(P\\) to get \\[ \\frac{A}{P}=\\frac{P(1+rn)}{P}. \\] Now we cancel the \\(P\\) to get 3 There is actually a 1 multiplying the bracket we never show it. Because multiplying by 1 does not change anything, we can remove the brackets as shown below. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P} &amp; =\\left(1+rn\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1+rn. \\end{align*}\\] Next we want to get the \\(rn\\) on its own. We do this by subtracting 1 from both sides to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P}-1 &amp; =1+rn-1\\\\ &amp; =rn. \\end{align*}\\] The last step is to get \\(n\\) on its own. We do this by dividing both sides by \\(r\\)4 Remember dividing by \\(r\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1\/r\\).\r\n\\[ \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)=\\frac{nr}{r}. \\] Canceling the \\(r\\) on the right hand side gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right) &amp; =n\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] We can now calculate \\(n\\) by substituting the values for \\(A\\), \\(P\\) and \\(r\\): \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{0.05}\\left(\\frac{2000}{1000}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =20. \\end{align*}\\] So it will take 20 years to double the initial $1000 investment!\r\n \tTransform the formula \\(P=2(L-W)\\) to make \u2018\\(L\\)\u2019 the subject.\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =2\\left(L-W\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(L-W\\right)}{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{divide both sides by 2}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =L-W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{cancel the 2 and remove the brackets}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2}+W &amp; =L-W+W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{add $W$ to both sides}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =L\\\\ L &amp; =\\frac{P}{2}+W\\quad\\textrm{rearrange to put $L$ on the left}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that you don\u2019t have to put explanations on each line in your solution.

We also use a square root function (the opposite to squaring) to get \\(v\\) from \\(v^{2}\\) in the last line. Note that taking the square root of a positive number gives two possibilities - one positive, the other negative. Usually a formula will relate to a physical situation and the negative solution may not make sense. In this case, you take the positive solution as the answer. We do this in the last step of the solution. \\[\\begin{align*} E &amp; =mgh+\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\\\ E-mgh &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtracting $mgh$ from both sides}\\right)\\\\ 2\\left(E-mgh\\right) &amp; =mv^{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $2$ }\\right)\\\\ \\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m} &amp; =v^{2}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{dividing both sides by $m$ }\\right)$ }\\\\ v^{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}\\\\ v &amp; =\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{taking the square root of both sides}\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{taking the positive root as the answer.}\\right)$ } \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIf \\(2\/k=(j+1)\/3,\\) find \\(k\\).\r\nSolution: Note that the fraction bar acts like a bracket.

Here we demonstrate manipulating or rearranging complex formulas, with overviews and practice questions.\r\nLet's look at some more complicated formulas where the new subject variable:\r\n\r\n \tappears more than once in the formula, like \\(m\\) in \\(E=mgh+\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\).\r\n \tis on the bottom (the denominator) of a fraction, like \\(v\\) in \\(1\/f=1\/v-1\/u\\).\r\n \tis an exponent, like \\(t\\) in \\(Q=Ae^{kt}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject variable appears more than once in the formula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strategy is to move all terms containing the desired subject variable to the same side of the equal sign and factorize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tMake \\(m\\) the subject in the formula:1 In the formula, \\(E\\) is the subject because we have \\(E=\\cdots\\). We want to rearrange to get \\(m=\\cdots\\). \\[ E=mgh+\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}. \\] In this case the \\(m\\) \u2019s are already on the same side of the equation so we can take out \\(m\\) as a factor: \\[ E=m\\left(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\right). \\] To get \\(m\\) on its own we divide both sides by \\(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{m\\left(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\right)}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =m\\quad\\left(\\textrm{after cancelling}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\[ m=\\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}. \\] It is possible to improve the look of the answer by getting rid of the \\(1\/2\\) in the denominator. We do this by multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by \\(2\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}\\times\\frac{2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2E}{2gh+v^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(I\\) the subject of the formula \\(Ir=E-IR\\).\r\nFirst get all terms involving \\(I\\) to one side by adding \\(IR\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} Ir+IR &amp; =E-IR+IR\\\\ &amp; =E. \\end{align*}\\] Take \\(I\\) out as common factor: \\[\\begin{align*} I\\left(r+R\\right) &amp; =E.\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Now divide both sides by \\(r+R\\): \\[ I=\\frac{E}{r+R}. \\]\r\n\r\nThe examples above showed all steps in detail. You don\u2019t have to do that when answering questions.

You then proceed as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tFor example, make \\(u\\) the subject of the formula \\(1\/f=1\/v-1\/u\\). A suitable common divisor of the denominators is \\(fvu\\).3 A common divisor is the product of the denominators. For example to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}\\) you can use a lowest common denominator of \\(8\\) or a common denominator of \\(8\\times4=32\\). Either will give the same result, though the lowest common denominator involves smaller numbers. To simplify algebraic fractions like \\(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}\\) we must use a common denominator \\(v\\times u=vu\\) as we don\u2019t know the values of \\(v\\) and \\(u\\).  Multiplying both sides of the formula by \\(fvu\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{f}fvu &amp; =\\frac{1}{v}fvu-\\frac{1}{u}fvu\\\\ vu &amp; =fu-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{after canceling the terms}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Next step is to get all terms involving \\(u\\) on the same side: \\[\\begin{align*} vu-fu &amp; =-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtracting $fu$ from both sides}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now we factorize the left hand side: \\[\\begin{align*} u\\left(v-f\\right) &amp; =-fv. \\end{align*}\\] The final step is to divide both sides by \\(v-f\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv}{v-f}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{fv}{v-f}. \\end{align*}\\] This is a correct answer but having a \\(-\\) sign in front is ugly. We get rid of it by multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by \\(-1\\): \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv\\left(-1\\right)}{\\left(v-f\\right)\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{fv}{\\left(f-v\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The example above showed all steps. You don\u2019t have to provide such detail. An acceptable solution would be: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{f} &amp; =\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}\\\\ vu &amp; =fu-fv\\\\ u\\left(v-f\\right) &amp; =-fv\\\\ u &amp; =\\frac{-fv}{v-f}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{fv}{f-v}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tTranspose \\(m=\\sqrt{\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}}\\) to make \\(s\\) the subject.\r\nThe square root sign acts as a bracket and we want to remove it so we can get at the subject term \\(s\\).4 The term \\(\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}\\) is considered as a single term. We remove it by squaring both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} m^{2} &amp; =\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] Now multiply both sides by \\(s\\left(e-f\\right)\\) to get:5 Note that \\(m^{2}=m^{2}\/1\\) and so the common denominator of both sides is \\(1\\times s\\left(e-f\\right)=s\\left(e-f\\right)\\). By multiplying by \\(s\\left(e-f\\right)\\)we remove fractions. \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}= &amp; d-s. \\end{align*}\\] Now we gather all the \\(s\\) terms to one side. We add \\(s\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+s= &amp; d. \\end{align*}\\] Take a common factor of \\(s\\) out of the right hand side: \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right) &amp; =d. \\end{align*}\\] Now we divide by \\(\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right)\\) to get the result \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =\\frac{d}{\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The example above showed all steps.

The \u201crules\u201d shown below have been established from first principles and can be used to find derivative functions directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHere's a short video on differentiation. The general form is y equals x to the n. And if y equals x to the n, then the derivative, dydx, is nx to the n minus one. So if we have a function y equals x to the seven, then here n equals seven, hence dydx equals 7x to the 6th, because n minus one is seven minus one.\r\n\r\nLet's look at another example. Here we have two functions, y equals x\u00b3, plus x to the 6th. When we differentiate them we still differentiate them as though they were separate functions, in other words, x\u00b3 becomes three 8ths squared, and x to the 6th becomes 6x to the five, using the rule in the top right hand corner.\r\n\r\nLet's look at a trickier one. Here we have the function y equals one over x\u00b2. Notice the x\u00b2 is on the bottom of the fraction and this is quite difficult to do at this stage, so we now put x\u00b2 up on the top. In other words, we remove the denominator and express it as x to the minus two. Now we have a negative index. And when we differentiate that n is now negative two. So the derivative dydx is negative two x to the negative three, because n minus one is minus two minus one. Notice we finally revert back to the fraction because x to the minus three is minus two over x\u00b3.\r\n\r\nLet's look at this function, y equals the square root of x. We express y equals the square root of x as an index so we write it as x to the half, and we always do this before we differentiate. Now proceeding with the differentiation, dydx will be a half x to the minus half, because here n is a half, so n minus one is a half minus one, which is minus a half. So our final answer is one over two to the square root of x.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at a more complicated fraction. The function here is now x to the four minus one, all over the square root of x. Here I'm breaking it up into two separate fractions, in other words, it's x to the four over x to the half minus one over x to the half. Notice I've replaced the square root sign by an index. And now I write h to the four over h to the half as one term, which is x to the seven over two. One over x to the half is the same as x to the minus a half. In other words, I'm dividing through by x to the half.\r\n\r\nThe derivative is now calculated separably because we have two functions here to differentiate. So x to the seven over two becomes seven over 2x to the five over two, and x to the minus a half becomes a half x to the minus three over two. Notice we have two negative signs, one before the negative x and the index is negative a half, so the two negatives gives us a positive as our answer. So that we have the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat about a derivative of a function which has a constant in front of it? K is the constant. If we have a constant in front of the function then the derivative is the constant multiplied by the rule that we've used before, nx to the n minus one. As a good example, the function here is y equals 7h to the six, so the derivative, dydx is seven, we leave the constant alone, and now we just differentiate h to the six, which becomes 6x to the five. The final answer is given by seven times 6x to the five. Seven sixes are 42, so the answer is now 42x to the five.\r\n\r\nFinally, the derivative of a function which is simply a constant. So here if y equals a constant, then the derivative is always zero. Probably the easiest one of the lot to remember. In other words, if you have any number which is a constant, such as 99, y equals 99, then the derivative is equal to zero.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. Here are 10 questions that I want you to differentiate. The answers are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this video.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative notations\r\nWe will also introduce alternative notations for derivatives. When \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\), i.e.\u00a0\\(y=f(x)\\), the derivative function may be written as \\(y'\\) or \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) or \\(f'(x)\\).\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that \\(d\/dx\\) is a symbol that means \u201ctake the derivative of something with respect to \\(x\\)\u201d. For example \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] means take the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperational rules\r\nHere are some rules for these are essential and underlie much of what you will use in your course.

This is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between two points (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) and (\\(x_{2},y_{2}\\)) on the line.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{rise}{run}=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tFind the gradient of the line \\(y=3x+6\\) (see previous example).\r\nSolution:\r\nThe points (\\(0,6\\)) and (\\(-2,0\\)) are on the line \\(y=3x+6\\).1 Note that it doesn\u2019t matter which points you choose for \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right)\\). The only requirement is that both points must be on the line. For example we could let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6-0}{0-\\left(-2\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =3 \\end{align*}\\] the same answer as at left. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{0-6}{-2-0}=\\frac{-6}{-2}=3. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is 3.\r\n \tFind the gradient of the line joining the two points \\(\\left(1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4,5\\right).\\)\r\nSolution:\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(4,5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{5-3}{4-1}=\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is \\(2\/3.\\)\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquation of a straight line\r\nThe general equation of a straight line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient, and \\(c\\) is the value of the intercept on the \\(y\\)-axis. The figure below illustrates this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equation of a straight line can also be written as2 To see this, assume you know a point \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) on the line and the gradient \\(m\\) of the line. Since \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) is on the line, it must satisfy the equation \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} y_{1} &amp; =mx_{1}+c. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now subtract \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =mx+c-\\left(mx_{1}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =mx-mx_{1}+c-c\\\\ &amp; =m\\left(x-x_{1}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =m(x-x_{1}) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient and (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) is a point on the line. This is called point-slope form because it assumes you know\r\n\r\n \tA point on the line \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and\r\n \tThe gradient \\(m\\) of the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome properties of linear graphs\r\n\r\n \tA line that slopes up and to the right has a positive gradient.\r\n \tA line that slopes up and to the left has a negative gradient.\r\n \tParallel lines have the same gradient.\r\n \tThe gradients of two mutually perpendicular lines multiply to \\(-1.\\)\r\n \tA line parallel to the x \u2013 axis has a gradient of \\(0\\).\r\n \tA line parallel to the y \u2013 axis; the gradient is undefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nFirst note that the graph has a positive gradient.3 Because it slopes up (increases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a negative gradient, you know something has gone wrong. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(3,7\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7-3}{3-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] So the gradient \\(m=2.\\) From the graph we see the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(1.\\) That is, \\(c=1.\\) Now we can substitute in the equation for a line4 The equation for a line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. \\end{align*}\\] to get \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x+1. \\end{align*}\\] The equation for the line is \\(y=2x+1.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nFirst note that the graph has a negative gradient.5 Because it slopes down (decreases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a positive gradient, you know something has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-4}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,4\\right)\\) and so \\(c=4.\\) Hence the equation of the line is \\(y=-\\frac{2}{3}x+4.\\) This is a correct answer but the fraction makes it look a bit ugly. We can multiply both sides by \\(3\\) to get rid of the fraction. The equation then becomes: \\(3y=-2x+12\\) or \\(3y+2x=12.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3: Sketch the function \\(2y=x-6\\) and state the gradient of the straight line\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept, set \\(y=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =x-6\\\\ \\text{and }x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(6,0\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFor the \\(y\\)-intercept, set \\(x=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =-6\\\\ \\text{and }y &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,-3\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nNow draw a line between these two points as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the gradient, let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-\\left(-3\\right)}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, to find the gradient divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =x-6\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x-3. \\end{align*}\\] This is in the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) and we see that the gradient \\(m=1\/2\\) as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4: Sketch the graph of \\(3y+2x=0\\) and state the gradient of the straight line\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept \\(y=0\\). Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) For the \\(y\\)-intercept, \\(x=0.\\) Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) But this means the \\(x\\)-intercept is equal to the \\(y\\)-intercept. This is because the line passes through the origin \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\).6 We could have seen this by considering the equation of the line: \\(3y+2x=0.\\) Rearranging the equation and dividing by \\(3\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-2x\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x. \\end{align*}\\] Comparing this to the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) we see that \\(m=-2\/3\\) and \\(c=0.\\) That is the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nSo far we know the graph goes through \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) To sketch its graph we need another point. To find another point on the line, pick any value of \\(x\\) (other than \\(0\\)). Let\u2019s take \\(x=3\\) then substituting into the equation we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2\\left(3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-6\\\\ y &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] so the point \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) is on the graph.\r\n\r\nTo sketch the graph, we plot the points \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) and draw a line through them as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the gradient, rearrange the equation to the form of \\(y=mx+c\\):\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe gradient of the line is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5: Find the equation of the line that passes through the points \\(\\left(-1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2,0\\right)\\)\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the gradient \\(m.\\) Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(2,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-3}{2-\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{3}\\\\ &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe equation to our line is \\(y=-x+c\\). We need to find \\(c.\\) To find \\(c\\) substitute either of the points on the line into the equation for the line.

Let's work on some essential skills in manipulating formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nA formula is a general rule giving the relationship between variables. The variables are represented by letters which provide us with a short hand way of writing the rule. Sometimes a formula is given in an inconvenient form and it's necessary to change the subject of the formula. When we do this we need to use certain operations, so remember the following rules; minus undoes plus, plus undoes minus, division undoes multiplication, multiplication undoes division, square root undoes square and square undoes square root.\r\n\r\nLet's look at some examples to explain this. Let's look at the formula A plus B equals C. Now let's make A the subject, because we want to obtain A on its own we start by subtracting B so let's use the rule minus undoes plus, so we have A plus B minus B equals C minus B, so from this we obtained A equals C minus B. Note we have to use minus B on both sides of the equation, remember the saying what we do to one side of the equation we must do to the other side of the equation so we have transposed the formula to find an expression for A.\r\n\r\nLet's look at another example. We have X minus Y equals Z and we want to make Y the subject. Notice we have a minus Y so let's use the rule plus undoes minus, we write X minus Y plus Y equals Z plus Y. Note we have used plus Y on both sides of the equation so this leaves us with X equals Z plus Y, but we want Y on its own so we use the rule minus undoes plus again to get rid of Z so we have X minus Z equals Z minus Z plus Y which leaves us with X minus Z equals Y or rewriting that with Y on the left hand side we have Y equals X minus Z.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is A equals L times W where A is the area, L is the length and W is the width of the rectangle. We say that A is the subject of the formula, let's say we want to find the width, W, so we use the rule division undoes multiplication by dividing both sides by L. So let's do that. We divide the left hand side by L, which is A over L and we divide the right hand side by L, so it's L times W over L. So A over L is equal to W, notice that the Ls have cancelled out on the right hand side. If we swap the left hand side and the right hand side we have W equals A divided by L.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the formula M equals Q over P. M is the magnification of an object, Q is the size of the image and P is the size of the object. We want to find Q, the image size, so let's use the rule multiplication undoes division, so if we multiply both sides by P we get M times P equals Q over P multiplied by P and this leaves us with M times P equals Q and so if we swap both left hand side and right hand side we get Q equals M times P.\r\n\r\nThat completes the film clip of transposition of formulas. Now go to the worksheet and try some exercises for yourself. Thank you.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSome of the most important equations that we might be required to transpose occur frequently in science, engineering and economics. They are called formulae and give a general rule describing the relationship between variable quantities\r\n\r\nHere are some examples: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} A= &amp; \\pi r^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} s &amp; =ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} S= &amp; P(1+i)^{n} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn these examples \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are, respectively, the subjects of the formulae.1 \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are called subjects because they are on the left hand side of the formula and followed by an equal sign. Sometimes a formula is given in a particular form and it is necessary to rearrange the formula to make a different variable the subject:\r\n\r\nWe know the area of a circle \\(A=\\pi r^{2}\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius and so we can calculate \\(A\\) for any value of \\(r\\). What if we know the area \\(A\\) and have to calculate the radius \\(r\\)?2 We need \\(r\\) to be the subject rather than \\(A\\).\r\n\r\nWe know \\(s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\\) but what if we know \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) and want to calculate \\(a\\)?3 We need \\(a\\) to be the subject rather than \\(s\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging equations and formulas, whatever you do on one side of the equal sign, you must do on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A+B=C\\).\r\nSolution:4 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being added to \\(A\\) on the left side so we subtract \\(B\\) from the left side to get rid of the \\(B\\) terms on the left. Our rule says we must subtract the \\(B\\) from the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =C\\\\ A+B-B &amp; =C-B\\quad\\textrm{subtracting $B$ from both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C-B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A-B=C\\).\r\nSolution:5 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being subtracted from \\(A\\) on the left side so we add \\(B\\) to the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must add B to the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A-B &amp; =C\\\\ A-B+B &amp; =C+B\\quad\\textrm{adding $B$ to both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C+B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(AB=C\\).\r\nSolution:6 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is multiplying \\(A\\) on the left side so we divide by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must divide by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{dividing both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(\\frac{A}{B}=C\\).\r\nSolution:7 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is dividing \\(A\\) on the left side so we multiply by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must multiply by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{B} &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject of the formula \\(A^{2}=B\\).\r\nSolution:8 This case involves \\(A^{2}\\). The inverse (opposite) operation to squaring is the square root. So to get A on its own we need to take the square root of both sides.  \\[\\begin{align*} A^{2} &amp; =B\\\\ \\sqrt{A^{2}} &amp; =\\sqrt{B}\\quad\\textrm{taking the square root of both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =\\sqrt{B}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake A the subject of the formula \\(\\sqrt{A}=B\\).\r\nSolution:9 This case involves \\(\\sqrt{A}\\). The inverse (opposite) operation to the square root is squaring. So to get A on its own we need to square both sides. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{A} &amp; =B\\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{A}\\right)^{2} &amp; =B^{2}\\\\ A &amp; =B^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse operations\r\nIn the above examples we used operations to \"undo\" operations.

This helps you think critically, which is one of the key skills required in university study.\r\nIn this section, we will start by learning about the key steps and elements of argument analysis before providing you with an example to test your new knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe steps of argument analysis\r\nHere are the key steps to help you break down and assess an argument effectively.\r\nStep one: What is the argument?\r\nAn argument is the position or claim that the writer is putting forward. \u00a0An argument can be recognised via:\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\nevidence \r\ntext comparisons.\r\nAn argument will assume an audience's awareness of the topic and also consider their assumptions, prior knowledge and interest.\r\n\r\nSee also Reading skills.\r\nStep two: Identifying bias\r\nBias can be recognised via language, sentence structure, evidence used for supporting claims (including quality of evidence), lack of evidence for refuting claims, repetition of themes and language.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to examine your own biases. When all you can think about is your own perspective on an argument, you blind yourself to the actual argument before you. Therefore, it can be useful to identify your own feelings on the topics and be aware of them. Also, remember to keep an open mind while you read.\r\nStep three: Who is the audience? Who is the writer?\r\nThe audience is the assumed readership that the author wants to persuade or influence. Think about who the writer is writing for, and why they are writing to that audience. Is their intention to persuade, inform or entertain them? \r\n\r\nSome texts provide useful information about the author, such as their level of expertise, profession, or affiliations. If this information is not provided then a search for their name can often turn up the results you need. Knowing the writer's profession or affiliations can help us understand their motives, and knowing their level of expertise can inform us about whether or not we should take their view seriously.\r\nStep four: How does the author influence the audience?\r\nSelected vocabulary (which could include colloquial or slang words), language techniques and sentence construction are used to appeal to a particular audience. Arguments are carefully considered to ensure they are convincing to the target audience.\r\nStep five: Critically analyse by identifying claims, evidence and assumptions\r\nCritical analysis starts with these questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is the overall claim of the author?\r\n \tIs the claim backed up by credible evidence?\r\n \tIs the claim based on assumptions?\r\n\r\nStep six: What is the evidence?\r\nEvidence includes information or data from elsewhere to support the claims the writer makes, or refute the claims made by others. Evidence can be judged for quality by the credibility of its origin. Evidence needs to come from a source that has authority and is up-to-date and objective.\r\nIs the evidence credible?\r\nCredible evidence comes from a source that the reader can believe is factual and valid. The key things to look for are:\r\n\r\n \tAuthor: Who does the author work for or write for? What other publications have they been involved in? What is their area and level of expertise in the topic\r\n \tDate: Is the information current given the topic?\r\n \tSource: Is the publication source well known or respected in the industry? Peer reviewed? Relevant to the topic?\r\n","excerpt":"Argument analysis is the process of breaking down an argument to determine if it is logical and well-supported. This helps you think critically, which is one of the key skills required in university study. In this section, we will start by learning about the key steps and elements of argument analysis before providing you with an example to test your new knowledge.

The web can be a good starting place.\r\n\r\nWhen you search for information on a topic, the list of results may include Wikipedia or social media sites such as YouTube, blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. Can you use information from Wikipedia or social media websites for academic study?\r\n\r\nTake the quiz to find out.\r\nActivity: The web and academic study\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle and other search engines\r\nThe web is a rich source of information. Students usually use search engines like Google to find information about an assignment topic, but finding useful resources among many pages of search results can be challenging.\r\n\r\nGoogle and other search engines are easy to search, but they produce a large number of results and many that are not relevant to the topic.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can conduct a much more efficient search and save yourself lots of time and effort by using a few simple search commands. Try  Lifehack's 20 Tips to use Google Search efficiently.\r\n\r\nGoogle is a good place to find background or general information, but you need to be aware of its limitations for academic research.\r\nWhy can't I just Google it?\r\nThis question is covered in more detail in the next tutorial.\r\nUsing Wikipedia for academic research\r\nWhen you do a Google search about a topic you will most likely find Wikipedia listings at the top of your search results. However, Wikipedia is not considered a reliable source of information. This is because we do not know who has added information, what their expertise on the subject is or if the information they have added is accurate.\r\n\r\nWikipedia can be a great place to start your search as it can give you a general understanding of a topic and you can use the sources listed at the bottom of the page as part of your search. However, it is not recommended that you cite Wikipedia articles in your assignments.\r\nGoogle Scholar\r\nAnother way to search the web more effectively is to use Google Scholar as your search engine. Google Scholar is a simple way to search for scholarly literature in articles, theses, books, abstracts and other formats.\r\n\r\nIf you access Google Scholar from the RMIT Library website using your RMIT login, your search results will link you back to the full text resources held by the Library. Go to the Library Google Scholar page for more information.\r\nFor more help on using Google Scholar for research go to Google Scholar search tips or find a video on YouTube.","excerpt":"This section will cover the 'where' and the 'how' of finding information for your research.

These databases can include journal articles, news articles, ebooks, streaming videos, and specialised information such as standards, theses, case studies and images.\r\n\r\nSo what is a library database?\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aiw7E2At5LY\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nI got my first uni assignment and my lecturer told me to look in the library databases for journal articles.\r\n\r\nI was like, THE WHAT?\r\n\r\nBut when I got to the University Library, a librarian explained it to me.\r\n\r\nShe said: first you have to get your head around what the academic journals.\r\n\r\nThese are not your 'dear diary' journals, right?\r\n\r\nAcademic journals are collections of articles written by experts in an academic discipline.\r\n\r\nThey've usually been reviewed by other academics in this field, who have said that this research is original, and important, and at a high standard.\r\n\r\nThis means that, if you use them, you'll get better marks than if you use Wikipedia, or a random website you've found on Google.\r\n\r\nIn the past, journals were always printed; articles were written and collected in journals which were published at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nLibraries collected these and filled lots of shelves with them.\r\n\r\nThen the internet came along and changed the way journals were produced.\r\n\r\nNow they are more often found online as e-journals.\r\n\r\nOnline e-journals are organised in library databases.\r\n\r\nA library database is like a bucket: each holds a collection of e-journals. Some databases hold heaps of journals in them while others don't have that many.\r\n\r\nThe University Library subscribes to databases that focus on relevant subjects for RMIT students and researches.\r\n\r\nNo single database will have all the information you need, so you need to find out which ones are best for what you're researching.\r\n\r\nThe Library has subject guides that show you which databases are best for your area.\r\n\r\nIt's so much easier to find information when you know where to look and why!\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\nChoosing a database\r\nDatabases are a rich source of information in the subject areas taught at RMIT University, but there are many different databases. How do you know which one to choose?\r\n\r\nThe Subject Guides have been written by librarians to help you select the most relevant databases for your topic.\r\n\r\nIf you know the name of the database you want, you can find it using the Database A-Z list from LibrarySearch.\r\nSearching databases\r\nMost databases offer both a basic and an advanced search option. If you need help searching a particular database, look for the Help menu in the database to find tips and 'How to' videos. You may also find database tutorials on YouTube, and from some Library Subject Guides.\r\n\r\nFor an advanced database search, you may need to use Boolean operators. Boolean operators connect your search terms together in specific ways (AND, OR, NOT), and also help you to narrow or broaden your search.\r\n\r\nBoolean operators\r\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to combine keywords using Boolean operators (advanced operators).\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[ll-grid columns=\"3\"]\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/getting-started\/getting-started-databases-and@2x.png\" alt=\"A venn diagram, with two overlapping circles labelled 'Tourism' and 'Travel'.

In this example, we use an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\r\nWildcards\r\norgani?ational behavio?r = organisational, organizational, behaviour, behavior.\r\nYou can use wildcards to broaden your search by substituting letters in words. In this example, we have used a question mark (?) as the wildcard symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you will need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\r\nSearching for a phrase\r\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to search for phrases. Quotation marks placed at the beginning and end of a phrase narrows a search. Only results that include the exact phrase will appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\"organisational behaviour\" = results with the exact words, \"organisational behaviour\"\r\n\r\n[attribution id=\"my-attribution\"][\/attribution]","excerpt":"The Library has an extensive collection of electronic resources which includes e-books, e-journals, streaming videos, and images.

Katrina is a health science student at RMIT University. Recently, Katrina received her marks back for an assignment and she was shocked to find she hadn\u2019t done as well as she\u2019d hoped. Katrina had done what most students do: She had just Googled her topic.\r\n\r\nFeeling down, Katrina asks for feedback from her lecturer, Professor Felinopolous. He explains that while Google is a good starting point to get an overview of a topic, you can\u2019t just use Google and expect to get good marks for your assignment.\r\n\r\nSo, why is that?\r\n\r\nFirstly, the internet is not organised. When you search a term in Google, you\u2019ve probably noticed that you get huge amounts of information returned to you.\r\n\r\nThese results are based on popularity. In other words, Google is a popularity contest and search results are based on Google\u2019s own ranking, rather than credibility or reliability. Google also knows a bit about you. Its \u201cpersonalisation\u201d feature means that your search results will be affected by your internet history, location, and IP address, too.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is little quality control on Google. Anyone can write anything on the internet. The information may be biased, inaccurate, or have a hidden agenda. Information could also be sponsored by sources with vested interests. And lots of information is not authoritative or credible. It\u2019s not written by experts or peer-reviewed.\r\n\r\nOn Google, it can be hard to identify sources. Who wrote it? How do you verify the sources? Trying to find this information can waste valuable research time.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nTo see a list of the best databases your topic area, choose your Subject Guide.\r\n\r\nUse the RMIT Google Scholar link, that way your search results will include resources from some of the RMIT Library online collections.\r\n\r\nYou might like to bookmark these!\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"In this tutorial you will learn why it is important to use high quality information.

The question is usually very specific and will refer to only part of the course content. There are three common types of words to look out for.\r\nContent words\r\nContent words identify concepts or ideas from your course that apply to the topic. To properly understand content words it is often necessary to do some research on the topic first. Think about the following:\r\n\r\n \tWhich part of the course content does the question refer to?\r\n \tWhich aspects of the topic are required?\r\n \tWhat broader context is this question part of?\r\n\r\nInstructional words\r\nA clear understanding of instructional words is vital for answering the question the way the lecturer expects. In an assignment, the lecturer is not only assessing what you know, but also your ability to respond to the content in a particular way. Assignments may require you to:\r\n\r\n \tDescribe or give information about a topic or idea\r\n \tShow or explain the relationship between topics or ideas\r\n \tDescribe or explain a process\r\n \tArgue a point of view\r\n \tCompare different ideas\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nView the meanings of instructional words list\r\nLimiting words\r\nLimiting words narrow down the topic.

This page takes you through the different sections of the DIEP framework.\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Describe\"]\r\n1. Describe the insight\r\nAn insight is something new that you learned or realised. The insight must be relevant to the course and ideally could change your thinking or behaviour in the future. Your insight may apply to your studies, your professional practice, or your future goals.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nThe most important thing I realised this week is the role of questioning in project management...\r\nA reading technique that I have learned recently that I find most valuable for my study is pre-reading, especially skimming and scanning\r\n\r\n2. Describe the circumstances\r\nProvide brief and relevant details of the situation from which you gained the insight. Say what was happening when this learning occurred.\r\n\r\n \tWhat was the context? (e.g. on placement, during reading)\r\n \tWhat was the particular trigger? (e.g. a comment from a patient, a concept in the readings, a particular question or activity in class)\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nI learned this from the lecture in Project Management Techniques by a guest lecturer, Dr Strangelove. She started her presentation by asking us to build a tower from straws... I...\r\nI learned about these techniques for efficient reading from an exercise using a chapter from Anstey (2002) about the four resources model. We used the skimming technique which involves noting full details about the text and what it contains before reading it. We had to look at the whole chapter to identify the main ideas through the headings. I realised I can get a lot of information about the main ideas in a text without actually reading it.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Interpret\"]\r\nAfter describing your insight and the circumstances, you need to discuss its meaning. Interpret what the insight means. You can:\r\n\r\n \texplain why the insight is significant (in general but particularly to you)\r\n \tdiscuss the questions it raises (in general or for you)\r\n \tmake connections between the insight and the course, theory or literature\r\n\r\nNow go deeper to analyse your insight by exploring such aspects as:\r\n\r\n \tWhat the insight might mean (in general and for you).\r\n \tWhat factors influenced, formed or informed your insight e.g.\r\n\r\n \tprevious events or learning\r\n \tyour personality type\r\n \tthe setting or environment\r\n \tyour relationships with people involved\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe consequences of the insight, e.g.\r\n\r\n \tHow does it change things?\r\n \tWhat else do you realise?\r\n \tDoes it cause confusion, doubt or deeper understanding about previous knowledge?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhether the insight is:\r\n\r\n \tvalid and logical\r\n \ttransferable or relevant to other situations\r\n \ta new idea or an evolved understanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nUnderstanding the importance of questions for clarification is central to my understanding of project management. This new emphasis underpins my use\u2026\r\nSkimming and scanning a text is a very new approach to reading for me. It is not something that I had previously practised when reading in my native language. I now understand that reading quickly is not negative, but rather it is more efficient, as Anstey (2002) explains...\r\n[\/ll-accordion] \r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Evaluate\"]\r\n\r\nOnce you have considered the meaning of the insight, you can discuss its value. What relevance does it have? How does it benefit your:\r\n\r\n \tlearning?\r\n \tcoursework?\r\n \tfuture professional development?\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nOne benefit of understanding the critical role of questioning in project management is that it might give me more confidence. This experience has changed my perception of my role as an active participant in project management and not just as a passive receiver of a brief. This changes my view of questioning government authorities. In my job as a \u2026\r\nA significant benefit of understanding the technique of efficient reading is that I have much more confidence in locating important information in a text. Skimming and scanning a text allows me to... more effectively... I used to read every line very carefully. This made academic reading slow and burdensome and I did not always understand the main idea. Now...\r\n[\/ll-accordion] \r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Plan and transfer new learning\"]\r\n\r\nFinally, say how you might apply this new insight in the future.\r\n\r\nYou may use the new insight in:\r\n\r\n \tyour current course, placement or project\r\n \tother courses in your degree\r\n \tyour future work or practice\r\n \tyour private or professional life in general\r\n\r\nYou may find you need to:\r\n\r\n \tset behavioural or learning goals for yourself\r\n \tdevelop strategies to learn \u00a0concepts or skills that you are unfamiliar with or find challenging\r\n\r\nExample\r\nClarifying the requirements of a brief is important and I will need to schedule time to identify and prepare the relevant questions early in the project timeline.\r\nMy new understanding of a technique for efficient reading will be important for me in many areas - in this course, in the Bachelor of Education degree, for my future primary teaching career, and in my life generally. Pre-reading, especially skimming and scanning, is an efficient way to approach a new text in this Teaching Reading course and for all the other subjects in my degree. In my professional development as a primary school teacher I will need to keep up with theory and developments throughout my career so I need to be observant when I approach new texts to identify the useful studies... Finally, applying efficient pre-reading skills will enable me to make better judgements about what to read and how to locate the main ideas and specific information in any material I need for effective participation in society.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n","excerpt":"DIEP is a framework that can be used to guide your academic reflections.

[\/hl][hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the describe section.\"]The guest lecturer in Project Management Techniques, Dr Strangelove, started her presentation by asking us to assemble as a group of five and then build a tower from straws. She said it would be judged in terms of strength, height, and how aesthetically pleasing it was. My group and I did the task cooperatively and we finished it in the prescribed time. We thought we had done very well. Then Dr Strangelove made her point: all groups built the tower without much attention to project management techniques in terms of asking clients for clarification for planning, resources allocation, etc. None of us had asked a single question about the purpose, constraints, resources or stakeholder needs. The group displayed what she describes as 'groupthink'. I was amused and embarrassed but I learned a lesson about project management. [\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"3:Interpret\"]\r\n[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the interpret section.\"]Understanding the importance of clarification is central to my understanding of project management. It underpins my use of PM tools and techniques. Asking clarifying questions about types of work resources (people and equipment) and material resources (supplies, stock, and other consumable resources) allows me to identify what resources are needed for project effectiveness. When we want to designate who or what is accountable for accomplishing tasks in our project schedule I can use PM tools to assign tasks and responsibilities ... All this is possible only if requirements are clarified through questions.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"4:Evaluate\"]\r\n[hl id=\"4\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the evaluate section.\"]A major benefit of understanding the critical role of questioning in project management is that it might give me more confidence about asking questions. It changes my view of questioning government authorities. In my job as a project manager in the reserve bank in Phnom Penh I traditionally would not feel able to question my superiors in these projects. I would try to establish the requirements and resources in some other way. I thought I could avoid asking questions by transferring lessons learned from one situation to another. I could do this by using a framework as a predictive aid to resourcing (Crawford and Pollack, 2004)... But now I feel I am required by my position to determine the dimensions and resources of a project. Knowing the role of questioning to achieve objective clarity for a specific purpose is very valuable for me to give me confidence in my position as a project manager in government projects.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"5:Plan\"]\r\n[hl id=\"5\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the plan section.\"]I believe this new realisation will be useful throughout my degree and in my future professional and private life. In my degree studies, I will endeavour to clarify the critical aspects of project planning by using a questioning technique that allows for understanding objective dimensions, and also any subjective aspects. In my practice as a project manager in Cambodia I will use questioning to clarify the project goals and objectives with all stakeholders. In my life I will question my own assumptions about what is expected of me before I jump in (and build any more towers).[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\nLinking experiences to evidence\r\nLinking the experiences you have had to ideas from the literature produces higher quality reflective writing.

However, being caught plagiarising can lead to possible penalties beginning with a warning, through to expulsion from RMIT. It's not worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2\r\nI'm really worried about my grades and I'm buying a good online essay. Could I get caught?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\r\nFeedback: Online essays are not written in your writing style so it's easy to detect. If you need help with your assessments, visit the Study and Learning Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3\r\nIf I use parts of an essay that I wrote last year, it's not plagiarism - it's good time management.\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: Sure, you're being resourceful, however, this is called self-plagiarism. You must reference all sources, including yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4\r\nParaphrasing is easy, you just need to change the words, don't you?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: This is still plagiarism! It's known as inadequate paraphrasing. Even if you cite your source, you need to change the words and the structure of the original text. In other words, write it in your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 5\r\nAnother student in my class is struggling with an essay task. He asked me to send him my essay to help him with ideas. Is this OK?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: This is known as collusion, which is a form of plagiarism. Allowing others to copy your work makes you as guilty of plagiarism as the person doing the copying. You may even face the same penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 6\r\nIs it plagiarism to copy out big chunks of text, as long as I put them in quotation marks and say where it's from?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: It's not plagiarism, however, it's not good practice. Use direct quotes sparingly. Paraphrasing is a better technique to integrate evidence into your writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 7\r\nEven if my essay passes the plagiarism detector (Turnitin), can my lecturer still claim I plagiarised?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\r\nFeedback: Plagiarism software such as Turnitin only checks duplication.

The purpose is to understand the larger concepts, overall structure and scan for keywords, names and dates. When you have finished, ask yourself the following questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is the case about?\r\n \tWhat issues can I see now?\r\n \tDoes anything immediately connect to my course notes?\r\n\r\nStep 2: Detailed reading\r\nRe-read the case again, more slowly and carefully, for a deeper understanding. Some questions you could ask are:\r\n\r\n \tWhat critical events are important? When and why did they happen?\r\n \tWho are the people involved and who is responsible?\r\n \tWhat are the key problems? What evidence from the case shows this?\r\n \tWhat are the constraints or obstacles to potential solutions?\r\n \tWhat do I need to research?\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Reading skills resources.\r\nStep 3: Annotation\/note-taking\r\nNow, begin to annotate the case and continue to ask yourself questions as you read.\r\n\r\nHighlight, underline and circle text, and add names, labels and comments to:\r\n\r\n \tidentify important points and supporting points (examples, reasons, statistics)\r\n \tdraw connections between ideas\r\n \tmark important definitions and terminology\r\n \tidentify any points that need clarification\r\n\r\nSee the example below.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/case-studies\/case-study-read-the-case@2x.png\" alt=\"A document with highlighted, underlined and circled text with annotations in the margins.\" caption=\"Highlight, underline and circle text|attrib\" caption-gap=\"lg\" size=\"wide\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Note-taking skills tutorials.","excerpt":"The next step is to read the case to identify what the issues are and try to understand how, or why, they might have occurred.

However, other corticosteroids such as Prednisone have proven to benefit patients by reducing inflammation and maintaining periods of remissions (Lichtenstein, 2014). This therapy could be used alongside other antibiotics or immunosuppressants such as Azathioprine 6-MP or Methotrexate as these can be used at low doses and have few recorded side effects (Lichtenstein, 2014).

Team effectiveness within teams requires evaluation in order to ensure alignment of work with the strategic functioning of an organisation. Team structure tends to reflect its purpose and place within the organisation.[\/hl]  [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the outline.\"] Two models of teams reflect their context, goals and purposes. BJB Minerals uses project teams to achieve its goals while ACME Chemicals tends to employ parallel teams to improve output and employee involvement.[\/hl]  [hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the argument.\"]Each team\u2019s effectiveness can be judged according to its output, social processes and learning. The most critical factors in a strategy for improving effectiveness in each case are a compelling direction, an enabling structure, and access to coaching.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Body\"]\r\nThe body of an essay is made up of connected paragraphs presenting your argument. A well written body section can be one of the keys to assignment success. On this page, you will learn about the TEEL paragraph, an effective structure for body paragraphs.\r\nFollow the TEEL strategy when writing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nMake sure each paragraph contains one main idea, which you express in a topic sentence. This is usually the first sentence of the paragraph. The topic sentences develop the argument (thesis) of the essay.\r\n\r\nExpand on the topic sentence in the rest of the paragraph. Add sentences that:\r\n\r\n \texplain or elaborate on the topic sentence\r\n \tprovide evidence (with references) or examples to support the topic sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the final sentence, link back to the main idea in the topic sentence. You may link to the following paragraph if it is a closely related idea This creates cohesion and logical development.\r\n\r\nThe hamburger metaphor represents how to write a paragraph using TEEL.\r\n\r\n[ll-image url=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/assessments\/essays\/essays-structure-burger@2x.png\" alt=\"Hamburger metaphor: topic sentence, explain\/elaborate, evidence\/examples, linking sentence\" attribution-id=\"my-attribution\"][\/ll-image]\r\n\r\nBy reading the topic sentences only, you should be able to see the development of the argument.\r\n\r\nExplore the TEEL structure within the paragraph. Notice how references have been used throughout the paragraph to support the claims.\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"1:Topic sentence|2:Explanation|3:Evidence|4:Example|5:Link\"]\r\n[hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the topic sentence.\"]One factor that impacts positively on team effectiveness is the notion of team cohesiveness.[\/hl] [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the explanation.\"]Team cohesiveness is the key to enabling a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals.[\/hl] [hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the evidence.\"]Mathieu et al (2014) note that the right mix of people sets the stage for a team to be effective, with performance quality and innovation as a result.[\/hl] [hl id=\"4\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the example.\"]BJB Minerals' project teams were established on an opt-in basis based on the idealistic model, where members were encouraged by the clear goals and knowledge of the skill sets needed (Berlin, Carlstrom &amp; Sandberg 2012). The project assigned to the team was also well resourced, with clear timelines and an end date (BJB Minerals 2014).[\/hl] [hl id=\"5\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the link.\"]This idealistic team model validated the diverse skills that individuals brought to the team, celebrating both personal satisfaction as well as the team's project achievements.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Conclusion\"]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion tells the reader what was covered.\r\n\r\nConclusions are written from narrow topics to broad ones.

On the other hand, BJB Minerals\u2019 opt-in, project team model provided individual incentives as well as the broader, team benefits to achieve project success. Teams were then terminated to allow for re-formations for new and emerging goals.[\/hl] [hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this sentence relates the paragraph to the 'big picture'.\"] Effective teams do achieve significant gains for organisations and as BJB Minerals\u2019 opt-in project model demonstrates, personal validation and achievements alongside realistic goals can be more effective on a personal and company level.

All staff are on the email system. There have been occasions when an email virus has been sent to out employees. Many employees were not sure how to respond to this problem. Some employees forwarded these emails to others and the virus was able to spread. The university now has a policy in place to prevent the spread of such problems in future. All staff should notify a ITS Service and Support Officer immediately if they suspect they have received a virus.\r\nITS Service and Support\r\n\r\nThe main point is:\r\n\r\nAll staff should notify an ITS Service and Support Officer immediately if they suspect they have received a virus.\r\n\r\nRewritten email:\r\n\r\nDear all,\r\nAll staff are advised to contact a ITS Service and Support Officer immediately on suspicion of an email virus.

These examples will help you to identify and use the right tone in your email messages.\r\nTone indicates your attitude towards a topic. You can create a positive tone by using positive words. Look at the examples below. The tone in the second sentences are more positive.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1:\r\nThe report won\u2019t be ready until Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2:\r\nWe will send the report on Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1:\r\nYou have not registered for this course and cannot attend until you do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2:\r\nPlease register for this course so that you can attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words you use can also indicate your attitude towards the reader. In the examples below, the verbs used in the first column suggest a negative or emotive tone from the writer. The verbs in the second column are far more neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegative tone\r\nNeutral tone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou claim that...\r\nYou tell us that...\r\n\r\n\r\nYou fail to understand that...\r\nMay we point out that...\r\n\r\n\r\nYou neglected to send the contract.\r\nThe contract was not enclosed...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alleged incident...\r\nThe incident you refer to...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Making requests\"]\r\nWhen writing professional emails, you may need to make requests or respond to requests. The language you use to do this is very important.\r\n\r\nYou will often need to ask other people to do something in your professional life. How you ask people to do this is very important. The language you use depends on the context and your relationship to the other person.\r\n\r\nLook at the following request that has been written differently to show four different contexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContext\r\nRequest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery polite\r\nWould it be possible to raise this issue with Rochelle next week?\r\n\r\n\r\nPolite\r\nCould you raise this issue with Rochelle next week?\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect\r\nCan you please raise this issue with Rochelle next week?\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect order\r\nPlease raise this issue with Rochelle next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclining requests\r\nSometimes, you may need to decline a request. You also need to do this politely. One way is to offer a reason. It is also helpful to suggest an alternative.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest\r\nResponse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to meet at 4pm today to discuss this further?\r\nI'm afraid I'm not available at 4pm today. Can we catch up at 9:30am tomorrow morning?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you could forward the documents before you go home this evening, that would be great.\r\nUnfortunately, I am out of the office all day. Can I forward the documents first thing tomorrow morning?\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you raise this issue with Rochelle when you meet her next week?\r\nI'm sorry, I can't. I'll be out of the office all of next week. I'm back on the following Monday, so I could arrange to meet her then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow polite are you?\r\nSometimes it is a good idea to ask a colleague to read your email before it is sent to the recipient. You can also find websites that check your writing for levels of politeness.\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Subject lines\"]\r\nSubject lines tell the reader about the content and purpose of the email. They need to be clear, accurate and concise.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor\r\nGood (clear and concise)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDumb workflow process\r\n[Impolite: keep the tone neutral]\r\nClarifying workflow process\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n[Too vague: be specific]\r\nCollaborative media program update\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting on Tuesday at 9:30 to discuss next stage in project\r\n[Too much detail for a subject line.]\r\nProject meeting 30 Sept, 9:30am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Email greetings\"]\r\nEmails are an important form of written communication in the workplace. This resource covers how to write a professional email greeting.\r\nThe way you start your message is extremely important.\r\n\r\nThe words you use will depend on the context of:\r\n\r\n \thow well you know the person\r\n \twhether the person has a higher professional status than you\r\n \twhether you know the person's name and\/or gender.\r\n\r\nIn business communication, it is advisable to use a more formal style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalutation\r\nContext\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir\/Madam\r\nFormal\r\nWhen you don't know the name of the person you are writing to.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Smith\r\nFormal (Male)\r\nWhen you know the family name.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Ms. Mendez\r\nFormal (Female)\r\nWhen you know the family name\r\n\r\n(N.B. 'Ms' now more commonly used than 'Miss' or 'Mrs').\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Shrestha\r\nFormal\r\nWhen you know the family name and professional title.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Yamabishi Jun\r\nFormal\r\nWhen you don't know which name is the family name, use the names as you have them.\r\n\r\n(N.B. many cultures put their family name first. As an 'outsider' you probably won't know which name is which. Do not assume which is the family name and which is the first name).\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Harpreet\r\nSemi-formal\r\nWhen you know the first name and it is culturally appropriate to use the first name.\r\n\r\n\r\nHello Jerry\r\nInformal\r\nWhen you know the person's first name.\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Jerry\r\nVery informal\r\nUse only when you know the person well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Jerry\r\nExtremely informal\r\nOnly use with people you know very, very well.\r\n\r\nNot usually used in professional or workplace emails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Email layout\"]\r\nEmails are very different from other types of professional writing. They need to be read quickly and generally do not contain a lot of detailed information. Here are some tips for creating an effective layout for your emails.\r\n\r\nLayout and bullet points\r\nThe layout of the email can significantly improve its readability.\r\n\r\n \tPresent your points in smaller chunks of text.\r\n \tUse bullet points or numbering to draw attention to key points and\/or lists\r\n\r\nLook at the following examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nPoor readability:\r\n\r\nHello Saul,\r\n\r\nI hope this finds you well.

She was not a member of auto assist and desperate to get home quickly. She called out to the people standing nearby that she would pay 500 dollars to anyone who would pull her car free but no one was willing to help.

Helen noticed Merryn's car stranded and towed it to firm ground.\r\n\r\nAfter Helen towed Merryn's car to safety, a bystander told Helen about the 500 dollar reward promised by Merryn.

The elements of a simple contract include: Intention, Agreement (offer + acceptance), Consideration, Capacity, Genuine Consent, and Legality. The first three elements must be satisfied in all simple contracts and may create an apparent simple contract. Elements 4-6 may affect the validity of a contract.\r\nRules\r\nOn the first element of intention, the agreement could be regarded as one of business involving payment for a service. The law presumes that there is an intention to create legal relations in business agreements (See Edwards v Skyways). If we were to argue it is a social agreement made on a beach, the rebuttal could apply as it appears Merryn is in serious trouble and the money offered for help is quite generous.\r\nApply\r\nMerryn would then appear to make a valid offer, however it is not clear that there has been a valid acceptance. An offer must be communicated to the offeree and acceptance must be made in reliance of the offer. It seems that Helen is unaware of Merryn's offer before she undertakes the task of helping her with the car before she knows there is a reward. Therefore no acceptance has been made at this stage (See R v Clarke).\r\nConclusion\r\nThere would also appear to be a problem with consideration. Consideration must be of a legal value and exchanged by both parties. It can be present, future but not past. It must be more than a person is already required to do by law or by contract. Since Helen tries to claim the $500 after she towed Merryn's car the consideration is past and not valid (See Roscorla v Thomas). When Helen took this action it seems to have been part of her job as a council worker and therefore the consideration is not sufficient (See Stylk v Myrick). There is no valid contract between Merryn and Helen.","excerpt":"This section will take you through the process of constructing a legal argument in contract law.

Below are some hints and tools using a problem from Company Law. When answering a legal problem, it is useful to apply the IRAC structure so that you address all areas required.\r\n\r\nIRAC structure\r\nThe IRAC method has four steps:\r\n\r\n \tIdentify the issue\r\n \tRelevant law - here you need to explain the law not just state it; this could be sections\/s of the Corporations Act or case law\r\n \tApplication to the facts - the law is applied to the facts of the problem\r\n \tConclusion\r\n\r\nUse the following IRAC structure as a guide to answer case study questions.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"IRAC structure transcript\"]\r\n\r\n \tIssue: Define the legal relevant issue.\r\n \tRelevant law: Identify legal principles from cases and statutes. Explain the law, don't just state it.\r\n \tApply to the facts: Develop legal arguments by applying the law to the facts.\r\n \tConclusion: Arrive at a considered conclusion.\r\n\r\nNote: Students gain the most marks by explaining the relevant law and then applying it to the facts.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nExample question and answer\r\nQuestion\r\nBingo Ltd is a manufacturer of electrical goods. It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\r\n(This a five-mark question)\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant law\r\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication to facts\r\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only. Many Company Law problems will involve multiple issues. In these scenarios each issue would need to be addressed. For example: The first issue is... The second issue is whether...\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\n1.

There are twenty members who contribute an amount of 500 dollars per annum for the general upkeep of villas. At a general meeting, the members resolved to acquire a small piece of land adjacent to one of the villas so that a tennis court could be built on it. The meeting also passed a special resolution to change the constitution to increase the annual contribution to 1,500 dollars per annum to enable the land to be purchased and the tennis court to be built on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nText\r\nIRAC structure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue is whether the member is bound by a change to the constitution which requires an increase in the contribution of capital.\r\nIssue\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, this member has no liability to pay the $1,500.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legal principle in the scenario is firstly that members are bound by changes in the statutory contract.

A huge crowd of shoppers entered the store (including Bert). Bert decided to go to the menswear department on the second floor and climbed the stairs with dozens of keen shoppers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the stairs were unable to take the weight of so many shoppers and one of the stairs gave way. Bert fell three metres and suffered extensive injuries. He will be in hospital for the next six months.\r\nThe details\r\nYou will need the details below to complete the following exercises. Use the case information as detailed below to guide you through this tutorial and to fill out the the Negligence Model Plan.\r\n\r\nBert may have a cause for action in the tort of negligence against Groovy Clothing Store (GCS). To prove that Groovy Clothing Store was negligent in this case, Bert must establish that:\r\n\r\n1) GCS owed him a duty of care\r\n\r\n2) GCS breached the applicable standard of that duty; and\r\n\r\n3) GCS's breach of such duty of care resulted in Bert's suffering loss or damage.\r\n\r\nLord Atkin's neighbour test suggested that person A owes a duty of care if B is sufficiently proximate to A. In other words, the test will hold if A's actions or omissions may affect B in a reasonably foreseeable manner and consequently cause damage or suffering to B. In this case, Groovy Clothing Store owes Bert a duty of care because Bert was in their premises and such duty of care is non delegable (and hence could not be discharged) to Groovy Clothing Store's contractor who was hired to renovate the premises. According to the neighbour test, occupiers of land owe a duty of care to their entrants (neighbours) in respect of premises because of their control over the premise Australian Safeway Stores v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7. Since Bert's presence in the store was organised and controlled by the store, and it is reasonably foreseeable that Groovy Clothing Store's actions and omissions could cause damage to Bert and other shoppers, it is hence sufficient for Groovy Clothing Store to owe Bert a duty of care.\r\n\r\nThe standard of care owed by Groovy Clothing Store is that of an ordinary, reasonable and prudent occupier who takes reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of harm to entrants (not just shoppers) of the premises Bolton v Stone [1951] 1 All ER 1078. In this case, no information was given as to the standards usually required of storeowners or whether Groovy Clothing Store had complied with the retail industry's general standards of practice. However it is reasonably foreseeable that harm could occur: allowing too many people to climb the stairs at the same time could very likely cause serious injuries, especially when people started pushing against each other. In addition, Groovy Clothing Store should have foreseen (as it had intended to do) that an opening sale would attract a huge crowd to the store. However we have no information to support whether or not the stairs would collapse when too many people were stepping on it. Clearly such an accident could have been avoided if Groovy Clothing Store had simply made an announcement using the public address system or by putting up signs reminding shoppers not to rush up the stairs. Also, Groovy Clothing Store could have hired extra staff to control the customer flow at the stairs. Given the likelihood of serious harm to the stair users, it would have been reasonable for ordinary and prudent storeowners to perform the above precautions. Groovy Clothing Store omitted these precautions, failed to warn Bert and other shoppers and as a result caused Bert extensive injuries. It appears that Groovy Clothing Store breached its duty of care to Bert.\r\n\r\nAlthough a shopper entering a shop like Groovy Clothing Store would not assume voluntarily (volenti non fit injuria) the risk of falling down a collapsed staircase, in defence of its breaching duty of care, Groovy Clothing Store could probably claim that Bert was partly liable for his injury due to his failure to take reasonable care of himself (contributory negligence) on the grounds that an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person would not force him or herself up the stairs at the same time along with so many other people because of the foreseeability of an accident Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12. If this were the case, then not all the losses and damages Bert suffered would be recoverable.\r\n\r\nIf Groovy Clothing Store failed to prove that it was partly Bert's negligence that caused himself such injuries, it would then be completely liable to Bert for any foreseeable loss or damage (Wagon Mound Cases) which he suffered as a result of the breach. But for the breach, Bert would not have suffered extensive injuries and be hospitalised for six months Cork v Kirby MacLean LTD [1952] 2 AII ER 402; Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55. Hence the medical expenses for Bert's hospitalisation and any foreseeable and reasonable physical or other economic damages (e.g. loss of earning capacity), though not mentioned in the case, would be recoverable. It appears that Bert would be successful if he sued Groovy Clothing Store for negligence. However, if Bert was held partly liable for his injury due to contributory negligence, he might be able to recover only part of these damages.","excerpt":"In this section, we are going to use the Negligence Model Plan to answer a case study.

It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\r\n(This a five-mark question)\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant law\r\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case, is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Guildford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication to facts\r\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only.

If you are writing an assignment, you will need to reference pursuant to the AGLC (4th edition).\r\n \tNote 2: This is a sample 'model' answer which has been prepared as an example of legal analysis. It does not purport to be a comprehensive piece of advice on this topic.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn the tort of negligence the plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care, breached that duty and that harm was caused as a result of a breach of that duty: Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] ACC 562.\r\nDuty of care\r\nFor Brooke to make a successful claim against the Yarra Valley City Council she must establish that a duty of care existed. If Brooke's relationship with the Council does not fall within an established category for duty of care, two tests will be applied. The first test is the neighbour test that asks whether the defendant could foresee that damage might result from their action to someone in the plaintiff's position. It could be argued in Brooke's case that the signs put up by the Council created a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury of some kind to someone in Brooke's position (see Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112). The second test considers salient features such as whether the plaintiff was in a vulnerable position (Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar (2009) 75 NSWLR 649).\r\n\r\nPrecedent tell us that public authorities and local councils have been found to owe a duty of care to members of the public (see Vairy v Wyong Shire Council; Shirt v Wyong Shire Council and Romeo v Conservation Commission of the NT). Members of the public using the water under its control rely on the Council to provide accurate safety signs (see Nagle v Rottnest Island Authority 1993).\r\nBreach of duty\r\nThe second element required to prove negligence is that a duty of care has been breached. To determine whether there has been a breach of duty the question must be asked whether a reasonable person would have foreseen the harm in the circumstances and taken steps to prevent it (see the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s48(1)).\r\n\r\nThe defendant's conduct is measured by the test or standard of what a 'reasonable person of ordinary prudence' would have done in the same circumstances as the defendant. The test is objective (though it has some limited subjective elements). For instance, the standard of care may be alerted if the defendant has special skills or a defendant who is a child. A council, which is responsible for the maintenance of a river such as the YVCC and where there exists a hidden danger, will owe a duty of care to warn people of foreseeable risks.\r\n\r\nThe law must then balance the degree of the risk and the likelihood of injury occurring, against the expense and difficulty of taking precautions (see Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s48(2)). If the possibility of injury is small, then the defendant may be entitled to disregard it (Bolton v Stone 1951). However, if the degree of injury is serious and the cost of taking precautions is low then the defendant will be expected to take appropriate action to minimise the risk (Paris v Stepney Borough Council 1951). The YVCC should have been aware that a water skier could take the sign 'Deep Water' to mean that it was safe to ski and thus suffer a serious injury in proceeding to do so. The cost of changing the signs and warning people of the dangers may have been small in comparison to the risk associated with not doing so. In an analogous case of Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 the local council was held liable for erecting a 'deep water' sign which was ambiguous and encouraged an inexperienced skier to undertaking water-skiing in shallow water. However, with the existence of legislative provisions applying to public authorities, the local council's resources are a factor that now must be taken into account (see Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s83).\r\nCausation\r\nHarm is also an essential part of negligence. The plaintiff must show that the defendant's negligence caused the harm they have suffered. The test of causation is reflected in a two-part statutory test: Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) s51. The first part of the test is factual causation, meaning Brooke must show that her injuries were factually linked to, or caused by, the Council's negligence. The 'but for' test may be applied where the question is asked 'but for the conduct of the defendant, would the damage have been suffered?' In the current case, Brooke would argue that her injuries would not have happened but for the YVCC's failure to erect the proper warning signs.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the test requires the plaintiff to show that the scope of liability would extend to the defendant's negligence, meaning that it would be appropriate to extend liability to the defendant in these particular circumstances. Thus, Brooke must demonstrate that the damage suffered was within the scope of liability. The test is one of reasonable foreseeability. If the damage was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant then liability will flow (See Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd V Miller Steamship Co. Pty 1967). Brooke may be successful in her claim against YVCC if she can prove that a council would be aware that there was a real risk of physical injuries of the kind sustained by her as a result of using the river due to the incorrect signs.\r\nVicarious liability\r\nFinally, the principle of vicarious liability may be considered. This means that the council may be liable for the negligent conduct of a council employee: Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 21.\r\nDefences and remedies\r\nFor completeness, you should consider defences (including whether the risk was obvious) as well as available remedies.\r\n\r\nThe first defence available is voluntary assumption of risk; that is 100% defence, meaning that any liability will be reduced to zero (see Rootes v Shelton [1967] 116 CLR 383 as well as the Wrongs Act (Vic) ss53-54). This rule provides that:\r\n\r\n(1) the Plaintiff had full knowledge and appreciation of the risk, and;\r\n\r\n(2) the plaintiff freely and willingly agreed to the precise risk that eventuated.\r\n\r\nThe second defence is that of contributory negligence meaning that the plaintiff contributed themselves in some way to their own loss or injury, see Ingram v Britten [1994] Australian Torts Reports 81-291. This is a partial defence meaning that liability for any losses will be shared between the plaintiff and the defendant.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This section will take you through the process of constructing a legal argument around the tort of negligence.

Group members need to collaborate at key points throughout the whole process. Play this video to find out how.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YDXLtELfLkU\"][transcript]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour talk may be a group effort and this introduces organizational issues that can make or break the success of your presentation.\r\n\r\nIt's not appropriate to dissect the talk like a cake and distribute the parts to individual members to take care of. The body needs to be worked on by everyone collaboratively.\r\n\r\nSpecific sections of the body may be divided between your team to be deeply researched or delivered. But at some stage you need to regroup to put those pieces back together again. First of all, you need to be able to meet face-to-face preferably, and it would be good to have a regular time when this is convenient for all of you. At least once each week.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget to exchange phone numbers and emails as well. If this is not a familiar topic, everyone should just go there own way at first and read broadly to get a feel for the area. But sharing any articles are particularly good of course.\r\n\r\nYou need to regroup soon, and decide what two to four topics should be covered. That is, if these are not already specified by your lecturer and it would be excellent to agree on a central message before you start writing the body, if possible.\r\n\r\nIf you want a central theme, this should be defined early on if you can to guide people's research from the beginning. &gt;When the topics are decided you can go your own way and research your section deeply.\r\n\r\nKeep in touch regularly with any of the other group members, whose area may overlap yours, because you don\u2019t want to repeat material.\r\n\r\nIt is most satisfying and effective if you get to talk on the topic that you have researched yourself. You want to sound like the expert.\r\n\r\nRemember not to measure your contribution to the group in terms of minutes standing up in speaking. This is never the hardest part. The hardest part lies in the researching, collaboration and preparation of visual resources.\r\n\r\nOnce the body of your talk is defined, the group should get together and outline the introduction and conclusion together.\r\n\r\nOne person might write from the perspective of the part that they researched, and introductions and conclusions need to have a sense of overview.\r\n\r\nWriting the introduction and conclusion will be easy once the body is done.\r\n\r\nBut they are almost impossible to write in isolation from the body.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we will be looking at part two of oral presentations a sample structure.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample structure\r\nJust as writing tasks have a structure, oral presentations have structure too. Without the structure, your key points will lack strength or be lost entirely. Play this video for tips on how to get your message across effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2HnoQmOlfeA\"][transcript]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample structure of an oral presentation that I will outline here is about \u2018autistic spectrum disorders\u2019. This sample is supposed to be the outline of a twenty-minute in-class presentation.\r\n\r\nTo hold the whole talk together, I\u2019ve also thought about the central point or message that I would like to get across. In this talk, I would like to emphasise the idea that autism encompasses a very broad range of severities \u2013 from profoundly affected to mildly affected individuals \u2013 and for this reason, it often goes unrecognised when the autism is at high functioning levels.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, I need to establish my topic and it\u2019s importance. Of course, this is the best place to establish your central theme or message, if you have one. If you have a particular reason for talking about this topic from your own work, life, or experience, that is always very engaging for the audience as well. Briefly outline the points you will cover, This is very important if you do not have a projected slide or handouts, where the audience can keep track of this. But avoid any detail at this stage. In a twenty-minute talk, you should limit the introduction to two minutes if possible.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion will consist of no new information about autism itself. The conclusion is the space to recap and remind the listener what we have touched on. If anything that is mentioned is new, it will be about the future needs and directions. The conclusion would be a great place to make recommendations about what should be done at a society level or what needs to be investigated further in research.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this could be made to tie in with our message, that some people can have some form of autism and yet many of their teachers or colleagues do not fully recognise or understand their condition because they expect it to be more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe number of points that you will cover will vary from topic to topic. The advice is to have fewer points than too many in your body. If you have a lot of points, try to group them under three to four themes Talk about less, and go for depth rather than briefly skimming through a shopping list of ideas. If you decide to do an activity in your presentation, put it in where it\u2019s most relevant. However it is probably better to do it earlier in the body or even in the introduction. because it can pique the listener's curiosity before they receive a lot information.\r\n\r\nIf you do have a central message, become skilled at saying the same thing in many different ways. Just as I\u2019ve been doing. It would be very tedious to repeat exactly the same words of course. But, if you do it in a very subtle way, your audience will appreciate the enforcement of that idea.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nPresentation skills\r\nBeing a good speaker is something that can be learned and practised. This video will give you some tips for delivering an effective and professional talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JvxSZH3ipfg\"][transcript]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany students approach writing their oral presentation the same way they approach writing an essay when, in fact, the two are completely different. An oral presentation is assessed on how well you can communicate your message or If you like, how you perform. You may get some assessment marks for the slides you produce or the handouts you\u2019ve made, but essentially you will be marked by how well you communicate your message on the day.\r\n\r\nSo, do not write pages of sentences as you would in an essay. You cannot read these out. Natural speech does not use the long and grammatically complicated sentences that you would write in a text. Your audience would have to concentrate very hard to listen to that.\r\n\r\nThink of your audience. and how you will keep their attention. You need to make it relevant for them, and not just show how much you\u2019ve read. You cannot deliver all of the information you might fit into an essay. For an oral presentation, you need to reduce the amount of detail and repeat key ideas a lot more. What helps a lot is to have a key idea, or message, that you want your audience to remember. They may forget 80% of your talk, but if you have a key theme or a main point that you emphasise over and over again, they will likely remember that. And later, it is easier to remember details in relation to that key point.\r\n\r\nDo not give the impression that you are relating what you have recently read in textbooks. Aim to give the impression that you know a lot about this, topic and that you\u2019ve been working in the field for years. You need to have that air of confidence that comes from talking about something you know really well and have a lot of experience in. Generally, this will not be the reality of course, but you can get very familiar with your topic by reading lots and lots of literature. Five minutes of effective speaking does not mean you have only gathered five minutes of information.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, you need to talk to your audience in a relaxed and natural, but still professional manner. You still want to keep on track, so dot points on cards \u2013 instead of, or in addition to your PowerPoint \u2013 can be quite useful. You don\u2019t want the presentation to sound scripted, but you still want to keep on track; so speaking from dot points is efficient because you are on limited time. It also jogs your memory just in case you\u2019re a little bit nervous.\r\n\r\nWhether you use cards or the screen, remember to look up and look at your audience. This is very important if you really want to communicate with them. You need to relax because when you are nervous, you tend to rush onwards. Breathe deeply, stop to think for a moment. A moment may seem a long time to you, but to your audience it is not noticeable.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also very helpful to indicate when a new topic is being moved onto. The audience do not have the visual cues of a new paragraph as you do when you\u2019re reading. So these shifts in topic need to be shown or expressed. A fresh PowerPoint slide indicates a new shift in topic. But sometimes, it\u2019s hard to know when a speaker has moved onto a new point within that slide. You can do this with words like: secondly, or on the other hand, or let us consider a further example. You might emphasise a new point by moving to a different spot on the stage, changing the quality of your voice, or just pausing for five to ten seconds.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that these non-native features of your language do not interfere with the meaning of the message you are trying to communicate. Saying that, however, if you do have a strong or unusual accent; it may be wise to practice in front of a native speaker, and make sure that they can understand your terminology and what you are trying to say.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nThinking about the content\r\nDo you have a message for your audience? Do you know what to say at each stage? Play this video to avoid the \u2018blah blah blah' delivery and make this an interesting learning experience for your audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gAAH6h-x1mw\"][transcript]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to establish your presence in the introduction of your oral presentation. This is the time to introduce yourself and your team, but keep it brief. Most importantly, establish what you will be talking about. Remember that your audience may know very little about your topic, if anything.\r\n\r\nSo, you may need to set the scene in a very simple and general way. If you have a key idea you\u2019re building your talk around, it is good to identify that in your introduction. It always helps the audience to relate to the speaker and to the topic, if the speaker has a personal reason or a particular experience related to the topic. At least explain why you chose the topic and why you believe it will be worthwhile to listen to. However you do it, this is your chance to capture their attention.\r\n\r\nIf possible, structure your talk around a simple, one-line message. Think of one general concept that you want your audience to remember. If you build your talk around a simple message, it has much more coherence. It avoids the shopping list structure, where you present fact after fact after fact. Your audience will remember very little of this sort of talk because it presents a mass of detail and the focus is not clear.\r\n\r\nYou do need to read a lot to discover the overview off the topic, what is important, and what are the significant debates that are going on around this topic. You may need to answer questions on the spot, so you will need deep knowledge to draw from.\r\n\r\nFrom the background that you have gained from your reading, it is up to you to decide what to include in the talk. Avoid looking to one book and structuring your talk around it\u2019s headings, chapters or sections. Take a wider perspective. You are now the expert, you decide on the most interesting and important ideas to include in your talk.Because you are the expert, you determine where the talk goes. Don\u2019t tell the audience what information is in the book for its own sake. Be selective and tell them what is important and most interesting, and tell them what the literature says about this. because different research journals often do not agree with one another.\r\n\r\nActually, the topics where there is disagreement are places to be explored rather than avoided. These are often the most engaging. If you do have any personal or professional experience in the topic, that is fantastic! Draw on this as well, but be sure to make clear where ideas are from your own perspective, and what things are actually from research. Include an activity if you can \u2013 if your audience is small enough to fit in a classroom.This will allow you to have some personal interaction. It is always more engaging if you can get the audience involved.\r\n\r\nYour time is limited, so this need not be an activity on a large scale. You can get people to just \u201cthink of a time when\u201d, or get the people to turn to the person next to them to discuss something for a minute, or make list of five things related to your topic. The tighter your schedule is, the less flexibility you will have with participation. But it adds a great deal in communicating your message.\r\n\r\nHandouts may be a required part of your assessment. If you do not have a PowerPoint projector available, it may be helpful for your audience to have a visual guide or a program of what you will cover. Handouts like this can support your talk and the audience can have them in front of them while you are delivering your presentation. It can be useful for the audience to have a handout for other reaasons: it might be a part of one of your activities, or it may provide stats or formulae, because these may be difficult to express verbally or to copy down.\r\n\r\nHandouts could also add to your talk by giving further information. This may include more details that you could not fit onto your talk, .or further readings or so on. However, handouts giving further information are not always a good idea to give out beforehand because they will take the audience's attention away from your presentation.\r\n\r\nJust remember, an oral presentation is not like an essay. Do not think you would be able to cram in all the detail you would be able to put into a two-thousand-word text. You need to keep it simple, and in an oral presentation, you need to reinforce ideas a lot more.\r\n\r\nIf you are daunted by the idea of standing and talking for five to ten minutes, you will be surprised how little time this actually is when you have plenty to say \u2013 it goes very quickly. It is important to practice over and over again. And do this as you intend to do on the day. A full dress rehearsal is very necessary. This must be out loud, full volume, and with all the slides and charts you are planning to use. Practice with an audience if possible. Make sure you time yourself as you practices as well.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]","excerpt":"Watching this series of four videos gives you an overview to preparing for a group presentation, how to structure your presentation, presentation skills and having a clear message.

If, on the other hand, you decided to have pet mice, the same space would accommodate probably thousands of them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when converting from a large unit to a small unit, you can have more of them. This means that the number increases, which means the decimal point will move right. In the example, one microgram which is the larger unit is being converted to mcg which is smaller, from milli to micro you will need to\u00a0 move the decimal point three places, and that is three places to the right. On the other hand, one mouse only takes up a small part of an elephant.So if you're converting from a small unit to a large unit you will not have many... You'll only have a small fraction.\r\n\r\nIn this example, we are changing three milligrams (which is now the smaller of the two units) to grams (which is the larger of the\u00a0 two units). From milligrams to grams there is a factor of 1000, this mean moving the decimal point three places. The number gets smaller by a fraction of 1000 so it is now three places to the left.\r\n\r\nSo when going to a larger unit to a smaller unit\u2014such as grams to milligrams\u2014the number that you have will get larger and this means that the decimal point shifts to the right.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, If you are going to a smaller unit to a larger unit\u2014such as microlitres to litres\u2014the number that you have will get smaller and this means shifting the decimal point to the left.

This means that a larger person needs a larger dose of the drug. It means that the amount you give is not a standard dosage but, rather, depends on the body mass of the patient.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the patient will need 12 milligrams of the drug for each kilogram of their body, and don't forget that this is what they need per day. Do n't neglect this last unit! Other examples may specify that this has to be given per dose or per hour, so please keep this one in mind.\r\n\r\nLet's just focus on this information first. We know that the patient is 60 kilograms, and as soon as you have a patient with a specific body weight, you need to determine how much of the drug we will give to this particular patient. We know from the dosage label that for every kilo of their body mass, we need to give 12 milligrams of the medication. Clearly, that will be 60 lots of 12 milligrams. 60 times 12 is 720, and remember that is per day.\r\n\r\nYou can visualise this in the following way: Think of the 60 kilogram patient, and then, visualise them consisting of 60 separate kilograms of body mass. To each kilogram, we need to deliver 12 milligrams of the medication. 60 times 12 gives us a total of 720 milligrams. And, as I said before, that is per day.\r\n\r\nYou can show your working in the following way: 60 kilograms multiplied by 12 milligrams per kilogram. The kilograms cancel, so that the unit you are left with is milligrams. That is, 720 milligrams.\r\n\r\nOnce you have achieved this single amount, it is unnecessary to think of the dosage in terms of milligrams per kilogram anymore\u2026 Until you are faced with another patient, of course.

Flow rate is determined by the volume of liquid that passes by (into a patient) within a certain time period. This is the fundamental formula for all IV problems.\r\n\r\nThis short video uses practical examples to explain the formula for calculating the flow rate of a medication infusion.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/utjPFpToNjU?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form, this is the formula for finding the flow rate of an infusion. You need to know the volume of the liquid flowing into the patient and divide this by the time it takes. The volume will be measured in units of some variations of litres, millilitres, or microlitres. And time will be measured in hours or minutes, or could theoretically be calculated in seconds... But this would not be a time unit that would be very practical in nursing. What is important to remember, however, is the units put into the one formula are compatible. That means that if the flow rate is measured in mls per hour, the volume must be measured in terms of mls and the time must be in terms of hours.\r\n\r\nIf the flow rate is in microlitres per second, the time will be in seconds, and the volume will be put into the formula in microlitres. If the flow rate is in terms of drops per minute, the volume would have to be in drops. Mls and drops are both ways to measure volume, but they are still different units. To have flow rates in drops per minute, you would have to convert the mls value to a value of drops before you put it in. And likewise, the time needs to be in minutes, so if you have time in hours, you would have to convert it before you put it into the formula.\r\n\r\nThe formula, as it is, gives you a way to calculate the flow rate if you already have the volume and the time. However, you can calculate any of the three factors as long as you have the other two. The formula can be rearranged so that you calculate either the volume or the time, if these are the missing quantities. The triangle on the left hand side of the screen may help you derive any other helpful formulae. We can see how flow rate can be achieved using volume on time.\r\n\r\nIf we want to calculate volume and we are given the flow rate and the time, we would multiply these together\u2026 And if we need to find the time after we are given the volume and flow rate, then time equals volume divided by flow rate.\r\n\r\nLet's put this formula to use. Here we have a problem whereby we know the volume of the liquid to be infused into the patient and we know the flow rate. The missing factor here is the time, the volume is 100 mls, and the flow rate is 25 mls per hour, and the formula for time is volume divided by flow rate. Plugging those values in, 100 mls divided by 25 mls per hour, the mls will cancel.\r\n\r\nNotice here we have a fraction within the fraction and in that the 25 ml per hour is in the denominator. So the denominator of the denominator, that is the hours here, gets flipped up and multiplies out the numerator. 100 divided by 25 is 4 and the unit now at the top is hours.In our next problem, we need to find the time again, but this time we are given the volume in mls and the flow rate in drops per minute. What is more, we for the time in terms of hours. Unfortunately, we cannot have hours and minutes in the same formula, so we will have to get our answer for time in minutes first, and then at the very end we can turn the minutes into hours, if that's what's needed. Similarly, the mls and the drops cannot exist together in the same formula, so one of them will have to change. We could turn 100 mls into 2000 drops, or we could change the 10 drops into half a ml. Either of these will bring us to the same answer.\r\n\r\nI will turn the 10 drops into mls, so we have mls in the formula. This allows for the mls to be cancelled. The minutes at the bottom of the denominator get flipped to the top again, and minutes is clearly the unit that our answer will be in. 100 divided by a half is 200, that is 200 minutes, and 200 minutes is three-and-a-third of a hour, or three hours and 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Flow rate activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nA machine can fill 1 bottle every 2 seconds.

Find out how this is managed mathematically.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CwJ7CBI_TwY?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nOur first problem is that we have an infusion running over 15 minutes and 50 mls of the infusion is being administered to the patient. We want to calculate the flow rate, and this answer needs to be in mls per hour.\r\n\r\nOur formula for flow rate is volume divided by time, and we know the volume going into the patient, which is 50 mls of infusion, and we know that it is 15 minutes for the time. But if we keep going here, our answer will clearly be in mls per minutes and not mls per hour. We need to change the 15 minutes to hours and we do know that 15 minutes is quarter of an hour. So let's put that in, even though it looks a little strange to have an fraction within a fraction.\r\n\r\nWhat this is actually saying is how many quarters are in 50? Or what is 50 divided by one quarter? Now, you cannot cancel across a division sign and we cannot divide any numbers here. The next step is to turn the division sign into a multiplication sign, and flip the second fraction upside-down. So, as you see here, the problem turns into 50 times 4 because the second fraction - the quarter - gets turned upside-down. Now there is nothing we can cancel, but we can go ahead and just multiply.\r\n\r\nFifty times four is 200. That's no surprise when you think about it, because there are four quarters in everyone and we have 50 of them. So 50, how many quarters, would be 50 times 4. And the mls unit is still on the top and the hours the denominator.\r\n\r\nThis time we have a similar problem, but the infusion this time is administered over 45 minutes. Once again, we need the formula flow rate equals volume over time. Once again the volume is 50 mls, and in this problem the time is 45 minutes. Once again, we need to change the minutes to hours. Similar to last time, we can change the 45 minutes to three quarters of an hour. This looks a little bit more complicated but we treat it the same way. It is really saying 50 mls divided by three-quarters of an hour. Like last time, we changed the division sign to times and flipped the second fraction. Three-quarters upside down is four-thirds, we can try to cancel if we can, but 3 does not divide nicely into 50, so we just multiply through.\r\n\r\n50 multiplied by 4 makes 200, and then divide this by 3. It comes down to a decimal of 66.6 recurring, which can be rounded to 66.7 mls per hour, and if you want to round it to the nearest whole ml, than it will be 67 mls per hour. We have the same problem as we had in the first slide, where we have a 50 mil infusion running over 15 minutes again. Once again, we need to turn the 15 minutes into hours, but this time we will not use fractions, we'll use a decimal. And 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, and a quarter as a decimal is 0.25. Now, decimals within fractions do not work very well, but what you can do is turn that fraction into an equivalent fraction. That means a fraction that reduces down to the same thing, but the number inside it are proportionally bigger. We just need to use the numbers that are not complicated with a decimal points.\r\n\r\nHere's how we do it: if we jump that annoying decimal point to the right in the 0.25, it is okay as long as we increase the numerator in the same way, that is, we jump the decimal points in both numbers. That will give us 500 over 2.5, which is still difficult, so let's move it another place to the right. And, what you do to the denominator you must do the same to the numerator. And that will give us 5000 over 25. This is equivalent, the numbers are bigger but the fraction overall comes down to the same thing that we started with. And most importantly, we are now dealing with only whole numbers within our fraction. So 5000 mls divided by 25 hours... This is straightforward long division, 5000 divided by 25 equals 200. And as we expected, the answer is 200 mls per hour.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Fractions and decimals activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nA square is divided into four equal parts.

Discover what \u2018drop factor\u2019 means, and how to convert between millilitres and drops.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sAajUofVftU?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nIn getting medication, we are constantly talking about millilitres. It helps to understand what a ml actually is, a ml measures a volume of liquid. If you can imagine a cube of water that measures one centimetre\u2026 by one centimetre... by one centimetre... then this is 1 ml. One cubic centimetre of liquid is one millilitre.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that same cubic centimetre divided into 20 separate drops, drops that are large enough to pack tightly into that same cubic centimetre of space. Here we have 20 drops in that space, we have 20 drops for that 1 ml of liquid. In other words, we have 20 drop per ml. This is your drop factor for macro drops, take note of the units here because the drop factor has units, the units of drop factor are drops per ml.\r\n\r\nThe unit of drops on its own is another way to express a volume of liquid, just as you can express a price in dollars or you could express it in Japanese yen or euros, both describe the same value but they are in different units, mls or drops. You can convert one to the other if you have the conversion rate - which is a little bit like the drop factor here. But you need to clearly state what you have - weather it's drops or mls or euros or dollars.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have 1 ml of liquid you the equivalent of 20 drops. If you have 2 ml of liquid you have 2 times 20, that is 40 drops. If you have 5 mls of liquid, you have 5 lots of 20, that is 100 drops.\r\n\r\nSee if you can make these conversions: 7 ml is equivalent to 7 times 20, which is 140 drops. 10 ml will give you 10 times 20, which is 200 drops. 50 ml, each containing 20 drops gives you 5 times 2 is 10, and 2 extra zeros, that's a 1000 drops. Same thing with the 80 ml, 8 times 2 is 16 and then 2 extra zeros, becomes 1600 drops. Finally, 120 mls multiplied by 20, gives us 2400 drops.[Stop]\r\n\r\nIn short, if you want to convert from mls to drops and this is when dealing with an adult patient and you are using macro drops, you multiply the number of mls by 20. If on the other you have drops and you want to convert back to mls. You do the opposite to multiply, which is to divide by 20.\r\n\r\nFor example, 600 drops converted back to mls, requires you to divide 600 by 20, after cancelling zeros we get an answer of 30. So 600 drops is equivalent to 30 mls. If you have 430 drops and you want to convert them to mls, you again divide the 430 by 20, it doesn't go evenly this time, it is equal to 21 and a half, which should be expressed as 21.5. 430 drops equals 21.5 mls.\r\n\r\nFinally, please remember that we have been dealing with macro drops, which are the larger size drops for adult infusions. If you are dealing with a paediatric patient, the infusion may be in micro drops, these drops are smaller and they are so small that 60 of them fit into the 1 ml of liquid (where before we had 20). So that means we have 60 drops per ml when dealing with micro drops, and 60 drops per ml is your drop factor for paediatric infusions. This means that converting between mls and drops for micro drops would require multiplying and dividing, not by 20 but rather by 60.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Drops activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nThere are 20 drops in 1mL, this is contained in one box.

In the previous video, we looked at converting between millilitres (ml) and drops. This time we are converting not only the volumes, (drops and mls) but the units for time as well.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Wjplzz2wpH0?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nFlow rate keeps a measure of how much liquid is flowing by for each unit of time. We need to know an amount of liquid, be it mls or drops, and the time unit it takes to flow, be it hours or minutes. mls per hour and drops per minute are the units that you will commonly work with. They can express the same amount and you can and should be able to convert between them.\r\n\r\nThe strength of expressing your flow rate in mls per hour is that you get a clearer idea of how much liquid volume is being added to the patient's system. The beauty of having flow rate in drops per minute is that you can more easily calibrate how much medication is going in and how quickly. And also you can judge that visually by counting and timing the drops.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be able to make very fine calibrations like this, especially when dealing with children. In addition, your instrumentation will determine what unit that you must use and so that you need to be able to convert between the units and set your instruments according to their needs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to convert flow rate in mls per hour to flow rate in drops per minute you will need a couple of conversion factors to do this. Firstly, we want to turn mls into drops, and we know that there are 20 drops per ml.\r\n\r\nWe want to get rid of the mls so we should put that at the bottom and the drops value can go on the top. We also want to turn the hours into minutes. One hour equals 60 minutes. So we will put the hour on the top, so we can cancel it and the minutes that we want can go on the denominator of our conversion factor. So, we notice that after the cancelling we have multiplied the numerator by 20 and the denominator by 60. Let's merge those together and 20 over 60 simplifies down to one-third.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a flow rate in mls per hour and you multiply it by third you will get a flow rate in drops per minute, and that's the case for whatever the original flow rate may be, but remember that is only true when 20 drops is equivalent to 1 ml, and that this is when it's for an IV for an adult size patient.\r\n\r\nSo from this we know that flow rate in mls per hour, can be converted to drops per minute by multiplying the value by one-third. If you want to go from drops per minute back to mls per hour, you do the opposite, which is to divide by a third. But that is effectively the same as multiplying by 3\u2026 But remember, this is only true for macro drops, which are the drops used by adult infusions.\r\n\r\nLet's recall our understanding of macro drops and micro drops. Macro drops for adult infusions are of other size, such as there are 20 drops per mil. For paediatric infusions on the other hand - drops are much smaller, there are 60 drops making up that one mil, and the drop factor is 60 drops per ml\r\n\r\nSo, if we are dealing with micro drops and we want to turn flow rate into mls per hour into microdrops per minute, we can follow the same sort of calculation we did before. But we do not use 20 drops-per-mil we use 60-drops-per-mil. The difference is though, this time we are multiplying the numerator by 60 drops, and the denominator by 60 minutes\u2026 Once again we can merge them together, and 60 on 60 is one.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Converting flow activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nAssuming you are using macrodrops 20 drops\/ml, complete the following equations by filling in the gaps.

Do you need help deciding what sort of incident you should select? Are you clear on what a variable is? This series of videos covers how to structure and write a critical incident reflection.\r\n\r\nPart 1: The preliminary guide\r\nThis video gives an overview of the assignment, some of the pitfalls to avoid and an outline of a sample critical incident.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nAs a professional, it's always good to work reflectively, always being mindful of how you impact those around you and trying to see other people's perspectives and situations. In your future professional life, there will be times when mistakes or disagreements occur and you may be called upon to negotiate or investigate these. If you do, you need to do this keeping emotions in control, taking a situation apart in a scientific way, and understanding what has led to the situation.\r\n\r\nIf you are in a position of authority, you may be called upon to document an incident in writing, and put in place procedures that will avoid an undesirable situation from happening again.\r\n\r\nBefore you start anything, you need to identify your incident first. Students often think that this assignment requires an incident that is disastrous or life-changing. Actually, this is not what you need to do, because for one, these things are usually too complex and emotional, and also they are often not based on misunderstandings of any type. You need to select a fairly mundane event, such as a minor conflict with a work colleague, or a harsh exchange with the cashier at the supermarket. What's important is that you need to be critical, not choose a crisis.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the incident that you choose needs to be about a failure to communicate, or a failure to understand each other, or perhaps a failure of the system that has led to a conflict or a difficulty between parties.\r\n\r\nGive a minimum amount of detail of what happened, give only what's necessary to understand the analysis or reflection that will follow. Retelling the story does not achieve a lot, it's the analysis and reflection that matters. If you feel that you really need to give a more detailed description, put that in the appendix and just use a brief summary in the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe incident that you select needs to be very specific. Something you can identify at a particular time and a particular place. Once you've chosen your incident, you need to unpack the situation.Choose a true situation rather than a fabricated one, because that will make this part much easier. It will also sound more authentic in the end. You need to use a common sense, reflective approach to list everything that contributed to the situation.\r\n\r\nFor example, I've analysed a disagreement that I had at home last week. The blue boxes around the edge are the things that contributed to the situation. You should recognise that many of them involve the variables suggested in your assignments. Variables such as environment where the argument took place, or the different cultural values of the people involved. But remember, your situation is unique. The variables suggested may be relevant or they may not. You need to engage with the situation and really sort out what the variables are of your situation. Some of them may not even be on the list.\r\n\r\nOnce you've pulled your situation apart and analysed what went on, you need to link your thoughts or conclusions to the literature. Remember though, it is a reflective piece, and a reflection is based on your thoughts and feelings first. It is not based on the literature. In a way, this report is a case study, and the case is always central to the writing, be it a patient, or in this assignment, it is an incident.\r\n\r\nAn essay is based primarily on literature,. however, a case study or a reflective writing piece is not. In this report, you need to make links to the literature in saying what you want to say. But do not let the literature dominate. Let it support what you want to say, or your message will become unclear. Always keep your story and your analysis upfront and central.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nPart 2: Incorporating the literature\r\nThis assignment involves reflecting on YOUR particular incident, but at the same time you need to integrate relevant information from the literature. This video will provide some guidance of how this can be done.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nLet's return to my situation from the previous video, where I was analysing a disagreement I had with my husband about our teenage daughter going away overnight. Let's just focus on a few of the aspect variables of this case. First of all, my husband and I bring different ideas to the table about what it means to be a parent. To explore this deeply, I might refer to key terms such as these. These might draw from a wide variety of fields such as psychology and in particular, parenting, of course.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this case is that we'd heard. So our assumptions and perceptions play a big part in this incident. To explore this more deeply, we might talk about adolescents and peer pressure. This may draw from many fields that look at how adolescents think and behave, what detrimental behaviours they may indulging in, and what percentage are actually doing so. Another aspect that I will explore is that my husband grew up in a fairly traditional Greek immigrant family. Now, as a father, he presents many different ideas and values that he was raised in. To explore the differences that this creates, I might need to read something about Greek culture, their social values, and their concepts of honour and gender roles for women. Now, this is certainly not something that you would go looking for before you had your incident worked out.\r\n\r\nWhen you go looking for references, books are a good place to start. They are easier to understand when you first get into a topic, and they will give you the general idea. Their limitations, however, are that they do not go into anything very deeply. They do not have the depth and detail that a research paper needs at university level, and the higher you go in tertiary study, the truer this becomes. Most books are on the shelf for a number of years, as well. In medicine and nursing, there is a need to limit your resources that have been published in the last five years. The reason for this is that the medical field is evolving so rapidly that most technology, techniques, and drugs are completely different even after just a few years. In medicine, five years is a long time.\r\n\r\nIn other fields however, this is a little more relaxed. In fields such as psychology, or education, ten years would be acceptable, but the more recent the reference, the better it is, of course. So when you select your references, keep the field in mind because the requirements for medical references are quite stringent, and the five-year rule might exclude some useful and appropriate references from other disciplines. Apply your common sense to this, and if unsure, don't hesitate to ask a lecturer from the field.\r\n\r\nThe internet is another useful source. But as you know, anyone can create a webpage, so be careful. Look at the fine print at the bottom of the page, which often includes the date the web page was last modified, and make sure the website is controlled by a reputable authority or institutions. Blogs, wikis, and dot com sites which aim to sell things to you are not suitable for academic references.The best references are peer-reviewed research journals, which you search for and can access through the databases of the library. These are reputable and contain sufficient depth and detail. However, journals \u2013 whether they are electronic or paper-based \u2013 are not good places to start your research. They usually detail very specific studies that were carried out, and their language and findings are quite specialised. They are something to tackle when one, you have some familiarity to the topic, and two, you know exactly what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nSo, what now? Ponder your incident deeply and reflectively. Perhaps discuss it with a friend to get another person's insights into it, and then write it out all in one go. Forget the references for the time being. This will give you the structure of your critical incident report, and this could be done in a few hours.\r\n\r\nAfter that, read it over and see where your references could inform or expand on some of the things that you have touched on. Since this is largely about communication, change, and personal growth, there are any number of theorists that can give you a structure for analysing your incident. You might like to refer to their categories and analyses when thinking about what went on in your incident. I would, however, use them sparingly, because you would also have to explain their theory, even briefly, and this could chew up a lot of word space.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nPart 3: Structures for reflective writing\r\nAvoid a rambling stream of consciousness that recounts what happened when. There is a structure to the writing process as well as the reflective process. View this video to see what you need to think about and say in regard to your incident.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nReflection is a creative process and does not always follow a linear logic in the same way that essays or reports do. However, reflection is still an academic genre of writing and it's necessary to follow a structure. First and foremost, your reflection still needs to be written in paragraph form - just like any other genre of academic writing, which always requires structured paragraphs. Secondly, the process of thinking reflectively can be structured as well; however, it depends upon the individual and the situation as to how this is done in the end.\r\n\r\nA possible framework for a reflective process is the D.I.E.P. model. This is only advisory; however, it does touch on every aspect of thinking reflectively. At the very least it may generate some avenues to explore with your reflection.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018D' in the \u2018DIEP' stands for describe. It is necessary that you first describe the situation you're reflecting on. Do note, however, that this does need to be kept as brief as possible. Describe what you only need to describe so that your reader can follow the rest of your reflection. Recounting the details of your incident does not constitute reflection per se. It would be a mistake to let the description of your incident go beyond a quarter of the word space.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the structure, is the \u2018I' for interpret. This is where you state the significance of what happened, what does it mean for you, or how does it impact you. A similar situation can occur for two people, but it will affect them differently because they interpret the event differently.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018E' stands for evaluation. In this space, you can make judgement on things. This may be on the outcomes of the situation on the people involved in the confrontation, or, most importantly, on yourself and on your own behaviour. Whatever your evaluation of a person or situation is, it needs to be balanced and supported by reasoning. Do not make judgements from a position of blame but rather towards the goal of understanding. And remember, evaluations in the real world are seldom black and white. There will be shades of grey, composites of good and bad, or successful and unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018P' in DIEP is for planning, and this is the section where you can look forward towards your reflection. This is where you think about the next time, how the experience has changed you, or exactly what you need to do or want to achieve in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, although reflective writing is another type of academic writing. You are allowed to, unlike other forms, use the pronoun \u2018I'. You would not mention yourself in an essay, or a report, however, it is valid to say \u2018I feel', or \u2018I believe' in a reflection. Because this after all, is the focus of a reflective writing. None the less, your lecturer may ask you to write to the third person. Saying, the author thinks or this writer believes. Because this makes the text sound more objective and it may give you a more analytical or detailed stance as well.\r\n\r\nParagraphing is a very important feature in your writing \u2013like any other genre of academic writing. Reflection needs to be structured, logical and clear. It is not written as a stream of consciousness where each idea merges into the next. Ideas need to be identified and separated by paragraphing. And the initial sentence, known as the topic sentence, clearly states the concept to be delivered in each paragraph.\r\n\r\nIn each paragraph in a reflective writing piece, the following sentences will expand on the ideas stated in the topic sentence. They might be citing the literature relevant to the topic sentence; they might be given to reflection, exploring your feelings and beliefs in relation to the topic sentence. The final sentence is termed to a linked sentence; it can summarise and make sense all of the detail given in the paragraph so far. It brings the information back into context, with the confrontation or misunderstanding you're writing about. I call it the \u2018so-what' line, right what you would if somebody asked you, \"well\u2026 so what?\".\r\n\r\nAlthough the linked sentence is not mandatory, it is a very good idea for long paragraphs. It also a very good idea in reflective writing because it makes you anchor your reflections and literature back to the real incident \u2013which is what the assignment is all about.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nPart 4: Sample paragraphs\r\nIf you are still unsure about what to do, watch how a sample incident can be analysed.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nJust to recap, I am reflecting on an argument that was introduced in the previous session. I had had an argument with my husband about our teenage daughter staying out overnight. I identified several of the variables that fit into and exacerbated argument. The one I will focus on here is the notion that my husband and I approach parenting in different ways. In short, what happens in my reflection is that I identify exactly how my husband and I differ in parenting, and. I find some categories in the literature to describe these differences.\r\n\r\nThrough the literature and further reflection, I realise that parenting differently is not a huge issue and, in fact, it is almost impossible to have complete consensus in parenting styles. I realise that my need to agree with my husband on all issues dealing with my daughter, was making me frustrated, and this probably made the argument worse.\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph sets the context part of this reflection. No deep reflection is being entered into as yet. The topic sentence highlights the key point of the paragraph. Namely that my husband and I often approach parenting issues in different ways. The first reference I use is quite old, from 1971. But this particular reference is the first time the categories for parenting styles were coined. So, it is considered a classic work in the field. In the next sentence in blue, I relate the information gained in the literature to the present situation.\r\n\r\nRemember the incident is central to the writing, so. there is no point in including literature that has little direct relevance to your incident. Always explain how the literature reveals something about the situation, and as I did in the next sentence in black font. Find some literature that describes or expands on your situation. You need to keep a continuous conversation between the literature and the details of the incident. The final sentence in this paragraph is what I call the link sentence. It sums up the point of what I'm saying in the paragraph and it should correspond to the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph, once again the topic sentences are in red. This is the cracks of the issue here, then I immediately relate it to what this means in the confrontation we had; and I've done this in the blue. Where possible, I relate the literature to my situation as shown in the black text. I then move onto some reflection as shown in the green text section. Here, I explore why different parenting style issue was an issue in the confrontation at all. I finish with the linking sentence which makes sense of this reflection. It brings things down to earth and back to the real world and more importantly the incident that we are analysing in the first place. It also returns to the point established in the topic sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph, the core part of the sentence is shown in red. The key point of this topic sentence is that I always felt that I had to agree on my husband about parenting. In the text in green, I start to move into some analytical reflection, where I look back at my own thinking and possibly question the things that I'd believed. Be sure to explore what you feel and believe. Question it, do not just state it. Dig down deep, and find out why you feel and believe the way that you do. In the black text section, I find some literature that talks about consensus in parenting styles but I need to immediately bring that back to what it tells me about my situation as a I do in the last line in blue. What it does tell me is that, lots of couples exhibit different parenting styles, this sentence is not a linked sentence summing up the paragraph. But it does move the reader onto the next section where I will talk further about having different parenting styles.\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph marks a shift in my understanding of the situation. Reading the literature has caused me to reflect further and deeper; and there's no reason why this cannot feed into the reflective process as well. My realisation is expressed in the topic sentence, shown in red. Namely whatever we do, my husband and I will always be perceived differently. And this is followed by a number of sources that expand and further this idea.\r\n\r\nIn the final paragraph I have managed to come to some resolution that will move me forward. The final stage of the reflective process can be denoted as the planning phase. This means that we might think about where to next? with the issue; or how this understanding may change our behaviour in the future. You may or may not get to this stage with your reflection of your incident. It's not completely necessary that you do. Here, however, I have arrived at the understanding that common parenting approaches are not as important as I had previously thought. And as I reflect in green, what I really hope for is to have open communication between the three of us.\r\n\r\nThe final sentence is the link sentence \u2013 it echoes the idea started in the topic sentence by saying that the argument was made worse by my anxiety, which was mostly unnecessary. More importantly it brings the reader back to the incident or confrontation \u2013 which is what the assignment is all about. A reflection can go in many directions exploring ideas and feelings surrounding the incident, but, the paragraph will be much stronger if the reflection turns to the incident to clarify how it changes our understanding of the specific incident\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, although this is a reflective piece it should not be written as a long meandering chain of thought. It requires structure and paragraphing. Just like any other academic writing. So, use topic sentences and use linked sentences in order to bring up the ideas back to the situation. Keep that conversation going between the literature and the critical situation. Constantly relate one to the other, do not discuss literature or a theory that has no impact upon the critical incident.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, reflect deeply and delve into the reasons of your feelings. Do not just identify them, and be open to the literature changing your views and understandings. At first you need to link your reflections to the literature, but this can be a cyclic process where the literature feeds back into your reflections as well. This, however, means that your writing could get quite long, so the key here is to limit the scope of your incident in the first place. Select a simple confrontation, because it is better to reflect deeply on a few variables rather than spreading your focus across a complex matter \u2013 making the reflection too broad and too shallow.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Are you wondering what reflective writing is about?

Real-life examples are used throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tFinding the volume required\r\nWhat is volume required formula? This formula tells us how much liquid-form medication we need to give a patient, considering the strength they need and the source that it comes from. This tutorial introduces the volume required formula and shows you how to apply it to a problem.\r\n \tUsing proportions with liquid solutions\r\nIf you need double the dose of medication, you need to give double the volume of the liquid that it is dissolved in and so on. This is the simple principle behind the volume required formula. Learn how you could solve these problems before applying the formula.\r\n \tConverting between large and small units\r\nHow do you convert between units? Nurses use units that begin with milli and micro a lot. If you express your dosage in a smaller unit, the number must get bigger, and vice versa. Find out how to convert dosages between larger and smaller units.\r\n \tMedication dosage by body weight\r\nHow do you deal with a unit like mg\/kg? Milligrams per kilogram means that you must give a certain amount (mgs) of a drug for each kilogram of the patient\u2019s body mass. Bigger patients need a bigger dose! Learn what this unit means and when and how to use it.\r\n \tThe flow rate formula\r\nWhat does \"flow rate = volume\/time mean\"? Flow rate is determined by the volume of liquid that passes by (into a patient) within a certain time period. This is the fundamental formula for all IV problems.\r\n \tManaging fractions and decimals\r\nWhat do you do if the flow rate calculation involves fractions such as \u00bc of an hour or 0.5 litres? Find out how this is managed mathematically.\r\n \tDrop factor: converting between millilitres and drops\r\nDrops are just another unit for measuring the amount of fluid flowing into a patient\u2019s system. Discover what \u2018drop factor\u2019 means, and how to convert between millilitres and drops.\r\n \tConverting flow rates between mL\/hr and dpm\r\nHow do you convert IV flow rates? In the previous video, we looked at converting between millilitres (ml) and drops. This time we are converting not only the volumes, (drops and mls) but the units for time as well.

It explains how to define the formula for calculating medication dosage, how to understand the formula structure and how to use the formula with practical examples provided.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CI95_lU61hI?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nThe volume required formula combines two key sorts of values. Firstly, there are the values for drug strength. Think of that as the mass of the drug\u2026 The more of the drug you have\u2026 the stronger the dose is. The amount of medication\u2014which is often in powder form in its original state\u2014gives an indication of the dosage. Mass is measured in units such as kilograms or grams, but, of course, in medication, this is more likely to be in milligrams or micrograms.\r\n\r\nAnother way to measure the amount of mass of a medication is units. That is, there is an alternative to milligrams or micrograms and it's called units.The other value that the formula uses is volume\u2026 Volume measures the amount of liquid. For example, a bottle contains one litre of water or 600 mls of juice. Litres, millilitres, and microlitres are units of volume.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of drug, 100 milligrams for example, can be diluted to any number of volumes. You might put 100 milligrams of drug into 1 ml of liquid for an intravenous injection. Or you might put 100 milligrams of drug into a 500 ml bag of saline, which will be infused into a patient over a period of hours.\r\n\r\nThe milligrams indicates the amount of the drug that the patient receives. The mLs, then, indicates the volume of the liquid. The milligrams per ml indicates the concentration of the solution.Milligrams per ml is the unit for the concentration of the solution. A few milligrams put into a small volume of mls creates a high concentration. A few milligrams put into a large volume creates a low concentration.\r\n\r\nSo, with this formula, you are seeking the volume required... You want to know how much of the medication solution you should give to the patient\u2026 This depends on the strength required, which is how many milligrams or micrograms of the drug the patient must be given.\r\n\r\nThe stock strength is how many milligrams or micrograms of the drug there are in the original bottle, or ampoule, or capsule. And, finally, the stock volume tells us how much liquid is in the original bottle, or ampoule, or capsule.\r\n\r\nAll in all, what we are finding is the proportion of the drug we need out of what we have available to begin with. And that is the proportion\u2014or the fraction\u2014that we want out of the original stock bottle of liquid... Put simply, if we only need half of the drug that is available in the bottle, then we only need half of the liquid solution that it comes in!\r\n\r\nWhen preparing a medication of a prescribed strength, you need to know how much of the liquid solution you need to draw up. The volume of the solution required can be be calculated using this formula. Using the strength of the drug required, the strength available, and finding the volume that is available in the stock bottle, vial, or ampoule\u2026 And it can be written in the abbreviated form like this...\r\n\r\nIt is useful, though, to understand why the formula has this shape. The formula is helpful, but, what is more important is the logic behind the formula, and if you understand that for simple calculations, you may not need to rely on the formula.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample problem to solve: The doctor has ordered 25 milligrams of Drugafloxin. This drug is available in solution form\u2026 And there is 100 milligrams of the drug in 120 mls of liquid solution in the vial. Now, thinking about this first\u2026 We only need 25 out of the available 100 milligrams. That is only one quarter of the strength. We need one quarter\u2014or one fourth\u2014of the available solution. So, consequently, we only need one quarter of the liquid that it comes in. One quarter of 120mls is\u2026 30 mls. Let's demonstrate this.\r\n\r\nWe only need 25 milligrams out of the total 100 milligrams of the Drugafloxin, so we only need the same proportion of the liquid. A quarter of the original 120 mls will be 30 mls\u2026 And hopefully that is the answer that we calculate. Now let's write this down using the formula. So the fraction of the drug needed out of what is available is the same as the fraction of the volume needed, out of what is available. And now for some clever algebra: if we want to get the volume required on one side of the equal side on it's own, then we can multiply that side with the stock volume. But we must do this to both sides if want to keep the equation balanced. And why did we do this? This gives us the opportunity to cancel the stock volume on the left hand side of the equation, and there we have the equation in the form that we normally see it.\r\n\r\nThis is the form that is most useful for finding the value for the volume required, but the important message behind it... Is that whatever fraction you need out of the available drug strength... That is the same fraction you need out of the available volume of the medicated solution. The volume required is what we are looking for. The strength required is 25 milligrams\u2026 And the stock strength is 100 milligrams. Let's finish substituting into the formula and the stock volume is 120 mls.\r\n\r\nNow mg and mg cancel. 25 and 100 can cancel. 25 goes into 25 once, and into 100 four times. There is your quarter. Now we want a quarter of the 120 mls. We can cancel the four with the 120. Four goes into 120... 30 times. The remaining unit is mls. The volume required is 30 mls. We only need 25 out of the available 100 milligrams, that is only one quarter of the strength, so it makes sense that the amount of solution we need is also a quarter of the available solution.\r\n\r\nWe can understand that the proportion of the drug we need is equal to the proportion of the liquid we need in comparison to the drug amount or the liquid amount we have. We know we need 25 out of the 100 milligrams. This is equivalent to needing the 30 out of the 120 mls. Both of these proportions reduce to a quarter.\r\n\r\nLet's rearrange this equation to get the volume required on its own. We can do this if we multiply by stock volume or SV. But whatever we do to one side of the equation we must do to the other so that it keeps the equation balanced. On the left side, the SV will cancel.\u00a0\u00a0 One the right side it will remain. And there we have it, the usual form of the volume required formula. This more common form of the formula\u2013as well as the equal fractions shown above\u2013are both true. They are actually expressions of the same formula\u2026 They have just undergone some rearrangement. The message that is hiding inside these formulas is that the fraction of the drug you need out of what you have is the same fraction in terms of the liquid solution.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\nInstructions\r\nCategorise the following labels correctly into 'mass' or 'volume'.\r\n\r\n \tstrength\r\n \tgrams\r\n \tdrug amount\r\n \tmcg\r\n \ttabs\r\n \tunits\r\n \tliquid amount\r\n \tliters\r\n \tmcl\r\n \tcm3\r\n \tml\r\n \tquantity of saline\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\nMass:\r\n\r\n \tstrength\r\n \tgrams\r\n \tdrug amount\r\n \tmcg\r\n \ttabs\r\n \tunits\r\n\r\nVolume:\r\n\r\n \tliquid amount\r\n \tliters\r\n \tmcl\r\n \tcm3\r\n \tml\r\n \tquantity of saline\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Activity 2\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 2 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nMatch the following values of the formula to their descriptions.

The doctor has ordered 6 units out of the 10, so we need a fraction of 6 over 10.\r\n\r\nWe only need 0.6 of the vial or 60% of the vial, or 6\/10ths of the vial if you like. So 6\/10ths of one ml is 0.6 ml.\r\n\r\nHere, we have another drug and in this vial we have 300 mg of drug and it is in a solution of 15 mls. The quantity that you see below is actually a simplified version the same fraction, but I suspect that the vial that the label is on here actually has 15 ml in it. 300 over 15 is proportionally the same as 20 over 1, the fraction has just been simplified for you.\r\n\r\nSo, this time, the doctor has ordered 200 mg of the drug. We will not need the whole vial, or all of the amount, and this time 200\/300 is a fraction of two-thirds, so we need two-thirds of the bottle. Two-thirds of the 15 ml is equal to 10 ml. We will need 10 ml of solution.\r\n\r\nHere, we have another drug, and this time we have 100 mg of the drug and it is dissolved in 5ml of liquid. Once again, we have another reduction that 20 mg per ml is a reduced form of that fraction, but as we can see from this label, near the bottom, this is actually a 5ml bottle.\r\n\r\nSo, the doctor this time the doctor has order 50 mg out of the 100 mg. So 50\/100 mg is a fraction of 1\/2. We will only need half of the bottle, and half of the bottle this time means half of the 5 mls which is 2.5 mls.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we have another drug label. This time, we have a Caffeine Citrate Injection and we have 60 mgs of this medication, which is dissolved in 3 ml of the liquid. Again, we have the 20 mg\/1 ml as a simplification of that fraction. So the doctor this time has ordered 80 milligrams. That means we will be needing more than the one vial because the vial has only 3 ml in it and we will need 80 over 60. So 80 over 60 is more than 1, that is equivalent 4 over 3 and that is equal to one and one-third. We will need one and one-third of this medication. 4\/3 and 3 ml is 4 milligrams. If we cancel the threes there, we will need 4 ml of the liquid.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Labels activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nA vial label has a stock strength of 200mg and stock volume of 100ml.

This is a bottle of water and this bottle contains one litre of water... We are going to empty the sachet into the water so that it dissolves evenly.\r\n\r\n\"If I need to ingest 15 grams of GOFUEL\u2026 How much solution should I drink?\"... Most pure drug calculations will be of this form. Our sports coach has recommended that we take 15 grams of the GOFUEL powder. How much liquid do I need to have out of the ready made 1 litre solution? Let's clarify our variables.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is 15 grams of GOFUEL. What we have in the bottle is 40 grams of GOFUEL. The total volume of liquid in the bottle is a 1000 mls\u2026 And the amount of liquid we are required to drink is the quantity we are looking for.\r\n\r\nSo the volume of the liquid that we have is given this equation: the amount of GOFUEL we need over the amount of GOFUEL we have, as a fraction of the bottle's volume. So plugging those values into the formula gives us fifteen-fortieths of the 1000 millilitres.\r\n\r\n15 and 40 is divisible by 5, so they can cancel down to three-eighths... The volume we're required to drink is three-eighths of the 1000 millilitres. Three-eighths converted to a decimal form is 0.375, and multiplying that by 1000 gives us 375 mL. We need to drink 375 mL of the liquid to give us 15 millilitres of GOFUEL.\r\n\r\nNow, returning to our formula of what we need over what we have as a fraction of the bottled volume. This is normally expressed in this form. What we need is strength required and what we have available is the stock strength. The volume of the bottle is normally the stock volume.\r\n\r\nSo the volume of liquid we need to drink or receive is given by... The amount of drug powder that we want, divided by the amount of drug powder we have available in the bottle, as a fraction of the bottle volume that it comes in\u2026 And this is the formula in abbreviated form.\r\n\r\nVR stands for Volume Required, this is usually the amount being sought in the problem. SR represents the Strength Required as in how much go fuel powder you want to ingest, or how much medication you have been prescribed. Stock Strength is given by SS, which is how many grams or milligrams is in the bottle to begin off with. And SV is Stock Volume, which is how much liquid is in the bottle or, in other cases, is perhaps what is in vial or an IV bag.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Need\/have activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nIf the patient is prescribed 15mg of STATE, the strength of STAT at hand is 25mg and the volume of the bottle is 10mL.

This is the simple principle behind the volume required formula.\r\nLearn how you could solve these problems before applying the formula.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Y1cFDo__4og?rel=0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nLet's return to the GOFUEL mixture from a previous video. Let's recall that this is a sachet of GOFUEL, it is in powder form, and this sachet contains 40 grams of powder. This is a bottle of water and this bottle contains one litre of water. We're going to empty the sachet into the water so it dissolves evenly. And in this session, we are going to understand what the value of the concentration means.\r\n\r\nHere is our bottle with the sachet mixed evenly through... It's a nice blackcurrant flavour now. So we know that now that there is 40 grams of GOFUEL per litre of water. The concentration is just telling you about the proportion of solution that there is in the liquid or\u2014in the case of liquid medication\u2014what drug strength is in the liquid, if it is syrup-like, cough medicine, or saline for an IV.\r\n\r\nAnd, logically enough, the more liquid you administer, the more of the solute or the drug you receive in a proportional way. We can express the concentration in this way, as 40 grams per liter. One litre is equivalent to 1000 millilitres so we can express it this way\u2026 And that allows us to cancel some zeros from the numerator and the denominator, so that it is reduced to four grams per 100 milliliters.\r\n\r\nBecause four grams is also equivalent to 4000 micrograms, we can use the 4000 micrograms so we can express the concentration in this way. Remember, you always have to state your units, or else the number becomes meaningless. Once again, this allows us to cancel some zeros. And the concentration of our mixtures can be stated most simply this way. However, all of the above concentrations are equal and correct, it all depends on which units you want to use.\r\n\r\nSo the question is just how much go fuel powder does a person get if they drink a certain amount of liquid. It makes sense that if you drink the whole 1 L you'll take in 40 g of go fuel. What if you drink half of a litre, than you'll get half of the 40 g which is 20 mg; or maybe, 250 ml which is a quarter of a litre; then you will get a quarter of the total go fuel, which is 10 g. And if you had 200 mL which is a fifth of a bottle, you will get one-fifth of the 40 grams which is eight grams. Point 75 litres represents three-quarters of the litre bottle, and 75% or three-quarters of the GOFUEL bottle is 30 grams.\r\n\r\nWe could of solve these question in another way (keep in mind the other concentrations we calculated). We know for our sports drink solution that every mL contains 40 mg of go fuel; so if we have 500 millilitres of water, 500 lots of 40 mg is 20000 mg\u2014as we found before\u2014and notice that the mL cancel there leaving only the unit of mg.\r\n\r\nIf we drink 250 ml of the water, we will be receiving 250 lots of the 40 mg per mL, which is 10,000 mg; and the working out for that is similar. Now, if we drank 1250 ml of the liquid and that is more than we have in the bottle, but that's no problem because we can still focus how much go fuel we get if we had more of our blackcurrant mixture. 1250 x 40 is 50,000 mg -and the working out is the same again; and you could express that as 50,000 mg or 50 g if you prefer. But you must state the unit because it makes all the difference.\r\n\r\nSo, in all the concentration gives a measure of the medication for each unit of liquid. Using this you can figure out how much medication or in this case go fuel powder is in these certain amount of liquid. If you have one-third of the liquid for example, you'll have one-third of the medication and this relationship is proportional. What if a fraction you drink or receive out of the total, this is the same as the fraction of drug strength that you take out of the total available.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Proportions activity 1\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 1 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nArrange the following into the correct order from lowest to highest concentration:\r\n\r\n \t60mg\/10ml\r\n \t30mg\/10ml\r\n \t10mg\/10ml\r\n \t15mg\/10ml\r\n\r\nAnswer (from low to high):\r\n\r\n \t10mg\/10ml\r\n \t15mg\/10ml\r\n \t30mg\/10ml\r\n \t60mg\/10ml\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Proportions activity 2\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 2 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nArrange the following into the correct order from lowest to highest concentration:\r\n\r\n \t10mg\/5ml\r\n \t10mg\/75ml\r\n \t10mg\/500ml\r\n \t10mg\/250ml\r\n\r\nAnswer (from low to high):\r\n\r\n \t10mg\/500ml\r\n \t10mg\/250ml\r\n \t10mg\/75ml\r\n \t10mg\/5ml\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Proportions activity 3\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[transcript title=\"Activity 3 transcript\"]\r\n\r\nConvert the following to a concentration expressed per ml.

However, it is always expressed out of 100. This video will show you how to convert between fractions, decimals and percentages.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on percentages.\r\n\r\nA percentage means out of 100. For example, 25 percent means 25 out of 100 or 25 divided by a 100. Seven percent means seven divided by a 100 or seven out of 100. And 98 percent means 98 out of 100 or 98 divided by 100. Let\u2019s start by changing percentages into fractions. So the first one, 75 percent is 75 divided by 100. What we need to do is to break that down into smaller numbers, in other words we\u2019re simplifying the fraction, so let\u2019s divide by 25, top and bottom, and we get three divided by four, so 75 percent, as a fraction is three-quarters, similarly 40 percent is 40 divided by 100. Notice here that there are zeroes top and bottom, cancel one on the top with one on the bottom, that leaves us with four over 10 which cancels even further into two over five, so 40 percent is two-fifths.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at a large percentage and change this to a fraction, 175 percent is the same as 175 divided by 100, but now we turn this into a mixed fraction, which is one and 75 over 100. Notice again that 75 over 100 can be cancelled down, so we divided both top and bottom by 25 leaving us with an answer of one and three-quarters. So 175 percent is one and three-quarters.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s change a decimal percentage into a fraction. For instance we have the percentage 17.5 percent, which is 17.5 over 100. What we need to do here is to turn that 17.5 into a whole number so that we can then cancel the terms down. So we\u2019re multiplying 17.5 by 10 and doing that to the top we must do the same thing to the bottom. In other words 17.5 by 10 is 175, 100 times 10 is 1,000, now we look to see if anything cancels and of course it does, we can divide both top and bottom by 25 leaving us with an answer of seven over 40, so 17.5 percent is seven over 40 as a fraction.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a small decimal percentage. We have here 1.25 percent, which is the same as 1.25 divided by 100, again we need to turn the 1.25 into a whole number so this time we multiply it by 100 because 1.25 has got two decimal places and similarly we must multiply the denominator by 100 as well, so the top line becomes 125, the bottom line becomes 10,000, which cancels down into one over 80, so 1.25 percent is one over 80 as a fraction.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s change percentages into decimals. An example, 15 percent is the same as 15 over 100, change a percentage into a decimal we always move the decimal point two places to the left, so if you move the decimal point two places to the left we end up with 0.15. Similarly with a large percentage, 220 percent is the same as 220 divided by 100, so the quick way to do this is to move the decimal point two places to the left, so we end up with an answer of 2.2. So 220 percent is 2.2 as a decimal.\r\n\r\nFinally 7.9 percent is 7.9 divided by 100 and dividing by 100 you simply move the decimal point two places to the left, so moving it two places to the left leaves us with an answer of 0.079, so 7.9 percent is 0.079.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s change fractions into percentages. So here we\u2019re working in reverse to what we were doing in previous slides. Here\u2019s an example, seven over 10. To change a fraction into a percentage we always multiply it by 100 and because the fraction is written as seven over 10 we can write the 100 as a fraction as well, 100 over one. Notice that one zero on the top will cancel with one zero on the bottom, in other words I\u2019m dividing by 10, which leaves us with 70 over one, which gives us an answer of 70 percent. In other words seven-tenths is 70 percent as a percentage.\r\n\r\nHow about changing decimals into percentages, well we use the same idea as before. Here\u2019s an example, 0.55, to change that decimal into a percentage we multiply it by 100 and when you multiply by 100 what you\u2019re actually doing is you\u2019re moving the decimal point two places to the right, so we start at the decimal point, move two places and we finish after the last digit, the five in this case. So we have an answer of 55, which is 55 percent, so 0.55 is 55 percent as a percentage.\r\n\r\nWhat about small decimals, changing those into percentages. We use exactly the same rule as before. Here\u2019s an example, 0.09, to change that into a percentage we multiply by 100, so again, as before, we\u2019re moving the decimal point two places to the right and here the decimal point ends up on the far right hand side after the last digit, the nine, so our answer is nine percent, so 0.09 is nine percent as a percentage.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurds\r\nHow do you find a square root of any number that isn\u2019t already a square? The square root of 16 is 4 and the square root of 25 is 5 (because 4 x 4 is 16 and 5 x 5 is 25), and so on. But can you find the square root of a number between these \u2026for example \u221a20? Watch this video and see how to deal with this group of numbers called surds.\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on surds. A surd is a number that cannot be written as a fraction.\r\n\r\nFor instance numbers like root two and root seven have got a series of decimal places after the decimal point if you type those into the calculator so you can\u2019t write those as fractions. Numbers that are not surds are written below. You can see that two can be written as a fraction two over one, one point three can be written as 13 over 10 and root four, which is two, can be written as two over one. In other words they can all be expressed as fractions.\r\n\r\nThe trick in simplifying surds is to look for square factors. Here are a number of square factors, four, which is two squared, nine, which is three squared and so on up to 100, which is 10 squared. Look at this example, we have the square root of 200 and what we do is we express it so that there\u2019s a square factor under the square root sign which in this case is 100, shown in red, 100 times two under the square root sign is the same as the square root of 100 times the square root of two. Notice the square root of 100 is 10 so our answer is 10 root two. Notice also the square root sign is sometimes called the radical. Similarly three root 48, 48 is not a square factor but 16 times three is, which gives us three the square root of 16 times three, the root 16 is four and root three is left on its own, in other words we now have two whole numbers, three and four, which gives us 12 root three, so our answer is 12 root three.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to adding and subtracting surds one has to be mindful of the fact that only like surds can be added or subtracted. For instance, here\u2019s a question eight root five minus three root five. The root fives are the same in both terms, in other words we can subtract these two terms, eight root five minus three root five is five root five. However, if we have this question, where we have two root three plus five root seven minus 10 root three, notice there are two different surds here, a root three and a root seven, so we have to keep those separate in our answer, so that gives us five root seven minus eight root three.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the rule for multiplying surds and it\u2019s probably easier to illustrate this with an example. For instance root three times root two we can place both the root three and the root two under one square root sign, in other words that becomes the square root of three times two, three times two is six so the answer is root six.\r\n\r\nA second example, we have three root five times four root seven. Three and four are the whole numbers so you multiply those two separately, whereas the root five and the root seven can go under one square root sign, the square root of five times seven, so that gives us an answer of 12 root 35.\r\n\r\nFinally here\u2019s another one. We start with two root 10 times seven root six, which gives us initially 14 times the square root of 10 root six, which is root 60, but when you get a large square root sign in particular see if it will simplify into something a bit smaller, in other words look for a square factor which in this case is four, in other words root 60 is the square root of four times 15. Four times root 15, the square root of, gives us two times root 15, so we now have four times two which is 28 root 15.\r\n\r\nIn dividing surds we use a similar idea and again let\u2019s look at the example here, root 18 divided by root six is the same as the square root of 18 divided by six, which is three. In other words our answer is root three. Here\u2019s a number four divided by a surd, root two, so here we have four, which can be expressed as root 16 divided by root two. Notice I\u2019ve expressed both numerator and denominator as surds because we can now use the rule, which is the square root of 16 divided by two, which is root eight, and again notice that this simplifies because we can use a square factor here of four, so root four times two is two root two.\r\n\r\nRationalising a surd is a way of simplifying an expression where the surd is on the denominator. For instance if we have two over root five notice the surd is in the denominator here and to simplify that we can multiply two over root five by root five over root five, which is effectively one. In other words two over root five times root five over root five is two root five multiplying the top line, root five times root five is root 25 which is five. Notice the answer to root five over five has got no surd in the denominator.\r\n\r\nSimilarly here we have surds top and bottom but the purpose here is to try and get rid of the root two in the denominator, so we do as before by multiplying both top and bottom by root two over root two, which gives us root 10 on the top, root two times root two on the bottom is two times three which gives us six on the bottom. Again notice in both examples here that there are no surds in the denominator, that\u2019s rationalising surds.\r\n\r\nConjugate surds are just a slight extension of the rationalising surds problem we were doing in the previous slide. Here\u2019s an example; root three over five plus root two. What we do is we look at the denominator and then we write the conjugate of that, meaning we write the same terms five and root two but with a negative sign between them. In other words we\u2019re multiplying by five minus root two over five minus root two. Now we multiply out the problem, this gives us root three brackets five minus root two over five plus root two multiplied by five minus root two. If we multiply out the bottom line we\u2019ll get four terms, but notice in particular that when we multiply out this bottom line it\u2019ll be the surds that will cancel out. In other words we\u2019ll have no surd left in the denominator, so our answer is five root three minus root six divided by 23. Always make sure that the answer does not have a surd.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide.

A paraphrase is a restatement. It is the information or idea from a text in your own words.   To paraphrase, convey the original meaning but change the words and the sentence structure, and add a reference (i.e. the author name and the year of publication).  The aim of a paraphrase is to integrate the idea into a paragraph of your own writing. This is referred to as a citation.   It is common for paragraphs to contain more than one citation. If you want to cite an idea from another text in your paragraph, you need to ensure that you paraphrase and reference that idea separately. There are examples of this on the synthesising page of this tutorial.   To paraphrase:   start the sentence at a different point from the original (e.g. object to subject)  change words where appropriate: use synonyms  change the sentence structure (e.g. from\u202factive to passive voice)  separate ideas into shorter sentences or statements.    Avoiding plagiarism You can avoid plagiarism by paraphrasing correctly. Plagiarism is the direct copying of published work without acknowledging (citing) it. It appears that you take credit for the ideas of another author. In academia, this is considered academic misconduct or cheating. Learning how to paraphrase correctly will help to avoid penalties due to plagiarism. \u202f  Sometimes you will use direct quotes to emphasise a point or argument however, these should be used sparingly to demonstrate you have understood the content.    Changing the words To paraphrase a text, follow these steps.   Read the text you want to cite; locate the idea that is relevant for your purpose.   If you do not understand the idea,\u202fdo not\u202fattempt to paraphrase it. There is a risk that you will just copy it.   Circle the specialised words, i.e. the words that the text is actually about. These words or terms need to be included in your paraphrase.   Underline the words that can be changed.   Replace these words with words or phrases of similar meaning. Use a thesaurus or dictionary for synonyms, or the academic word lists for different word forms.   You now have a starting point to construct your paraphrase. Write the sentence in your own words when you are confident you understand it.   Changing the structure The other way to paraphrase is to change the structure of the original.    Read the text and make sure you understand the main idea. Do not copy \u202fit.  Start at a different point from the original. This means that you do not copy the text word for word. Write the idea from memory.  Write short sentences and change the order of the words.   Check what you have written against the original text to avoid accidental plagiarism. You should ensure that your version is different but that you have retained the original idea.

They act as signposts for the reader so they can follow the way the writer has organised their ideas. This page explains how to use linking words to improve the cohesion of your writing.\r\n\r\nDevelop cohesion\r\nIn the text below, notice how the writer uses linking words to develop the flow of their argument.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nLinking words\r\n\r\nDo teams in organisations need leaders?\r\nHow and why the leader was selected also appears to affect the leader\u2019s effectiveness. For example, Maxwell (2011) asserts that teams work better if they elect their own leader. However, Smith\u2019s research (2010) shows that team leaders are mainly selected on a hierarchical basis. Furthermore, in most cases when leaders were not elected democratically, team members reported a lack of confidence in their leaders\u2019 competence and knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow connections between the ideas\r\nLinking words enable the writer to show the connections between ideas. In the next example, notice how the use of linking words emphasises the writer\u2019s analysis of their research.\r\nExample\r\nLinking words\r\n\r\nOne factor within the team that seems to be important is the notion of team cohesiveness. Significantly, team cohesiveness enables a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals. Maxwell (2011, p.107) argues that highly cohesive teams \u2018have clear goals and successful outcomes\u2019. For example, cohesive teams are more likely to work well together, have enthusiasm for their work (Brown 2009) and so achieve a high rate of success (Zheng &amp; Hui 2008). Therefore, team cohesiveness has been shown to enhance team effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon linking words\r\nAll sentences in a paragraph need to relate to the main idea in the topic sentence. The reader should be able to see how each sentence flows from the previous one and how each is connected to the topic sentence.

First of all set out the decimals as shown. A couple of things to notice here. The first thing is that the 17 has been turned into a decimal, in other words, it\u2019s now 17.000. Why? Because the 21.479 decimal has got three numbers after the decimal point. They\u2019re called decimal places. So the 17 has three decimal places as well. Notice also the 3.04 has got an additional decimal place to make it three decimal places as well. So notice how the columns line up, each of the decimals has now got three decimal places.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to notice are the decimal points have been lined up in one column, and that\u2019s most important. So let\u2019s go ahead and do the addition. Starting with the right-hand column, zero plus zero plus nine is nine. The next column, four plus seven is 11, which is one and we carry the one shown in red and put it next to the four. The next column, zero plus zero plus four plus one is five. Now moving onto the other side of the decimal points, three plus seven plus one is 11, which is one and we carry the one as we did with the other one. In other words, we now have to add one plus two plus one which gives us four. So the answer to this decimal addition is 41.519.\r\n\r\nNow do some questions for yourself.

Thank you for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nSubtracting decimals\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on subtracting decimals.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with an example. 825.709 take away 272.456. Make sure at the outset that you line up the decimal points. Now let\u2019s carry out the subtraction. Nine take away six is three. The next column isn\u2019t so easy, we\u2019re saying zero take away five. In this case we have to add a one which effectively is a 10 to the top number. So we\u2019re now saying 10 take away five is five. Now we carry the one at the bottom number, in other words the bottom number is four plus one which is five. So the subtraction now is seven take away five which is two. Now moving over to the left hand side of the decimal point, five take away two is three. The next column is two take away seven, which as before with a zero we can\u2019t do, so what we do, we add the one or effectively the 10. So the 10 plus the two on the top becomes the number 12. So we\u2019re saying 12 take away seven which is five. As before make sure you carry the one on the bottom, so the number on the bottom now becomes two plus one which is three. So we say eight take away three is five. So the subtraction to this problem is 553.253.\r\n\r\nNow do some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nMultiplying decimals\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on multiplying decimals.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by multiplying decimals by 10, 100 and 1000. So let\u2019s start with the decimal 5.2 times 10. When we multiple by 10 notice that we have one zero, and when you multiply by 10 you simply move the decimal point one place to the right. In other words, 5.2 times 10 becomes 52.0, or just 52. In other words, the rule is move the decimal point one place to the right for each zero. Another one, 62.7 times 100. Notice two zeros, so we simply move the decimal point two places to the right, so this answer becomes 6270. Finally, let\u2019s move 3.14 times 1000. Here we move the decimal point three places to the right because we have three zeros, 1000 has got three zeros. So the answer is 3140.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a multiplication which does not involve multiplying by 10, 100 or 1000. We have 8.5 times four. It\u2019s set out as shown with the four underneath the five on the right hand side. Notice also that there is no decimal point in this multiplication. We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. So we start by multiplying the right hand columns, four times five is 20, zero under the four, carry the two, which I placed in red above the eight. Now I say four times eight is 32 and now I add the two to the 32 to give us 34. So we now have an answer with 340. Now we have to decide where to place the decimal point, and what you do now is to go up to the question again and count up how many numbers there are after the decimal point. Here we have one number, the five, which is after the decimal point. There are no numbers after the four. In other words we have one decimal place. So what we do is we move back from the right hand side one decimal place also. So the decimal point is now between the four and the zero. So our answer is 34.0.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a slight more complicated multiplication, 4.9 times 2.8. First of all set it out as shown. Note again there are no decimal points, 49 times 28. First of all we start on the right hand side by multiplying eight times nine which is 72, carry the seven, shown in red at the top. Multiply eight times four which is 32, add the seven and we get 39. So our first row is 392. Move onto the next row. Here we\u2019re multiplying by 2, so first of all we place a zero in the right hand column. Now we multiply two by nine which is 18, carry the one shown at the top. Two times four is eight plus one is nine. Now we have our second row 980. All we need to do now is add up the two rows. Two and zero is two, nine and eight is 17, carry one, nine and three is 12 plus one is 13. Finally we decide where to place the decimal point. Remember the rule, how many decimal places are there in the question. There are two, there\u2019s a nine and there\u2019s an eight, so there are two decimal places, which mean that we must move the decimal point back two places from the right hand side. In other words, the answer to this question is 13.72.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thank you for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nDividing decimals\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on dividing decimals.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by dividing decimals by 10, 100 and 1000. Here are some examples. Let\u2019s look at the first example, 53.7 divided by 10. Notice here that 10 has got one zero. So what we do when we divide by 10 is to move the decimal point one place to the left. In other words, the decimal point is now between the five and the three, giving us an answer of 5.37. Second example, 462.9 divided by 100. Here 100 has got two zeros, so we move the decimal point two places to the left. So the decimal point is now between the four and the six, giving us an answer of 4.629. Finally, 3782 divided by 1000. Notice here that 1000 has got three zeros, so we move the decimal point three places to the left, giving us a decimal point between three and seven, so the answer now is 3.782.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at some decimal divisions where we\u2019re not dividing by 10, 100 or 1000. Here\u2019s a fairly straight forward one, 8.4 divided by four. Setting it out as shown, four into 8.4, notice I\u2019ve lined up the decimal points to begin with. Four into eight goes two, and four into four goes one, giving us an answer of 2.1.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if we\u2019re not dividing by a whole number? Here\u2019s an example, 8.48 divided by 0.4. Notice 0.4 is not a whole number. What we do is to turn that 0.4 into a whole number and to do that we have to move the decimal point one place to the right. In other words, instead of the decimal point between zero and four, it\u2019s now after the four, or just four. But what we do to one decimal we have to do the other decimal, the 8.48 has to be changed as well. So moving the decimal point one place to the right give the new decimal 84.8. So we now have 84.8 divided by 4. So now we go ahead and carry out the division, four into 84.8. Four into eight goes two, four into four goes one. Notice the decimal points are lined up, and finally four into eight goes two, giving us an answer of 21.2.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s extend this decimal division to a slightly harder problem, 145.25 divided by 0.25. Again notice the problem. The problem is 0.25 is not a whole number. So we first of all have to turn that into a whole number. So what we do is move the decimal point two places to the right, giving us 25. Similarly, because we\u2019ve done that to the 0.25, we must move the decimal point two places to the right for our 145.25, giving us an answer of 14525. So what we\u2019re carrying out now is a division 14525 divided by 25. So let\u2019s go ahead and carry out that division 25 into 14525. 25 into one won\u2019t go, 25 into four won\u2019t go, 25 into 145 goes five times and that gives us a remainder of 20. So we place the 20 next to the two. So we\u2019re now dividing 25 into 202, which goes eight times and that gives us a remainder of two, which we place next to the five. So we\u2019re now saying 25 into 25 goes one exactly. So the answer to this question 145.25 divided by 0.25 is 581.\r\n\r\nNow do some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nConverting between fractions and decimals\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on converting between fractions and decimals.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by converting a decimal into a fraction. Here\u2019s the decimal 0.455. The first thing to notice about this decimal is that there are three digits after the decimal point. The first digit is the 10th, the second digit the 100th, and the third digit is the 1000th. It\u2019s the third digit you look at because the 1000th is the number that you place on the bottom of the fraction. In other word, what goes on the bottom of this fraction is 1000. What goes on the top is the decimal without the decimal point, in other words it\u2019s 455. So 0.455 as a fraction is 455 over 1000. Now you look to see if anything cancels top and bottom. And as you can see here, you can divide both top and bottom by five. Five into the top goes 91. Five into 1000 goes 200. So 0.455 as a fraction is 91 over 200.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a whole number decimal. Here\u2019s the decimal, 3.75. As before look at the digits, the first digit before the decimal point is a one. The digit after the decimal point is a 10th. The second digit is the 100th. Concentrate on that last digit, which is a 100th, in other words, the denominator of your fraction will be 100. The top of the fraction will be the decimal without the decimal point, in other words, 375. So 3.75 is 375 over 100. Now look to see if anything cancels and as you can see fives will divide into both top and bottom, 75 and 20. But also notice that 75 over 20 will cancel again, again five will divide into both top and bottom, giving us 15 over four. Turn that improper fraction into a mixed fraction, in other words, 15 over four is three and three quarters. So 3.75 as a decimal is three and three quarters as a fraction.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s convert a fraction into a decimal. Here\u2019s the fraction, two and three 8ths. The first thing we do is to convert this mixed fraction into an improper fraction, so two and three 8ths is 19 over eight. 19 over eight means 19 divided by eight, so when we turn it into a decimal we have to use the process as shown. Notice that the eight goes outside of the division and 19 goes inside. So now we carry out the division, eights into 19 goes two times. Notice here we have two times with a remainder of three. Now if there\u2019s a remainder then we have to place a decimal point and zeros after that decimal point. So carrying on, because we remainder three, we place the three next to the zeros, the number becomes 30. So we divide eight into 30, goes three times, three eights are 24, remainder six. Place the six next to the zero. The number is now 60. Eight into 60 goes seven, eight sevens are 56, remainder four. So the new number is 40. Eight into 40 goes five times exactly. Notice we keep going until we do not have a remainder. So our fraction two and three 8ths is 2.375 as a decimal.\r\n\r\nNow do some questions for yourself.

This is a short movie on simplifying fractions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by simplifying 27 divided by 36. The thing to notice about this fraction is that you can divide both top and bottom by nine, in other words, nine into 27 goes three and 36 divided by nine is 4. So we\u2019ve reduced a more complicated fraction to a much simpler one, three quarters.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s write this another way. 27 over 36 is divisible both top and bottom by nine. Nine into 27 goes three. Notice here we\u2019ve cancelled the 27, in other words, we\u2019re dividing by nine. And what we do to the top we do to the bottom, so we cancel the 36 and divide by nine, giving us four. Thus the answer is three quarters.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another example. We have to write 16 over five as a mixed number, or sometimes called a mixed fraction. 16 over five as you can see is a top heavy fraction, the number on the top is bigger than the number on the bottom. First of all what we need to do is divide the five into the 16, which gives us three and that gives us a remainder of one. And the remainder one is divided by the five, because the five is on the bottom of the fraction 16 over five. In other words, 16 over five is equal to three and one 5th.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s work in the reverse to what we were doing in the previous slide. Here we start with a mixed fraction or a mixed number and we need to turn it into an improper fraction. So we want to write two and four 7ths as an improper fraction. There\u2019s our two and four 7ths and what we do is this. We multiply the seven by the two to give us 14. Once we\u2019ve got the 14 we then add it to the four on the top of the fraction part of this number. So 14 plus four is 18. There\u2019s the arithmetic on the right hand side. Two times seven in brackets, which we do first, then we add the four. That gives us fourteen plus four over seven, which gives us 18 over seven. In other words, the mixed fraction two and four 7ths is 18 over seven as an improper fraction.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nAdding fractions\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on adding fractions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by adding two basic fractions, a quarter plus two quarters. Notice in this case that the number on the bottom called the denominator is the same. We call that the common denominator, in other words, the number they both have in common is four. Once the denominator is the same then we can just go ahead and start adding the top numbers, called the numerators, in other words, one plus two gives us three over four. So we leave the denominator alone and we add the numerators. So the answer is three quarters.\r\n\r\nBut what happens if the denominators are not the same? Well, we need to now find the common denominator of five and four, meaning what number does five and four divide into. That number is 20, so the common denominator is 20. And this is how we go about doing it. Five goes into 20 four times, so we multiple five by four in the left hand fraction. If we multiple the bottom by four, we must multiply the top of the fraction by four, so two times four is on the top. With our three quarters fraction, we\u2019re multiplying four by five to give us 20, therefore we multiply the top by five, three times five. In other words, we now have adding the eight and the 15 to give us the answer for our numerator, so eight plus 15 is 23, divided by 20 will give us one and three 20ths.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s add whole number fractions or mixed fraction. One and one 3rd, plus two and three 5ths. The first job is to separate out the whole numbers from the fractions. So we now have one plus two, and the fractions are one 3rd plus three 5ths. So the whole numbers must be added up and the fractions must be added up. So we now have three, and now we go ahead and find the common denominator of three and five, which is 15. So as with the previous slide, we say three times five is 15, one times five is five. The second fraction is five times three is 15, and therefore we multiply the top of the fraction by three, three times three. This gives us three plus five over 15, plus nine over 15. And five over 15 plus nine over 15 gives us 14 over 15. So our answer is three and 14 15ths.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nSubtracting fractions\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on subtracting fractions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with an easy fraction subtraction; two quarters minus one quarter. The thing to notice about this particular fraction subtraction is that the denominator for both fractions is in fact the same, which is four. If the denominator is the same then we can simply carry out the subtraction of the numerators for both fractions to take away one giving us an answer of one quarter, but just to reiterate in this particular case the fraction denominators are the same, so the subtraction for the numerators can be carried out straight away. However what if the two fractions have different denominators, in this case four and five are different denominators, so what we do first of all is look for a common denominator, that is the lowest number in which the four and the five will divide into, that number is 20, so we then carry out a little operation here. What I\u2019ve done is to multiply the four by the five and in the second fraction I\u2019ve multiplied the five by the four, so what I do to the bottom I must do to the top, so I\u2019ve multiplied the three by the five for the first fraction and I\u2019ve multiplied the two by the four for the second fraction. Now I have the same denominator on both, for both fractions, which is 20, because the denominator is the same I can then simply subtract the numerators, 15 minus eight.\r\n\r\nWhat about whole number fraction subtractions, in this case two and three-fifths take away one and one-third. What we do first of all is to subtract the whole numbers, in this case it\u2019s two take away one, then we go ahead and subtract the fractions, three\u2011fifths minus one-third. Here the common denominator is 15 and so with the first fraction, three over five, I\u2019m multiplying that by three to make me 15, therefore I multiply the top by three. The second fraction, one-third, I multiply the bottom by five to give us 15, therefore I multiply the top by five, this gives me one plus nine\u2011fifteenths minus five-fifteenths, which is an answer of one and four-fifteenths.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to the questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nMultiplying fractions\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on multiplying fractions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by looking at two simple fractions, two 3rds times four 5ths. Notice with this fraction problem that there are no terms top and bottom that cancel. In other words, what we do is to multiply out the top line and multiply out the bottom line, in other words, the numerator which is the top line is multiplied out, two times four, and the denominator, the bottom line, is multiplied out, three times five. Again stress the point here that there are no terms that cancel. So this gives us four times two is eight, three times five is 15. So our answer to this problem is eight 15ths.\r\n\r\nBut what happens if we have terms that do cancel? Here we have the problem five over eight times two over five. And you should notice that there are terms that cancel here. The first one which is the obvious one are the fives top and bottom. So we go ahead with our cancelling. Five into five goes one, five into five goes one. So we now have one times two over eight times one. But notice again we have cancelling of the two and the eight. Two into two goes once, and two into eights goes four. So we\u2019re cancelling more terms. That\u2019s about as far as we can go, so we multiply out the top line, one times one is one, the bottom line is four times one is four. So the answer to this problem is a quarter.\r\n\r\nHow about multiplying out mixed numbers? Here we have mixed numbers one and three quarters multiplied by two and two 3rds. When we multiply mixed numbers we first of all turn them into improper fractions. So one and three quarters is seven over four, two and two 3rds is eight over three. So now we look to see whether any of these terms cancel. And as you can see four goes into four once, four goes into eight twice. Nothing else cancels, so we then multiply out the top line, seven times two is 14, the bottom line, one times three is three. But notice we give our answer as a mixed number, not an improper fraction, so 14 over three is four and two 3rds.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nDividing fractions\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on dividing fractions.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by dividing two simple fractions, four 3rds divided by two 5ths. We start by changing the division sign to a multiplication sign and then we take the reciprocal of the two 5ths, the last term. In other words, we flip the two over five upside, which becomes five over two. We then carry out the operation multiplying four over three by five over two, and as you can see, the twos cancel, two into two goes one, two into four goes two. Nothing else cancels, so we multiply out top and bottom, 10 over three and leave our answer as a mixed fraction. So the answer to this question is three and one 3rd.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s divide two mixed fractions. Two and one quarter divided by one and one 5th. Before we actually carry out the division we must express our mixed fractions as improper fractions, so two and one quarter is nine over four divided by one and one 5th is six over five. Now we carry out our division by first of all changing the division sign to a multiplication sign and then taking the reciprocal of six over five, which becomes five over six. From there we look to see if anything cancels, and as you can see the nine and the six will divided by three, three into six goes two, three into nine goes three. Nothing else cancels, so we multiply out the top line, three times five is 15, the bottom line, four times two is eight. Thus an improper fraction which must be converted into a mixed fraction, which is one and seven 8ths. So the answer to this mixed fraction question is one and seven 8ths.\r\n\r\nOccasionally you may see questions like this where there is a fraction divided by a whole number, and before you carry out the division problem you must express the whole number as a fraction. In other words, three over four divided by six, which is six over one. So you express the whole number as six over one. Then we carry out the operation by changing the division sign to a multiplication sign and taking the reciprocal of six over one, which is one over six. Look again for terms that cancel, here three goes into three once, three goes into six twice. Nothing else cancels, multiply out the numerator, one, the denominator, four times two is eight. So our answer to this question is one over eight.\r\n\r\nNow carry out some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide.

[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on multiplying numbers.  Let\u2019s start by multiplying two numbers by one number, or two digits by one digit. Look at the left hand side, 52 times four. We start with the four and say four times two is eight, place the eight under the four. Then we say four times five is 20 and we place the 20 next to the eight. So 52 times four is 208. Not let\u2019s look on the right hand side example, 49 times 8. We start as before with the eight and we say eight times nine is 72, place the two under the eight and we carry the seven, shown in red. We then go from eight to four, eight times four is 32, and we add the seven to give us 39. So our answer is 392.  Now let\u2019s multiply two numbers by two numbers or two digits by two digits. 34 times 87. Start on the left hand side and say seven times four is 28, carry the two, shown in red at the top. Then we go from seven to three, seven times three is 21. Now we add the two shown in red to the 21, that gives us 23. So our first row is 238. Now we move to the next row, but before that we place a zero on the right hand side, shown in blue. Start our multiplication by multiplying eight by four, eight fours are 32, two carry three, shown in red at the top. Then we say eight times three is 24, plus three is 27. So our next row is 2720. We now add the two rows up, eight and zero is eight, three plus two is five, two plus seven is nine, and two. So our multiplication is equal to 2958.  Now let\u2019s multiply number by 10, 100 and 1000. Here\u2019s a number 52 times 10. And 52 times 10 gives us 520. The thing to notice about this multiplication is that because 10 has got one zero we simply add the one zero to the 52 to give us our answer, 520. So we\u2019re adding the zero. What about 52 times 100? The same idea applies, 100 has got two zeros, so we add the two zeros to the 52 to give us 5200. Finally, let\u2019s multiply 52 by 1000. 1000 has three zeros, so we add the three zeros to the right hand side, to give us 52000.  Now try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this movie. [\/lightweight-accordion] Dividing numbers  [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on dividing numbers.  Let\u2019s start by dividing 74,400 by 600. You set it out in the usual way, in other words we say 600 into 74,400. Notice with this question that 600 and 74,400 both have two zeros, so we can in fact cross off the two zeros in both numbers. This simplifies matters a lot, because now what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re dividing six into 744. So let\u2019s carry out the division. We start by saying six into seven goes once, shown in red, and that gives us one left over. So we place the one next to the four. So the new number becomes 14. So we now say six into 14 goes two, remainder two. The two goes next to the four, giving us a new number of 24. So we now say six into 24 goes four times. So the answer is 124.  Now let\u2019s divide 9,682 by 47. First of all we set it out in the usual way. We say 47 into 9,682. We now notice that there are no zeros in either number so we can\u2019t cross off zeros, so we go ahead with the division. So we say 47 into nine won\u2019t go, 47 into 96 goes two times, shown in red. So 47 times two is 94. We place the 94 under the 96 and subtract. That gives us two left over. We then bring the eight down as shown with the arrow alongside the two, giving us a number 28. So we now say 47 into 28 won\u2019t go, so we put the zero in red at the top, then we bring down the two shown with the red arrow. So we now have 282. So we divide 47 into 282, and that goes exactly six times. Six times 47 is 282. Do the subtraction, as long as you get zero left over, that\u2019s the end of the division. So the answer is 206 times.  Let\u2019s look at our final example, 12,065 divided by 19. Let\u2019s rewrite that as 19 into 12,065. So we now carry out the long division. Notice there are no zeros at the end so we have to carry on as normal. 19 into one won\u2019t go, 19 into 12 won\u2019t go, 19 into 120 will go six times. So we say six times 19 is 114. Do the subtraction, 120 take away 114 gives us six. Bring the six down shown with the red arrow, so the new number is now 66. So we now say 19 into 66 goes three times, shown in red. 19 times three is 57, write the 57 under the 66, subtract, that gives us nine left over.

These are the rules about which operation (+ - x or \u00f7) takes priority when you have more than one in a mathematical expression. Watch this video to see how to apply these rules.   [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on order of operations.  When we work through a maths problem we have to be aware of following a set of rules. These rules are called order of operations. The first thing to look out for are brackets and if a problem\u2019s got brackets in it, then what\u2019s inside those brackets must be done first. Secondly, if the problem has got multiplication and division, then they must be done next and we carry out the operation from left to right as we work through the problem. And finally, if there are adding and subtracting parts to the problem they must be done at the end, and again they must be done from left to right.  Let\u2019s do an example. Here\u2019s the question two plus seven minus six divided by two times three. Notice there are no brackets so we now move down to the second level, which is multiplication and division. Here we have six divided by two times three. So this part of the question must be done first, six divided by two is three, times three. Notice we\u2019re moving from left to right, and finally we multiply three by three which gives us nine. So we end up with two plus seven minus nine. Now we have just adding and subtracting to do, which is the last operations. Moving from left to right, two plus seven is nine, then we take away nine and finally we have our answer, zero. So the answer to this question is zero.   Let\u2019s look at this problem. 16 divided by eight plus four times brackets seven minus three close brackets. Notice here we have brackets, so that\u2019s the first operation that we carry out. So seven take away three is worked out to give us four. Now we have 16 divided by eight plus four times four. The division and multiplication must be carried out next, and we move from left to right, 16 divided by eight is two plus four times four is 16. So we have an answer of 18.  Now do some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie. [\/lightweight-accordion] Negative numbers: addition and subraction How do you minus a negative? Ideas about profit \/ loss and many STEM areas need an understanding of adding and subtracting positive and negative numbers. Watch this video to get the concepts.   [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on adding and subtracting negative numbers.  Let\u2019s start by adding negative numbers. Here\u2019s the example. Plus two minus four, I place the number line at the bottom of the screen, zero at the centre, numbers to the right are positive; numbers to the left are negative. So let\u2019s start with a plus two, plus two means moving two units to the right on the number line from zero, so now we\u2019re at positive two. Now we have to take away four, so starting at the two we move back four places because it\u2019s negative. Notice the answer here will be from where we started to where we finished, in other words from zero to negative two. In other words plus two, take away four, is equal to minus two.  Let\u2019s do another one. Minus three plus six, notice I\u2019m starting with a negative here, so by going negative I\u2019m moving to the left from the number line, from zero, so I\u2019m now at negative three. Now I have to plus six, being a plus I have to move to the right six units, so starting at negative three, moving six places to the right we end up at positive three. So again the answer is from where we started, which is a zero, to where we finished, which in this place is positive three, so our answer is positive three. So negative three plus six is positive three.  Now let\u2019s add two negative numbers. Negative one, negative two, so because they\u2019re all negative I\u2019m moving to the left on the number line, negative one and then negative two and the answer is from where we start to where we finish, which will be negative three, so negative one negative two is equal to negative three.  Let\u2019s look at another one. Here we\u2019re starting with plus one minus negative four. Notice again that the two negatives are next to each other so when they\u2019re next to each other we add, so this problem becomes positive one plus four, which is quite a simple operation to do on the number line, plus one is moving one place to the right, adding four will be adding four more, giving us an answer of five. In other words, positive one minus negative four is positive five.  Now try some questions for yourselves. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thank you for watching this short movie. [\/lightweight-accordion] Negative numbers: multiplication and division How do you multiply and divide negative numbers? There are rules when multiplying and dividing negative numbers. The numbers work the same way but the sign may change. Watch this video to understand how.   [lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"] Hi, I\u2019m Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on multiplying and dividing positive and negative numbers.  Let\u2019s multiply positive and negative numbers first. At the table red pluses and minuses are what we start with, the blue pluses and minuses are the answers. So for instance if I multiply a plus by a plus I trace down from the plus in the top row and I trace across from the plus in the left hand column. Where they intersect is my answer, in other words, a plus times a plus is a plus shown in blue. Similarly do the same thing with the negative signs, the negative in the top row, trace it down, the negative in the left hand column trace it across, where they intersect is the answer and as you can see the answer is a plus. In other words if the signs are the same the answer is positive.  Now let\u2019s look at the other signs. Let\u2019s multiply a plus by a minus. So we trace down from the plus in the top and we trace across from the minus in the left hand column, where they intersect is our answer in blue and as you can see they intersect at the negative sign. Similarly if I multiply a minus by a plus a minus in the top row by a plus in the left hand column, trace the minus down from the top and the plus sign from the left across until they intersect, where they intersect is the answer and as you notice it\u2019ll be a negative sign again. In other words when the signs are different, in other words plus and minus, the answer is negative.  So let\u2019s look at this in more detail. Let\u2019s go through each one step by step. The first one is positive by positive is equal to a positive. Plus times plus equals plus. Here\u2019s an example; plus four times plus four, plus times plus gives us a positive answer, four times seven is 28, in other words the answer is plus 28. So let\u2019s look at this in more detail. Let\u2019s go through each one step by step, the first one is positive by positive is equal to a positive, plus times plus. Now let\u2019s look at negative times negative, minus times a minus is a plus. [Unclear] minus five times minus nine, two negatives gives us a positive answer, notice if the signs are the same the answer is always positive, so minus times a minus is a plus, five times nine is 45, so our answer is plus 45.  Now we have negative times a positive is a negative, minus times a plus is a minus, notice the signs are different the answer is always negative, so with an example, minus six times plus 11, the signs are different so the answer is negative, six times 11 is 66 so the answer is minus 66.  Finally positive times a negative is a negative. Plus times a minus is a minus. The signs are different therefore the answer is always negative. Example, plus 12 times minus seven, the signs are different so the answer is negative, 12 sevens are 84 so the answer is negative 84.  Now let\u2019s divide positive and negative numbers. Look at the table, and look again at the similarity between this table and the table we had for multiplication. For instance if the signs are the same the answer is positive, if the signs are different the answer is negative. In other words the rules that we use for division are exactly the same as the rules that we use for multiplication.  So let\u2019s look at them one by one. Plus divided by a plus is a plus, 36 divided by nine is the same as positive 36 divided by positive nine which would give us an answer of positive four. Negative divided by a negative is a positive, minus divided by a minus is a plus, notice if the signs are the same the answer is always positive. So for instance minus 56 divided by minus eight, the signs are the same, the answer must be positive, 56 divided by eight is seven so our answer is plus seven.  Now let\u2019s look at negative divided by positive, the answer is negative because if the signs are different the answer is always negative. For instance minus 78 divided by plus three, minus divided by a plus is a negative, 78 divided by three is 26, so the answer is negative 26. Finally positive divided by a negative is a negative, plus divided by minus is a minus. Example, plus 96 divided by minus six, the signs are different, therefore the answer must be negative, 96 divided by negative six is 16, so the answer is negative 16.  Now do some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.

Why are there letters in the equation? This page links to resources that will help you answer these questions.\r\nAlgebraic expressions involve pronumerals (letters) to represent values. Pronumerals can take many different values. We often need to plug our own values into a given formula for calculating our finances, and this is called substitution.\r\nThere are rules around adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with pronumerals. Review these pages and videos to see how it works.\r\n\r\n \tA1.1 Algebraic operations\r\nIntroducing the basic skills for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (+ - \u00d7 \u00f7) of algebraic expressions. Courses in science, engineering and other fields require you to have these skills.\r\n \tA1.2 Algebraic substitution\r\nFind out how to replace pronumerals with numbers in a formula to get a numerical value for some quantity. In many courses you will be required to use formulae to calculate something of interest. The process of substituting numbers for pro-numerals in an expression or formula is called substitution.\r\n \tA1.3 Removing brackets\r\nWhat do I do with the brackets? Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets.\r\n \tA1.4 Algebraic fractions \u2013 Addition and subtraction\r\nHow do I deal with fractions involving pronumerals? Adding and subtracting fractions always requires a common denominator (which is the lower half of the fraction). These need to be the same before you can add or subtract. This means converting some of the fractions to forms that are consistent in the denominators. It is possible to do this even when the fractions include pronumerals.\r\n \tA1.5 Algebraic fractions \u2013 Multiplication and division\r\nWhat is an algebraic fraction? The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n \tA1.6 Quadratics\r\nLet's take a look at algebraic fractions where the denominator is a quadratic expression. Such fractions are common in mathematics and engineering.\r\n \tA1.7 Partial fractions\r\nFind out how to express an algebraic fraction as a sum of simpler algebraic fractions (partial fractions). The method of partial fractions involves breaking up an algebraic fraction into simpler parts that are added together. This is useful in integration and in finding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms.\r\n \tA2.1 Rearranging formulae\r\nRearranging formulas, also called transposition of formulas, is a necessary skill for most courses. Let's work on some essential skills in manipulating formulas.\r\n \tA2.2 Rearranging formulas \u2013 Brackets and fractions\r\nLearn how to manipulate or rearrange formulas that involve fractions and brackets.\r\n \tA2.3 Transposition of formulas with challenges\r\nAre you still trying to get that variable on its own from the formula, but it is in a tricky place \u2013 or maybe it appears more than once? Here we demonstrate manipulating or rearranging complex formulas, with overviews and practice questions.\r\n \tA3.1 Common factors\r\nA common factor is a number or pronumeral that is common to terms in an algebraic expression. Removing the common factors allows us to factorise algebraic expressions and write them in a simpler form. Factorisation using common factors is a basic skill in mathematics so we'll discuss that too.\r\n \tA3.2 Perfect squares\r\nA perfect square is something like \\(5^{2}, x^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\). In this module we deal with perfect squares of the form: \\(\\left(x\\pm y\\right)^{2} =x^{2}\\pm2xy+y^{2}.\\)These forms are very common in mathematics and help us simplify expressions. They are important to know if you are an engineering or science student.\r\n \tA3.3 Difference of two squares\r\nIntroducing the difference of two squares formula which allows us to factorise expressions like \\(a^2 - b^2\\) or \\(x^2-36\\).\r\n \tA3.4 Quadratics\r\nQuadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\). Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. Find out how to factorise a quadratic into two linear factors. For example \\[x^2+5x+6 = \\left(x+2\\right)\\left(x+3\\right).\\]\r\n \tA3.5 Completing the square\r\nQuadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\). Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. We explain how to factorise a quadratic into two linear factors using the completing the square method. This is a general method that allows any quadratic to be factorised. For example \\[x^2+8x-5 = \\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right).\\]\r\n \tA3.6 Polynomial long division\r\nYou may have learnt long division in school. It enables you to divide two numbers that may be quite large. It is also possible to use long division on polynomials so that they can be factorised. Cubic polynomials are the most common. Find out how to write \\[x^3-5x^2-2x+24=\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right).\\] This type of factorisation is useful for graphing the cubic polynomial.\r\n\r\nExplore these skills in a real world context\r\n[nav-panel title='Evaluating market information' link='https:\/\/rmit.pressbooks.pub\/llcc\/chapter\/job-board-ad-aerospace-engineer-spacecraft\/' icon='https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/design-system\/images\/icon-llcc-large.svg']Job Board Ad: Aerospace Engineer Spacecraft[\/nav-panel]","excerpt":"What is algebra? Why are there letters in the equation? This page links to resources that will help you answer these questions. Algebraic expressions involve pronumerals (letters) to represent values.

This module shows the three different ways in which you can find a single number to summarise a set of data.\r\n \tS4 Measures of spread\r\nThe range, the interquartile range and the standard deviation are three different measures of the spread of a set of data. This module shows three different ways to calculate a number to represent the spread of a set of data.\r\n \tS5 Probability rules\r\nThis module covers the rules of basic probability, including the multiplication and addition principles and complementary events.\r\n \tS6 Sample spaces\r\nA sample space is a list of all the possible outcomes. There are a number of techniques that can be used to list the sample space.\r\n \tS7 Conditional probability\r\nIf two events are not independent then the outcome of one event can change the probability of the second event occurring.\r\n \tS8 Binomial probability\r\nThe binomial distribution is a discrete distribution consisting of repeated trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes.\r\n \tS9 Normal distribution\r\nThe normal distribution is a \u201cbell-shaped\u201d, symmetrical, continuous probability distribution.\r\n \tS10 Standard normal distribution\r\nA normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one is called the standard normal distribution. Areas under the standard normal distribution curve represent probabilities which can be found via a calculator or a \u201cz-table\u201d.\r\n \tS11 Probability and the normal distribution\r\nIn any normal distribution the mean and standard deviation can be used to convert it to a standard normal distribution and when can then compute probabilities.\r\n \tS12 Sampling distributions\r\nLearn how we can sample distributions. The distribution of the means of all the possible samples of a certain size tend to follow a normal distribution.\r\n \tS13 Confidence intervals\r\nWe can use the mean of a sample to estimate the mean of the entire population.

This will form the basis of your summary which will be in the form of a coherent 50\u2013100-word paragraph or just two or three sentences.\r\nResources on Summarising provides tips, examples, and activities that will help develop your summarising skills.\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Example\"]\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe article explores the factors that facilitate or hinder employees\u2019 adjustment when moving from a conventional office-based environment to a virtual work environment, whether situated distantly or at home. The article suggests that structural factors (such as work independence and clear evaluation criteria) and relational factors (such as feeling of trust in colleagues and management, and a sense of connectedness to the company) are key facilitators of successful adjustment. The researchers also explore aspects such as age, gender and experience of virtual work, as moderators of the key indicators.\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\nWhat to include in a critical analysis\r\nIf your assignment guide requires a critical analysis for annotated bibliography, you will need to focus on the value of the material and sources you are looking into. Consider asking yourself:\r\n\r\n \tWhat are the strengths and limitations of the source in terms of aim, methodology, and findings?\r\n \tAre the findings sound, logical and well researched?\r\n \tIs the source original, important and of a high standard?\r\n \tHow does this source add to the research in the field?\r\n \tWhere is its place \u2014 and relationship \u2014 in the wider field of research and scholarly discussions?\r\n\r\nTutorials on Developing a critical approach and Critical reading can help you develop your critical analysis skills.\r\nCritical analysis\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Example\"]The article provides a useful rationale explaining the basis of the study design. The results are supported statistically, and graphic representations distil the important findings. While the research sample is large, however, and a representative cross-section of employees across genders, job categories and management hierarchy is used, it may be biased in the fact that the selection is limited to employees in the telecommunication industries. Furthermore, while all results correlate to measures of the employees\u2019 adjustment to virtual work, the findings rest largely upon \u2018self-perceived adjustment\u2019. Whether or not this is a reliable and accurate measure of successful adjustment is not addressed.[\/ll-accordion]\r\nWhat to include in a reflection\r\nWriting a reflection for your annotated bibliography includes writing a few sentences explaining why or why not the source is useful or helpful for your research or how it relates to the overall theme of your research.\r\nWhile reflective writing is stating your personal ideas and evaluations, it should still be objective and unemotional. Tutorials on Writing an academic reflection can help you practice writing better reflections for annotated bibliographies.\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Example\"]\r\nReflection\r\nThe finding that organisational connectedness is a powerful factor in the adjustment to virtual work for men has informed the present research on women in IT. The article is useful to my research topic as Raghuram et al. find that although a correlation between feeling connected to the company and successful virtual work adjustment still remains, it is much less significant for females. This potentially supports the notion that women are well suited to being the pioneers of the virtual work environment.[\/ll-accordion]","excerpt":"An annotated bibliography is a list of the information sources you have selected for your research topic (e.g. journal articles or book chapters) accompanied by comments (annotations) of how each item contributes to your research. It is presented in the format of a bibliography or reference list.

Let's find out how to make a strong start.\r\nStarting a group project is the same as starting an individual project. You will need to:\r\n\r\n \tanalyse the task\r\n \tdetermine what needs to be done\r\n \tcreate a plan for completing the task.\r\n\r\nIt is important to establish good working relationships at the beginning, with protocols and agreements for communication, behaviour and responsibilities. Good communication is especially important for online groups.\r\nStrategy 1: Analyse the task as a group\r\n\r\n \tAgree on what the task is asking you to do. Review the task instructions, marking criteria\/rubric and any other information you have.\r\n \tIdentify if the task has to be completed in a particular order (e.g. parts 3 or 4 rely on work done for parts 1 and 2). This determines how you might plan your timeline and delegate responsibilities for completing the assignment. If your group has any questions about the task, contact your lecturer as soon as possible. Check out Starting my first assignment and for more advice on planning.\r\n\r\nStrategy 2: Create a timeline\r\n\r\n \tAssess the time required for a group assignment. Groups often underestimate how long an assignment may take. A timeline identifies key milestones and helps you manage the workload to meet deadlines. Be realistic and be prepared to adapt your timeline as you progress. Members of online groups may be working in different time zones. Factor this into your timeline.\r\n \tInclude enough time for research. Your research will be a large part of the task. You may also need to allow time for additional research during the drafting\/production stage of the task.\r\n \tAllow time for drafting and producing the final product. Editing and proofreading is an important final stage of any task. Allow time for the group to review the overall product for accuracy and consistency to ensure you are presenting your best efforts. The example below shows a group's schedule over six weeks. Some group work tasks may last a whole semester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nTask management\r\nPeople management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a01\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAnalyse task\r\n \tShare understanding\r\n \tDivide assignment into tasks\r\n \tAllocate roles\/responsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tForm group - share contact details\r\n \tAgree on group protocols\r\n \tRecord meeting decisions and create agenda for next meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a02\r\n\r\n\r\n \tCommence research\r\n \tShare research data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGroup meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a03\r\n\r\n\r\n \tReview progress against timeline\r\n \tReview task completion\r\n \tReport on findings\r\n \tCollate information\r\n \tReallocate tasks if required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGroup meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a04\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGroup meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a05\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGroup meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek\u00a06\r\n\r\n\r\n \tFinal edit and proof\r\n \tSubmit on time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGroup meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the assignment planner to create a draft schedule.\r\n\r\nStrategy 3: Schedule regular meetings\r\n\r\n \tUse meetings to help manage the group and manage the work.\r\n\r\nImage by OpenClipart-Vectors via Pixabay, licensed under\u00a0CC0.","excerpt":"Good planning lays the groundwork for successfully completing group task.

Always start with genuine, positive feedback: say what you appreciate about their work before offering critical feedback.\r\nBe sensitive to how others may respond to criticism. Be nice.\r\n\r\nUse the S.M.A.R.T. principles to focus your feedback on the task:\r\n\r\nSpecific: Focus on actual examples of the work or performance. General or vague statements are unhelpful.\r\n\r\nMotivating: Give reasons to continue or change behaviour. Why is it important or useful?\r\n\r\nAction-oriented: Align actions with the task requirements. If a change is required, what needs to happen?\r\n\r\nRealistic: Is the change something that the person can do? Do they need help? Who is going to help them?\r\n\r\nTimely: Provide feedback when it is requested or required.

Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude (size) and direction. This branch of maths is fundamental to physics and engineering to represent physical quantities that have a direction.\r\nThe University of Colorado has some useful vector simulations, so come back and have a look at those once you've gone through these worksheets.\r\n\r\n \tV1 Introduction to vectors\r\nIntroducing the basic concept of vectors (which are measurable quantities with direction such as force) and the concept of a scalar (which is a quantity without a direction such as heat or thermal energy).\r\nWe cover vector components (aligned along the horizontal and vertical or the 3-dimensional axes), unit vectors (a vector of size = 1), vector magnitude (or size) and how to add and subtract vectors.\r\n \tV2 Resolution of vectors\r\nVector quantities in combination will enhance or counteract each other, depending on their direction. An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.\r\nThis task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics.\r\n \tV3 Scalar product\r\nWhat is a scalar product? What is a dot product? This is the result of multiplying the magnitudes of the components of two or more vectors. The result is not a vector, but a scalar (which is without direction).\r\n \tV4 Vector product\r\nWhat is a vector product? What is a cross product? The vector product is a vector that is the result of multiplying the magnitudes (size) of two vectors. The magnitude is found using matrices and determinants).\r\nThe result of the cross product is another vector, and the direction is perpendicular (normal, at 90 degrees) to the plane of both the original vectors.\r\n \tV5 Projection of vectors\r\nIn \u2019Resolution of vectors\u2019 we learned how to resolve vectors in two dimensions along horizontal and vertical axes. It is also possible to resolve one vector along the line of another vector (instead of along the x-y axes).\r\nLearn how to find the projection (resolution) of one vector in the direction of a second vector.\r\n \tV6 Vector equation of a line\r\nIf you want to uniquely define a line, you need to pin it between two points in 3-dimensional space. You can also define a point with a 3-dimensional vector through it. This process uses three types of equations.\r\nLearn how to find the vector equation, the parametric equation, and the symmetric equation of a line in three-dimensional space.\r\n \tV7 Intersecting lines in 3D\r\nLearn how to determine if two lines in three dimensions intersect (cross each other) and, if so, what their point of intersection is.\r\n \tV8 Equation of a plane\r\nLearn how to find the equation of a plane (a 2-dimensional space)\r\na) through three points or\r\nb) given a normal (line at right angles) and a point on the plane or\r\nc) given a parallel plane and a point on the plane.\r\n \tV9 Intersecting planes\r\nTwo 2-dimensional planes will slice through each other (unless they are parallel). Where they slice will be defined by a straight line. There will also be an angle between the two planes.\r\nLearn how to determine the angle between two intersecting planes and the equation of the line of intersection.\r\n \tV10 Distance from a point to a plane\r\nThe shortest distance from any point in the air to the ground is defined by a line sitting at right angles to the ground going straight down.\r\nLearn how to find the perpendicular (right angle) distance from a point to a plane.\r\n \tV11 Directional derivatives\r\nIf you are on the side of a hill, the gradient depends on the direction you look. So the directional derivative is the gradient in a particular direction.\r\nLearn how to find the directional derivative of a function of two variables f(x,y) or three variables g(x,y,z) at a point and in a given direction. This is very useful in engineering and especially computer graphics.\r\n\r\n[nav-panel title=\"Job Board Ad: Aerospace Engineer Spacecraft\" link=\"https:\/\/rmit.pressbooks.pub\/llcc\/chapter\/job-board-ad-aerospace-engineer-spacecraft\/\" icon=\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/design-system\/images\/icon-llcc-large.svg\"]Explore these skills in a real world context[\/nav-panel]","excerpt":"2 + 2 does not always equal 4 when the problem is translated into a 2 or 3 dimensional space.

Watch this video to find out more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nGraphs, sometimes known as gryphs, usually have points or markers on them. The location of this point is given by an ordered pair. For instance ordered pairs are used to locate points on a street map. For street maps, however, it is common to use a letter and a number, say B17 or D5. An ordered pair on a graph is a pair of numbers in a certain order written in brackets and separated by a comma. For example, six comma four is an ordered pair. When an ordered pair is used to locate a point on a grid the two numbers are called the co-ordinates of the point. The point at the centre of the graph is called the origin. The co-ordinates of this point are zero comma zero, this is the point at which the horizontal X axis intersects the vertical Y axis.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at point A, to find the X co-ordinate we start at the origin and move four units horizontally to the right. To find the Y co-ordinate we move vertically up two units, the co-ordinates of A are therefore four comma two. Note that the order of the numbers is very important, for instance four comma two is a very different point on a graph to the ordered pair two comma four.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at point B. To find the X co-ordinate we move from the origin two units to the left which means it\u2019s a negative X value, ie, negative two. To find the Y co-ordinate we move above the origin four units which means it\u2019s a positive Y value, ie, four or positive four. Hence the co-ordinates of B are negative two comma four.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at point C. To find the X co-ordinate we move from the origin six units to the left, which means it\u2019s a negative X value, ie, negative six. To find the Y co-ordinate we move below the origin four units, which means it\u2019s a negative Y value, ie, negative four. Hence the co-ordinates of C are negative six comma negative four.\r\n\r\nFinally let\u2019s look at point D. To find the X co-ordinate we move from the origin three units to the right which means it\u2019s a positive X value, ie, three. Notice that this point is midway between two and four on the X axis. To find the Y co-ordinate we move below the origin three units, which means it\u2019s a negative Y value, ie, negative three. Again we have taken the point midway between two and four. Hence the co-ordinates of D are three comma negative three.\r\n\r\nThat finishes the lessons on graphs. Now open the graphs worksheet and work through the exercises.

On this page, you will find tips to help you manage your reading load by reading both efficiently and effectively.\r\n\r\nReading efficiently: surveying, skimming and scanning\r\nStudents can be easily overwhelmed by the amount of reading they are required to do at university. This short video gives you an overview of what makes an\u00a0efficient reader and shows you how to become one yourself.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tzptle0ilYA\"][transcript]In some of your courses, you may find that you are faced with long lists of required readings. The truth is, you are not required to read every book, every journal article, or every research paper word-for-word. Instead, you need to learn how to survey, skim, and scan texts. This will allow you to get the most out of texts, whilst saving you a lot of time in the long run.\r\n\r\nSo, how do I survey a text? Surveying texts is straight-forward; in fact, you're probably already using this reading technique without realising. To survey a text, you read the title, the cover blurb, the contents page, and the index. Then, you quickly look over the chapter headings.\r\n\r\nHow do I skim? When you're skimming a text, you're looking for just the main ideas.\r\n\r\nHow do I scan? When scanning, you're looking for the important keywords in a text, you are quickly looking for the detail.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the example.\r\n\r\n[Topic sentence] The functions of a team leader may often vary. [End topic sentence] [Linking word] Depending [end linking word] on the nature of the [Keyword] team, [End keyword] the [Keyword] leader [End keyword]\u00a0 may function predominantly in [Keyword] many diverse roles, [End keyword] [Linking word] such as [End linking word] an overseer, a resource person, a setter of benchmarks for best practice by the [Keyword] team, [End keyword] a [Keyword] team [End keyword] builder, or take on all of these [Keyword] roles [End keyword] and others (Addison, 1996). [Linking word] Since [End linking word] the [Keyword] team leader [End keyword] will have [Keyword] varying [End keyword] skills in these [Keyword] roles, [End keyword] it is likely that they may not perform each task equally well. [Linking word] Therefore, [End linking word] it is reasonable to argue that the [Keyword] role [End keyword] of the [Keyword] team [End keyword] leader is not always necessarily an asset.\r\n\r\nSo, what next? So you've surveyed, skimmed, and scanned everything like you were supposed to. Now what? Often this is enough to get the main idea of a text, but sometimes you will need to read the text in detail. However, since you now know what the key ideas and keywords are, and you have a general idea of where to find this information, you'll find it easier to read only the stuff that's relevant.\r\n\r\nSo, let's recap:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When we survey, we read the title, cover blurb, contents page, index, and chapter headings of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When we skim, we just look for the main ideas of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;And, when we scan, we look for the keywords of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nSurveying\r\nSurveying is a pre-reading technique that allows you to get a general idea of the contents of a book, article or other type of text.\r\n\r\nOnce you have surveyed, you can often decide whether to then read the text in detail, or if it doesn't have the information you need, move on to the next text.\r\n\r\nFor books and articles, you start by looking at:\r\n\r\n \tblurbs, abstracts and summaries\r\n \tintroduction and conclusion paragraphs\r\n \theadings and sub headings\r\n \tany images, graphs or charts and their captions\r\n \tchapter outlines or key points, if they have been provided\r\n\r\nWith your surveying done, you can then move on to skimming and scanning.","excerpt":"Throughout your time at university, you will be required to read and engage with many articles, books and other information sources.

The resource will introduce four areas that international students often find new and a little difficult at first.\r\nExpectations\r\nSelf-directed learning is an important feature of the Australian university system. Learn how to become a proactive and independent learner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany new students are surprised that they are expected to become self-directed and independent learners in Australian tertiary institutions. You will need to develop the following skills:\r\n\r\n \tThe capacity to learn without explicit direction, for example using the library to find readings, and organising and completing your assignments.\r\n \tThe ability to work independently and manage your time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsking questions\r\nSome students feel uncomfortable about asking questions, perhaps because, they think they will be seen as rude, too demanding or wasting time. In Australia, staff would prefer you ask. If you don't understand something you are expected to ask questions.\r\n\r\nWho to ask\r\nAt RMIT there are people whose job is to help you and answer your questions. These people include:\r\n\r\n \tteaching staff\r\n \tlibrarians\r\n \tadministrative staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents can get support from staff in areas such as International Student Support, RMIT Connect and\u00a0the Library's study support. These people are very keen to answer your questions and to help you.\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Were your experiences at RMIT different to your expectations?\"\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Videos\"]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/J7d4D0uYSTY\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nYes from what I thought was expected of me they were quite different, academically. I suppose that's what you mean.\r\n\r\nThey were to a greater extent from what I am used to, and from what I did in my undergraduate study.\r\n\r\nI would have my lecturer in front of me teaching, and from the lecture I would just get most of the things. Whatever other reading would be mostly additional reading.\r\n\r\nWhereas what I've found with RMIT is that I basically have to do most of the reading myself. It's more like directing that they do, and then also you do most of the learning all by yourself, even just with an assignment, and then also, they use a lot more different techniques, I suppose, or styles of teaching.\r\n\r\nIt's not just the classroom situation, you do presentations, there's online stuff, it's very interesting. It's quite interesting and diverse.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the online learning stuff, some of the teaching that they do - it would be like a learning blog, some kind of a chat room, and you exchange information with your classmates, and your lecturer, and they respond to that, and you do some research.\r\n\r\nYou may do research on a topic, and you get some articles, and you come and discuss what you found on the topic, and your thoughts, and you give the links, and they, the classmates or your peers, give input, and add info to it, and then your lecturer will look at all that, and it will be graded. And that was very new to me.. very very new, especially because, I wasn't used to using computers so much. I was just used to the good old writing down an assignment, and submitting it.\r\n\r\nOnce you get past the phobia, because it can seem a little intimidating, but then you realise that well, it's either you swim or sink. If you embrace it and you face it, it's not rocket science at all, and it's quite easy to use, and it's very user friendly, and especially because there's also always lots of help and support.\r\n\r\nI think it helps to speak up. My mum used to say that if you ask you will only be a fool once, but if you don't ask, you'll be a fool forever, so it's better to just ask, even if you think it's probably a stupid question.\r\n\r\nJust ask and then you will learn a lot from peers. You will learn a lot from your lecturers too. You will learn a lot from everyone. There's plenty of help if you are willing, and you must have enough courage to ask once. Usually the next time it's a whole lot easier, and in the process you actually help others, whilst you are getting helped.\r\n\r\nYou find that there's a whole lot of other people that need the same help, and you become a community, and you work a lot more better as a team.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mBiGF3Y8fYc\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nI think I would advise them to ask a lot of questions from everybody around them, especially their teachers, which are a major resource.\r\n\r\nI think that they should make an effort and try to find and locate the kind of students services, international student services that are available at RMIT. They are a big resource to help.\r\n\r\nI was really really amazed at the kind of services that were provided to international students. We don't have that.. those kind of student support services in our country, and later on I used those services as well.\r\n\r\nI would advise them to make an effort to go and meet these people, and explore what kinds of support they can get. If they can't get some kind of concrete support, I am sure they can lend you an ear, and they can definitely guide you towards some services which can find some solutions for you. And the second thing that I found which is very different over here, was the kind of learning environment in the classroom. It's less formal and it's less ... like somebody standing there in front of you and teaching you or lecturing you. It's more interactive, but for lots of international students it's a problem for them.\r\n\r\nAnd what happens is because they're in the habit of not participating in the class, they end up staying quieter in the class which is usually mistaken by being not very knowledgeable by the lecturers.\r\n\r\nSo I think they should make an effort to participate in the class more, and let their opinions be known about anything, and they don't have to worry that they would offend the teacher or their class fellows. They have the right to their opinions, and I think that they can express that.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/d1D18QEIqro\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nIn my previous study, I used to have examination with the questions, and those questions will ask you about the knowledge you have learned during your course.\r\n\r\nSo it's just like you try to write down what the teacher has said in the classroom, what were written in your textbook, but here, the assignments here require you to explore the field of knowledge by yourself, and so you've got to find out information by yourself, under the guidance of your lecturer.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/s-aMSpwFOgI\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThe semester is fairly short comprised into 13-15 weeks, and there's a lot of hard work going on all through those 15 weeks, whereas what I'm used to from Denmark is that we have a semester and then we have quite a long break preparing for an exam.\r\n\r\nIf you do the work from the beginning, on from day one, then everything is going to be fine at the end, but it is quite important that you aren't too lazy in the beginning. So what I've experienced is that if I start out hard from the day one, and kind of get an idea about how much work has to be done, and when are the assignments due, and all that, then everything is going to be fine.\r\n\r\nWe have been doing, and still are doing a lot of group work in groups, and that's a very good thing to do I think, but for me at least, it has been quite a challenge.\r\n\r\nI have been studying law in Copenhagen, which is a quite conservative way of .. degree I should say, where we don't have any work in groups at all.\r\n\r\nSo it was a new thing for me to do down here, and it has been a challenge to kind of deal with that way of working, and actually figure out how to actually work in teams, and there has been some issues that you have to deal with.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll just say that people should be prepared that a lot of group work, that a lot of assignments have to be done in groups, and it's important that you communicate very clearly within the group, so everybody kind of knows what are the expectations of the members, and that you communicate what is it that we are going to do here, and that you follow up on each others work all the time .. if you learn to do that, I'm pretty sure it will be good in the end.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/z3DVP6QIFNc\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nI think in our classroom the international students could encourage themselves to ask some questions, because if they don't open their mouths maybe they lose more confidence.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the students could stop the teachers speech, and ask questions if they want, so this is very different, and the teachers always encourage the students to answer questions, or ask questions, so this is a big difference for Chinese students.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\nMore in this tutorial\r\n\r\n \tUnderstanding referencing\r\n \tStructuring assignments\r\n \tDeveloping critical thinking\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Studying in a foreign country often involves new ways of learning and new approaches to assessment tasks.

Keep reading to find out.\r\n\r\nWhy is referencing important?\r\nIn 'western' universities, academic knowledge is built around different and often competing theories. One of the roles of academics\/scholars is to research and develop their own theories, which are built on their own analysis and understanding of previous knowledge. The knowledge produced by individual academics is seen as their creation or product and therefore their intellectual property. This means:\r\n\r\n \tauthors have\u00a0'ownership' of their own ideas\r\n \teveryone who uses these ideas\u00a0must acknowledge\u00a0who owns them. In academic writing this is done by\u00a0referring to\u00a0(or\u00a0referencing) the 'owner' or original author.\r\n\r\nWhat is expected of students?\r\nStudents are expected to:\r\n\r\n \tread widely\r\n \twrite about the different theories in their field\r\n \tdemonstrate knowledge of these theories as they apply to their assignment topic\r\n \tacknowledge (or reference) the original sources of their information\r\n\r\nIf students do not acknowledge the authors of their readings it is considered to be plagiarism, a form of cheating.\r\nMore information\r\n\r\n \tAcademic integrity\r\n \tLibrary referencing guides\r\n \tReferencing\r\n \tParaphrasing\r\n\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was referencing a new skill for you?\"\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Videos\"]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0KiyQ2jmcFY\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nI found that here at RMIT that referencing is very important. Now having done my Bachelors back home, I knew it was too, and I had been socialised into referencing.\r\n\r\nIt's just that the extent to which it is emphasized here is a whole lot more different, and there's a whole lot more emphasis on referencing, and a particular type of referencing.\r\n\r\nSo you really have to learn it, otherwise you get into trouble for plagiarism and stuff. So you must learn and it's a good idea to ask also even if you knew .. like I was familiar with APA and a bit of Harvard.\r\n\r\nThere's a whole lot more emphasis on actually changing the information that you extract from the source. They really want you to put it in your own words so that was new for me .. it was very new.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nYSVGJAc1UM\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nI think that the first thing that comes to my mind is the referencing. That is something which is really, really stressed over here, and not as much stressed in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nIt is taught to the students but at graduate masters level, not at undergraduate level, so they're innocently and are plagiarising a lot of other people's work, and the stress over here is more on quoting with proper references, and I think that's a major thing that international students need to learn, and it's not that difficult either. You just need to get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nThere are so many online resources available. There are so many books available for that, and you can, just while you are studying, you can develop that habit of referencing everything.\r\n\r\nIntellectually, everybody should be aware of the need of understanding the intellectual ownership of somebody's work. But that is not that much stressed in our country, and we believe that if you quote somebody who has already done some work and even if we repeat that person's words, we are actually honouring that person, that we are quoting his or her study.\r\n\r\nBut the problem starts from where we don't actually attribute that work to a particular person, or particular organisation, which is a by product of their efforts, and we need to acknowledge that.\r\n\r\nIt was was an idea which I struggled with for some time when I came here, and a lot of other international students also struggle with that, and we can't seem to understand why we have to reference each and every sentence that use of any other person.\r\n\r\nAnd I think knowing the reasons behind doing that, is more of a problem rather than learning to do it, because, there are so many on-line reference guides that you can learn to use. And there's this Endnote\u00ae program which will do it automatically, almost automatically for you as well.\r\n\r\nStudents need to, especially during the first semester, students need to make special efforts to understand the concept of plagiarism, and referencing, and how does it work, and how does it affect their future publications and their future academic endeavours.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1motPdbZfrY\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nOf course I cannot come up with something and take the credit for it, if it's not the work of myself.\r\n\r\nThe Study and Learning Centre at the Learning Lab they have a very good resource on the RMIT website where there's very good help to actually find out how exactly it's going to look where are the commas put, and how do I put the brackets and all that stuff, so that's a good resource.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UpVv4Z_7PDc\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nEverything .. the style and the actual thing, how you put it in your assignment, because you have to say, this person said this and that, and you support yourself, but for me I haven't done it so it was totally different idea.\r\n\r\nI think I understand more about how referencing works, and why do you need to reference, because it's a big thing, and now I understand that.\r\n\r\nWhy do I have to reference because, if I write something like a book or something, of course I really want to be acknowledged. So this is acknowledging somebody else's work so knowing about it is really important, finding out about it from the library from the learning HUB.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of resources that you can do, so by not knowing how to reference, how much you lose the marks is really painful.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]","excerpt":"Not sure why referencing matters?

Remember it is important to:\r\n\r\n \tplan and structure your essay\r\n \tuse the linear structure.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\nAssessment tasks\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was the approach to assignments different in Australia compared to your country?\"\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Videos\"]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-NnnYcpZLM4\"]\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThe teachers here have a particular way, there's a particular style of writing that they adhere to, that they subscribe to and that they expect.\r\n\r\nFor instance if you write an assignment in an essay form they much rather that you are direct. You say the point first and then you support it, state the point, support it and give examples.\r\n\r\nFor instance whereas I would given any assignments before I come to the main point I am more used to giving more of the background and saying everything else and then zeroing in on it at last. And I would just find that even with exactly the same information, depending on how you presented it, the grade that you would get for it would be very very different. It varies depending on how you have done it.\r\n\r\nThe structure is very important. You've got to do an introduction, you've got to do the body and you've go to do your conclusion or your summary.\r\n\r\nAnd I've actually found that right here what they expect in the conclusion is a summary of whatever else was discovered. It's not a good idea to bring in new information in the conclusion. So it's small things like that.\r\n\r\nYou may have everything that's needed actually it may be all in there but it's just the way that you're putting it. At first it seems a little intimidating, I was a bit annoyed by it, especially because everything was in there. If you really took up my paper and you read all the points that were required were there, so I just was annoyed.\r\n\r\nBut then after thinking about it and listening and trying it a different way I actually realized it made reading the paper a whole lot easier actually. It made it a lot more clearer and it's easy to pick up. That way it's easy to distinguish from somebody who's not sure what's being asked and is giving all the information that they can come across or is it somebody that exactly knows what's being what they are being asked.\r\n\r\nSo you do learn even though sometimes it doesn't feel like, whilst you're going through it it's a little painful. But actually you do learn and it's not bad at all.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nend-8gQNDI\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nI would say that they shouldn't get overwhelmed by the different learning style and the different learning system. It's just how you approach it in the beginning. I think you need to basically need to develop some kind of understanding before you begin to write anything before you start preparing for an assignment.\r\n\r\nStudents should take out some time and develop this basic... clarities about what is expected out of them and what really the lecturer is looking for, and if there is some specific type of assignments that they have been given, for example like a critical essay, or a reflective memoir, or something like that then they will need to first, get clear information about what basically a critical essay is all about.\r\n\r\nAnd they can find these kind of information, either from the website, from the learning and skills website, that's a really good helpful resource.\r\n\r\nSecondly they can ask their teachers. I found that the teachers and the lecturers, they are really really helpful about that. So the good start is the key to success.\r\n\r\nThe structure of writing over here was very different. I found it a real struggle here because the expectation of the teachers was quite different from what was expected in my country.\r\n\r\nFor example in our sub continent in India and Pakistan the way we are taught to structure our essays is we don't come to the point directly we have to develop this major build up, and before coming to the point so that unless and until we don't have that huge context coming to that point, our lecturer wouldn't think that we have put enough effort into that, so but over here the thing was to go bang! Go to the point directly. And then you can start explaining OK why do you think that way, and then link it to the context and then again narrow it to the point that you initially began with and explain your opinion about that.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VdZcmBpHUxk\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nAlso, about writing assignments it's very important to learn or understand very clearly what the expectations are.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in university in Denmark it was much more writing an assignment that was the same thing every time you just pretty much wrote whatever you wanted but here it's a lot of focus on is this an essay, is this a report, is this a case study and there is lots of rules about how it needs to be done.\r\n\r\nSo it's very important to talk to your teacher, really listen to what they want. They will usually give you a structure and most of the time it's very important and it makes a big impact on your grade that you follow that structure.\r\n\r\nSo that's a big advice that you first of all really listen to what the teachers say and then if it's not clear that you ask again and make sure you know the difference between an essay and a report and all those kind of things.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/V2IJaw-DekQ\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThere were different kinds of paper you need to write, like the essays, sometimes you need to write a literature review, lab report and a thesis, and so on.\r\n\r\nHere we've got not only the individual assignments but the group assignments as well and in China we will normally just have the individual assignments. And the style of writing is quite different.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]","excerpt":"In Australian universities, the usual focus is on introducing the main point at the beginning of an assignment task.

Critical thinking is about asking questions and then making evaluations or judgments and is fundamental to tertiary study.\r\n\r\nSo what is critical thinking?\r\nIn some cultures, being critical is considered unpleasant and even disrespectful. However, in tertiary study critical thinking is an important skill to develop. Critical thinking is about asking questions and then making evaluations or judgments and is fundamental to tertiary study. This is also called critical analysis. Often when students first enrol at university they are more familiar with summarising or describing information and ideas. However, as part of a tertiary program students are expected to develop a critical approach to their study.\r\nWhy is critical thinking challenging?\r\nCritical thinking is a skill, which is difficult for all students. This is because students are required to develop their own judgments or views of published authors. This questioning approach may be considered disrespectful of the knowledge of published authors in some cultures. A critical approach demonstrates that the student has thought deeply about the topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps in critical thinking\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysing\r\n\u2192 By asking questions of the material you are studying\r\n\u2193\r\nMaking judgments\/evaluations to\r\n\u2193\r\nDeveloping your own position\/argument\r\nBased on your readings, lectures, tutorials etc. in your assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nAn essay task, which starts:\r\n\r\nCompare the theories of Author. X and Author. Y ...\r\n\r\nThis task is asking the student to examine the similarities and differences between the theories of Author X and author Y and then to judge or evaluate them. Based on evidence students are required to develop their own analysis\/ideas about the ideas of others. It is not good enough to just summarise the theories of each author because this does not show that you can evaluate them.\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was critical thinking a new skill for you to apply at RMIT?\"\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Videos\"]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IsatjX5facc\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThere's a bit more emphasis on critical thinking here, it's required of you. And that would be, for instance, giving an assignment.\r\n\r\nFor instance having been asked to do a literature review on a topic, it's not just a question of reviewing the literature and putting the views together or organising them. On top of that you've got to critique them, and state what you think, what are your views given all the evidence, or all the opinions, or what do you question, what do you support, and why. What could have been better.\r\nA topic that may have been given, you really have to always think OK was that really good? Could you have done well without it, why did somebody come up with such a theory, and was it really necessary or they just didn't have anything else to do. It's things like that, and it can be demanding especially when you are used to just pointing out facts.\r\n\r\nNow having to go further and think about those facts, and teach you something from it can be quite a task.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LWE7BnWbL28\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThinking critically that is again an issue for most international students.\r\n\r\nI always thought that what the educationalists, the academics are saying, that is it. I don't have the capacity to actually criticise that, or to add something to it, I should just believe it as such, and for me it was really different, and when I started writing, I realised that there was so much that I had to say. And that what I had to say was also important.\r\n\r\nAnd it really helped me in doing my other assignments as well, because it developed that kind of critical monologue within myself so it was really helpful, I think.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript]\r\n[\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EdzHJajiY1c\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nWhen I recall my learning experience, I think there are two points that should be adjusted for international students who come from an Eastern educational background.\r\n\r\nThe first one is reading with critical eyes.

Tense use can vary a little with subject areas, so check the literature in your field for guidance. Here are some general patterns of tense use.\r\nPresent tense\r\nUse present tense to discuss findings from the literature that are generally considered factual and current.\r\nFor example: Trang (2020) emphasises that this is not the case.\r\nPresent perfect tense\r\nUse present tense to give the general background of past research and to show that previous research still influences current thinking.\r\nFor example: Research has indicated that economic factors are a major influence on the outcomes of planning strategies (Kendall, 2021; Steadman, 2022).\r\nPast tense\r\nUse past tense:\r\n\r\n \tWhen describing how a previous study was conducted.\r\nFor example: Smith (2021) conducted a review of data from 2022.\r\n \tWhen referring to specific findings of previous studies.\r\nFor example: Lee (2023) found that resource provision was problematic in this case.\r\n \tWhen referring to information or theories that were considered true in the past, but outdated today.\r\nFor example: Caldez (1932) claimed that the use of lead in paint created a faster-drying product.\r\n\r\nTest your knowledge\r\n","excerpt":"In academic writing, it is necessary to refer to research from others using reporting verbs.

I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University and I\u2019m going to talk about structuring your thesis literature review. There are many ways of structuring literature reviews. Some theses can have more than one lit. review chapter, others have just a few pages as part of the thesis introduction, and others have the lit. review in segments throughout the thesis. This information is a general guide only \u2013 remember to always check with your supervisors.a look at the overall structure of a lit. review.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the 4-part module on structuring your literature review. The objectives of this module are to understand the overall structure of a lit. review and to be able to structure the introduction to a lit. review. Let\u2019s have a look at the overall structure of a lit. review.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about writing a lit. review is to plan it so that it shows the relationship of the relevant literature to your study clearly and logically. The lit. review must be read as an integrated part of the story of your research, as you can see in this diagram. Your research story begins with the research question or questions; we also need to identify what\u2019s already known about this, how you found answers, what the answers are, and finally what the answers mean.\r\n\r\nAs with all academic writing, there needs to be an introduction, a body, and a conclusion or summary. In general, most literature reviews begin broadly and narrow down the focus. We start by giving the context, narrowing it down to identify the gap in the literature where your study fits. This is then summarised and once again explicitly related to your research topic. Now let\u2019s talk about the introduction to your lit. review.\r\n\r\nSo, what is an introduction? This needs to define the context within which your study sits very clearly through the general literature. This is where you could point out: major gaps; overall trends or prevalent themes; and mention any major areas of dissent or controversy But it needs to be done in a general way so it\u2019s not repeated in the body. Remember, you\u2019re just introducing the reader to the relevant literature. Also, don\u2019t forget to let the reader know some of the main areas you\u2019ll discuss in the body of the lit. review, and you might also want to mention the scope \u2013 that is, what you will and what you won\u2019t cover.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of the introduction to a lit. review. The research topic is \u2018Contesting the culture of the doctoral degree\u2019. See how it gives the context in a general way. It becomes a little more specific here, and here These sections hint at some gaps in understanding and we can assume that they\u2019ll be addressed more fully in the body. The last paragraph briefly outlines the body of the lit. review. You can see here how the research topic has been brought in to remind the reader of the central focus of the lit. review. Here the scope of the lit. review is identified as being mainly focused on Australian doctoral programs.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rdNr96e4rT4\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University, and this is Part 2 of the module on structuring the thesis literature review. The objective of this section is to understand a range of ways to structure the body of the literature review.\r\n\r\nThe body of a lit. review often begins by highlighting the major concepts and influential studies. We also need to look for areas of agreement, tensions, inadequacies and controversy, grouping together authors who say similar things and constructing debate with others who disagree. It\u2019s usual to gradually narrow the focus to studies closest to your own towards the end, until you identify the gap or space where your own research fits. One of the hurdles we have to overcome is to decide how to structure the body so that it tells the story of the literature that\u2019s relevant to your study in a clear and logical way, and we\u2019ll discuss this in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty most writers have is to move from the chaos resulting from copious amounts of literature \u2026 \u2026to an organised piece of writing that flows clearly.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one way many writers attempt to organise the body of the lit. review. A paragraph on one researcher\u2019s ideas, then a paragraph on another researcher\u2019s ideas, etc, etc. But this is not an effective way of organise the literature because all it does is tell the story of each writer, not the story of what\u2019s known around your research topic.\r\n\r\nSo what are some of the ways in which we can structure the body of the lit. review? Here are some common structures that might provide the most logical way for your study, although it\u2019s important to remember that some lit. reviews also use a combination of structural approaches.\r\n\r\nIt can be structured around a couple of topics \u2013 this is common in research that examines the relationship between two variables. For example, in this simple lit. review, the topics are evident in the overall research topic: this researcher needed to look at the literature that discussed models of use and models of demand.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do it is chronologically. This is useful when the emphasis is on the development of practices or theories over time. It\u2019s usually ordered from more distant to more recent.\r\n\r\nFor example, this lit. review moves from the antecedents of building regulation (2.2) through Settlement, to Federation, to post-Federation and ends after World War II. You might notice that this lit. review doesn\u2019t have an identified introduction or conclusion. However, the first section functions as an introduction and there is much contextual information in the sections before 2.2, when the chronological information begins. The last paragraph of the final section also functions as a conclusion and identifies the link between the lit. review and the research topic.\r\n\r\nYou could also structure your lit. review through different theories. Here\u2019s a good example of using a combination of structures. Notice that there are 2 lit. review chapters; Chapter 2 discusses a variety of theories relevant to the research topic and debate, while Chapter 3 is structured around themes.\r\n\r\nAnother way of doing it is through methodologies. This lit. review discusses qualitative and quantitative studies separately. It also has a meta-analysis, which is common in disciplines such as psychology.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to structure the lit. review body, though, is around themes or concepts. Here\u2019s an example of a series of themes, moving from a general understanding of knowledge, to knowledge management, to the more specific ICT in knowledge management and associated issues and concerns.\r\n\r\nThemes are most often arranged from those more general to the more specific. But at the same time that it\u2019s moving from the general to the specific, it\u2019s also becoming more conceptually dense. More concepts are being discussed, and all with a greater intensity and narrowing of focus. This is further explained in the practice activity in Part 3. The key thing here is to never let sight of your own research topic \u2013 ALL of the literature has to relate to it in some way.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XYYYYBw8KS0\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. Welcome to the 3rd part of the module on structuring a thesis literature review. Part 2 of this module showed many possible structures for the body of the literature review, but we didn\u2019t discuss the issues involved in deciding on the order of the sections and sub-sections within the structure. The objective of this session is to understand the kind of questioning and reasoning that could lead to a clear and logical structure. To do this, I\u2019m going to take you through the process that I used, outlining some of the many issues I had to resolve. Of course, you\u2019ll have to make your own decisions about how you\u2019ll order your literature review, but this resource should indicate the type of reasoning that can be useful in this process. Remember that you can pause the video at any time to help you think through the process.\r\n\r\nMy PhD analysed the culture of the doctoral degree and doctoral candidates\u2019 experiences, and I felt that a thematic structure would be the most effective way to tell the story of the research around my topic. After a long, iterative process of reading the literature and identifying and adjusting themes, I decided that these themes were relevant to the study. But this order doesn\u2019t tell the story of the literature in a logical order. What\u2019s needed is to show some sense of hierarchy. The process of developing a hierarchy begins by looking for connections. In this case, it seemed that some of these themes were more distantly related to the study and, following the general to specific idea, these needed to go first. Pause the video and have a go at identifying these.\r\n\r\nHow did you go? It\u2019s not always as easy as it looks. I started by realising that these five themes helped to contextualise the study and needed to go first. But there\u2019s an obvious problem here with having recent innovations first, and the more general development of the doctoral degree last. The themes needed to be reordered to show the context more logically. The development of the doctoral degree has a historical focus so it seemed logical to discuss this first.\r\n\r\nDefinitions are usually also discussed at the beginning, and maybe this could have gone before the development, but in this case I placed it after it because the definition is complex - there are many types of doctoral degrees. And because this research is based on three different doctoral degrees, this theme is clearly more specific to the research topic than the general history of the doctoral degree in Australia. I decided to put the value of the doctoral degree right after defining it, because it\u2019s contested in a similar way to the definition. Recent innovations were discussed next because they\u2019re more closely related to the study topic. And only then could I discuss the tensions and contradictions in these recent innovations. Now let\u2019s have a look at the themes that are more closely related to the study topic. I realised that the themes seemed to fit into three logical groups. One is to do with supervisors \u2013 these themes both relate to this. Another is more directly related to candidates\u2019 experiences. And the third group relates to other issues in doctoral study.\r\n\r\nNow I at least had some rough organisation, but then I needed to check the order of these three groups. These are more general issues in doctoral practice so, following the general to specific idea, I put them before the more closely related issue of candidates and supervisors. Because the main focus of the study is candidates\u2019 experiences, these needed to go last. Then I needed to review the order within these three groups.\r\n\r\nIn the first group it didn\u2019t seem to matter which order these were put in (and sometimes, there really is no logical way of ordering themes). However, the literature around these themes showed that the factors impacting on successful completion relied on an understanding of student diversity. Writing issues is a little more specific to the research and seemed to work best at the end of this group.\r\n\r\nIn the themes related to supervision, again, at first there didn\u2019t seem to be any reason for any particular order. However, the literature revealed a strong argument that the practice of supervision is under-theorised, so it worked better this way around.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the last group and, this time, there was no particular reason for changing this order other than my preference for discussing the positives before the negatives.\r\n\r\nSo now I had a list of themes in a clear and logical order. But there\u2019s another issue I had to think about. Although I had created three groups of themes, there was nothing to hold the groups together, so I needed to create headings for them. And then I needed to show the hierarchy between the headings and the subheadings by indenting the latter. And then, of course, I needed to have an introduction at the beginning and a conclusion or summary at the end. And in this case, I decided on a section explicitly relating the literature to the study.\r\n\r\nIn a final check, though, I realised that all the themes and sub-themes from \u2018Issues in doctoral practice\u2019 to the end are all issues in doctoral practice, but the hierarchy doesn\u2019t show this. I needed to show all of the remaining themes as a sub-set of \u2018Issues in doctoral practice\u2019 by indenting them.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1LFrFGHwbxo\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University and this is Part 4 in the series on structuring a thesis literature review. The objective of this section is to identify the elements of a typical literature review conclusions or summary section.\r\n\r\nNow you\u2019ve put the body into a logical order, it\u2019s time to ask \u2018So what!\u2019 In the conclusion or summary you discuss the significance of the key literature and evaluate the body of knowledge generally. You can do this by summarising the key literature and major contributions, and identifying general inconsistencies and gaps in the lit. Once again, don\u2019t forget to relate this to your research question or problem.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a couple of examples of lit. review conclusions. You can see here where the major contributions of significant research have been identified. Then the gaps in research are identified, and finally, the lit. review is related to the present study by showing how the gaps will be filled. Here\u2019s another example of conclusions. The first paragraph summarises the major research in a general way. This is made more explicit in the second paragraph, and the last paragraph rounds off the chapter with a hint of what\u2019s next: Bourdieu\u2019s ideas are explained in the very next chapter.\r\n\r\nBecause the literature is summarised, there are no citations in either this or the previous example, and it\u2019s important not to bring in any new lit. into the conclusions. One or two examples of key literature are sometimes cited, but this would already have been discussed in the body. There\u2019s also no discussion of gaps or inconsistencies in the literature here, because in this case the last section of the body of the lit. review has fully discussed these.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the previous example, here are first three paragraphs from the section before the conclusion section. You can clearly see that each paragraph discusses the gap in the literature, and that each of these is related to how the current study will attempt to address these gaps. It also identifies the main focus of the literature and justifies the current study by highlighting a key concern in the literature.\r\n\r\nSo what now? The best way you can get a feel for what\u2019s possible in your lit. review is to read others, particularly from the same subject area. You\u2019ll find other databases of theses in your library. If you\u2019re an RMIT student, a good starting place is the guide to finding and obtaining thesis. Here are also some other online resources you might find useful.\r\n\r\nHere are some guiding questions to help you when you read other theses. This brings us to the end of the presentation. Now it\u2019s up to you to put this into practice in your own lit. review. To get a complete picture of how to structure your thesis lit. review, it\u2019s important to look at each of the four parts of this module, but remember that writing conventions differ between disciplines, and you still need to be guided by your supervisor. We wish you well in your studies.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]","excerpt":"Watch a series of four videos explaining how to structure a literature review.

The videos, tutorials and links on this page will get you off to a strong start.\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n\r\nChoose, define and refine your topic\r\nDo you have the question or topic for your literature review clearly defined? A lot of time and effort can be wasted unless you do. View this video to break through that starting barrier, find a direction and get your literature review on track.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ehzxzhgCmUc\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s explore the levels of thinking that are required for writing a good critical literature review. Writing a critical literature review requires more than just setting forth lots of facts collected from different sources. Benjamin Bloom developed his taxonomy - that is a classification system - of cognitive levels. The lower levels of knowledge, comprehension and application are simply knowing stuff, understanding what it is about, and knowing how to use it.\r\n\r\nAt tertiary level, however, we are expected to work at the levels above this, namely analysis where you pull an idea or a concept apart to find out what it is about; synthesis is where you take different ideas from different sources and combine them into a new understanding, and you do a lot of this in a literature review. And finally, evaluation, where you keep a critical eye open, make judgements on what you read or hear, and even accept or reject the ideas with your reasoning of why you did so.\r\n\r\nThis is something you need to do in a critical literature review. You are encouraged to be judicious on the validity or the importance of a writer\u2019s opinion, as long as you have sound arguments in support of your decisions. The point here is: you need to do more than to collect and organise already existing information. This means that you are operating within the lower three levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, and this is less than what you are expected to do in higher education. You need to create a new overall understanding or a new insight into an issue. Creating new knowledge is what the upper three levels are about. In a literature review, you are not creating new knowledge in terms of experimental data, of course, but you are creating your own interpretation of the information that is available.\r\n\r\nIt is most important to choose your topic wisely in the first place. Choose a topic that actually is arguable. If there is no dissent or controversy about an issue, procedure or theory, you will find that you\u2019ll be reproducing accepted facts and there will be no room - or reason - to take a stand one way or the other. On some topics, not all researchers are of all the same opinion. They may agree in part, but vary on the details, or they may in fact be diametrically opposed. These disagreements are to be relished, rather than avoided, because it affords plenty of room to make sense of it yourself, and that makes the topic much more interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you were to choose something in the area of mental health for example, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, there is little point telling your readers what these conditions entail - this has already been done. The extent to which these conditions could be moderated with diet for example, is still opened to question. And this question is, therefore, worth exploring.\r\n\r\nIf you can, choose a topic that has relevance and importance. This does not mean that it has to about finding the cure for cancer. The question of whether handwashing with soap and water is better than hand rubbing with anti-bacterial gel, for example, may sound insignificant at first, but it is hugely relevant to a wide number of health professionals. Therefore, this question matters! And, incidentally, there is a broad spectrum of opinions about this question on both sides.\r\n\r\nFinally, just to keep yourself on track, turn your topic into a question. A general topic - such as the benefits of hand rubbing - does not imply a specific focus, and you can easily end up collecting a large amount of information on this subject. If you turn your topic into a question such as, \u201cis hand rubbing more effective than handwashing?\u201d, or more specifically, \u201cis hand rubbing the more effective method in the operating theatre environment?\u201d, this gives you something to to respond to; it keeps you on a defined path.\r\n\r\nWhen told to choose something controversial, this means simply arguable, and something for which there is not one widely accepted point of view. It does not necessarily mean to choose one of the socially controversial topics, such as abortion or euthanasia. In fact, I would be very wary of doing so, unless you feel equipped to argue using philosophy, ethics, social theory or theology. Many of these issues have a large moral component and for an academics essay, you would be expected to draw on these sources to make your points.\r\n\r\nWhether you feel something is right or wrong is not enough in an academic text. These emotive topics can easily diverge from the field of medical science into ethics, unless you define your question very clearly to keep them there. Lastly, it is a literature review and not a commonwealth-funded task force - you don\u2019t need to solve the problem, or even come up with recommendations necessarily. For a literature review, you are required to say what the experts have already said on your chosen issue. Just find what is already out there in the literature, and help your reader make sense of the wide variety of the perspectives.\r\n\r\nCluster your literature around common themes or threads of ideas. Structure your writing thematically and not author by author. This allows you to compare, contrast, and make sense of the different authors\u2019 perspectives on one point.\/ And if you find there are a lot of authors with some contribution to one point, then maybe that point needs to be teased out into sub-themes.\r\n\r\nTry not hide behind what the literature is saying. Remember, it is up to you to interpret it and make sense of it for your reader. Listing what they have found or believe is part of a literature review, but in itself is not enough, you need to clarify what the reader is to take away from this body of research.\r\n\r\nNever be afraid to narrow your topic. You have a word limit, which is enough to make one meaningful point, but not to include detail for its own sake. It is better to dig deep into a topic rather than be broad and superficial. Make your question more specific, such as, \u201cis hand-rubbing more effective in operating theatres?\u201d, or \u201ccan diet moderate schizophrenia at onset?\u201d.\r\n\r\nYou may have to limit you question many times before you submit your draft. This does not diminish the quality of your research, it actually enhances it. So, think long and hard about your question, because this provides the guidelines for your writing and your research. You need to have clear guidelines so that you can research with purpose and efficiency, even if these guidelines get modified at a later date. Otherwise a lot of time and energy will be wasted, either, looking at irrelevant material, or material that cannot fit into your review.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nThe research timeline\r\nDo you spend hours (if not weeks) printing off more information than you will ever need for your assignment? Thorough research is important but some students get stuck at this stage. Stop the madness and watch this video to see how to keep the research process efficient, effective and moving forward.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/19NrSmRGs0Q\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re writing on a topic that you know little about, it is worthwhile to get acquainted with the area before you define your question. This means reading generally and broadly but with the aim of moving towards a more targeted search. Avoid getting comfortable in this general reading phase, you need to move beyond this as soon as you can by defining the question yourself \u2013 even a tentative one \u2013 so that you can start making progress.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, set a date to turn your contemplation into action. Once you\u2019ve defined a question, you have automatically narrowed the field. You will start to know what you are looking for, and will feel less overwhelmed by the massive amount of information at your fingertips. If you are feeling overwhelmed, it is likely that you do not have a clear enough idea of what you are looking for. Then, you need to revisit and perhaps refine your question.\r\n\r\nAfter your general reading and defining some question, time for a brainstorm. Put everything down on a large sheet of paper. Use mind maps or lists to see what you can explore. But a mind map will lose form very quickly, if there is no purpose or question underpinning it.\r\n\r\nReading, writing, refining and redefining your topic are all cyclic and interlinked parts of your research process. Don\u2019t wallow in the information collecting phase for too long though; the writing process clarifies your thoughts and therefore the outline of the review. When you know what you are looking for, you can go back to the literature.\r\n\r\nThis may open up new avenues to explore, which again, may mean redefining your question. The notes you make are only raw material only when you put them into paragraph form, and until then, they have no place or function. The only thing more effective than defining a question is to start getting something down on paper, and this will really make your searches more targeted, because your information gaps will be made obvious.\r\n\r\nEven if you don\u2019t feel ready to call it your first draft, call it \u201cdraft minus 10\u201d. The process of writing is a huge part of clarifying your own thoughts, and giving your writing a direction. The early stages of mainly researching will transition to mainly writing with very specific searching. But on the whole, writing and researching have a symbiotic interaction throughout.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a bird does not build its nest by collecting a huge number of twigs, stop, and frantically assemble them in one day. However, many students research and write their essays just in that way. The bird starts with the basic structure of their nest early on, and collects and build things as needed. We could learn from this example in our own writing \u2013 put pen to paper as soon as possible. Writing is part of the research process, it is not the end point.\r\n\r\nYou have now complete the Literature Review module. We hope you have enjoyed the content.

This page gives you some tips for how to get started using these techniques.\r\n\r\nSkimming\r\nThis involves reading through a text quickly to get a general idea of its contents. To skim, do not read every word. Rather, pay attention to:\r\n\r\n \tkey words and phrases\r\n \tnumerical data and dates\r\n \tcapitalised words and phrases\r\n \tbulleted points and numbered lists\r\n \tanything in bold or italicised\r\n\r\nThese features often highlight important information.\r\n\r\nNote: for core texts that you must understand thoroughly, this reading technique may not be appropriate.\r\nScanning\r\nThis technique also involves going through a text quickly to find specific information. Again, you will not read every word. Instead, you read quickly until you come to the information you are looking for, and then you stop to read the information more carefully.\r\n\r\nBefore you scan a text, it is a good idea to have an idea of what you are looking for. For example, you might need to find statistics, or you might have some key words or phrases you need to find information about.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, let's imagine that you are studying the topic of censorship, and you have found an article to read. You might make a list of key words to look for that includes:\r\n\r\n \tcensor \/ censorship \/ censoring\r\n \tmedia suppression\r\n \tsilencing of media\r\n \tcorrupt \/ corruption\r\n\r\nWhen doing this, keep a look out for variations of the key words and phrases that might also appear in the text.\r\nExamples of skimming and scanning strategies\r\n\r\nRead the topic sentence for the main idea\r\nThe topic sentence of a paragraph tells the reader what the main idea is. It is usually the first sentence of a paragraph. Can you identify the topic sentence in this passage?\r\nThe Australian preferential voting system ensures the chosen candidate reflects the choice of most voters. In this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference on their ballots, instead of picking just one (Liu, 2024). For example, if no candidate gets more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is removed. Consequently, their votes are given to the next preferred candidate on those ballots. Therefore, this process helps to ensure that the winning candidate has wider support among voters.\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Answer\"]\r\nThe topic sentence of the paragraph is: 'The Australian preferential voting system ensures the chosen candidate reflects the choice of most voters'.\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nScan for key words\r\nImagine that you are studying a degree in politics and you need to find information on preferential voting systems.

While the information is still fresh in your mind, it\u2019s recommended that you organise it in a logical way. By doing this, it is less likely that you will need to go back and read the full text again; rather, you will be able to look at your notes to remember what you have learned.\r\nHow you do this depends on you and how you best retain information. Here are some ways to organise your notes:\r\nCreate a filing or tagging system\r\nHave you read something that gave you a new understanding of a topic? Or perhaps something that could be useful in the future? Or something that was not obviously relevant to what you are studying at the moment?\r\n\r\nYou could create a filing or tagging system to sort information into categories so that you know how it may be useful in the future. One way is to organise what you have read into topics, and another is to use tags such as:\r\n\r\n \tmust read\r\n \tuseful\r\n \tuse for assignment 1 \/ assignment 2\r\n \tnot immediately useful\r\n\r\nThen you have a few options. You could set up a folder with each of these names, or this information could be added into a file name, for example: The Science of Life- journal article- must read\r\n\r\nRemember that even if something is not obviously useful for the time being, it could be useful in the future. So, make sure you have your notes filed away so that they can be found if you need them.\r\nMind mapping\r\nMind maps are a great way to represent information visually as they show how issues or topics relate to each other. The  mind mapping page on the Learning Lab has information about how to get started with this technique.\r\nTables\r\nWhen used properly, tables can present information in clear and easily readable way. For example, you can include the publication details of the text you are reading, such as the author\u2019s name, the title and year of publication in one row. Then, you can have one column where you record the major themes and pages numbers, and a larger column where you write notes that come under those themes.\r\nCreate a glossary of new terms\r\nDid you come across some new terms in your reading? By creating a glossary of terms, you can keep track of the new concepts that come up in your reading. This can be as easy as creating a table with two columns in a Word document.\r\nMake a mock presentation\r\nAnother option for organising your notes it to pretend that you need to give a presentation about the article you have read. In this technique, you can create a PowerPoint or other type of presentation, write the publication details on the title slide, and then use the main themes that emerge as the titles for the subsequent slides, followed by dot points that expand on those themes. If visuals help you learn, you could include relevant images on the slides, or graphs, charts or tables that help bring the information to life.\r\nWrite a summary\r\nA typical way of organising information is to summarise it. In this technique, you can not only write down what the major themes of the text are, but also give an idea of what you thought about it, and how it might be useful to you in the future. By doing this, when you come back to the text after weeks or months, you will quickly be able to decide if it is something you should spend time re-reading, or if you should move on to another text.","excerpt":"Now that you\u2019ve done some reading, it\u2019s time to think about how you will organise this information so that you can use it to remember important points and concepts and so that it can be easily accessed should you need it in the future.

Indeed, widespread use of mobile devices in educational contexts for non educational purposes has been reported as distracting and disruptive to learning environments. Recently a number of university teaching staff have proposed that an institution wide policy be developed regarding student mobile phone use during tutorials and lectures.[\/hl] [hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the purpose.\"]This report will discuss research into staff attitudes to the issue of student mobile phone usage in the teaching and learning environment.[\/hl]\r\n\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Method\" heading-tag=\"h3\"]\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"1:Refer to relevant reading\/literature|2:Describe how the research was done\"]\r\n\r\n[hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is an example of referring to relevant reading\/literature\"]The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009).[\/hl] [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is an example of desescribe how the research was done\"]This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated university teaching staff attitudes to the use of mobile phones in tutorials (see Appendix 1).[\/hl] [hl id=\"1\"]The questionnaire used Likert scales to assess social attitudes (Jones 2007) to student mobile phone use and provided open ended responses for additional comments.[\/hl] [hl id=\"2\"]The survey was voluntary and anonymous.

Given that such high numbers of teaching staff (85 %) consider that student mobile phone usage in tutorials is a problem, clearly this is a teaching issue that needs to be addressed.[\/hl] [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is an example of integrating  different findings to create meaning.\"]Further, while the findings acknowledge a place for mobile phones in exceptional circumstances (62%) it would appear that a policy is required to make explicit acceptable guidelines for their usage.[\/hl]\r\n[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is an example of linking results to other research.\"]These findings are consistent with a number of other studies. According to Smith (2009) many educational institutions have identified mobile phones as disruptive to learning.Watts(2010) also claims that up to 30% of tutorial time is wasted through unnecessary phone interruptions. Other similar research shows \u2026.[\/hl]\r\nAnother significant finding of this study was that 80% of respondents found mobile phones distracted from the learning environment. This result differs from other similar studies. According to Lau (2011), staff were increasingly using mobile technologies in tutorials and saw them as a valuable addition to the classroom. Further to this, mobile technology has the potential to become a critical tool for teaching (Bond 2010). This difference suggests that the technology can be used effectively if it is integral to the learning process.

It covers the introduction, report structure and organisation, writing the report, and business writing. \r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PjYMxIWJNJs\"][transcript]\r\n\r\n Introduction   [slide 1: Topic slide]   [slide 2: Outline]   Description:   Sitting at the centre of the screen is: \u201cWhat am I going to be learning today?\u201d The following four words animate in:   - Introduction   - Report structure and organization   - Writing the report   - Business writing   Narration:   This resource covers three important features of the writing required for a successful business research report. Following this brief introduction, the second section covers report structure with a focus on suitable ways   to organize content. The third section outlines the features of persuasive writing. And the final section provides tips for strong effective business writing.   [slide 3: What is a business research report?]   Description:   A checklist of items that make up a research report:   - Formulates a research   - Reports on research findings   - Recommends actions to achieve desirable outcomes   And is written in a   - Business report format   - Professional business writing style   Narration:   This assignment provides you with the opportunity to research and write a real workplace report. It will inform the client of important aspects of their research brief. It will also provide recommendations to achieve desirable outcomes. The report will be presented as a written business proposal and as a presentation. This assignment requires a transition from academic writing to professional business writing. A business research report is written in a professional business style that differs from academic writing.   Report structure and organization   [slide 4: Topic slide]   [slide 5: Linear text structure]   Description:   [Graphic] Three babushka dolls representing each of the following:   - Whole text   - Section   - Paragraph   Narration:   Overall, reports have a highly structured linear form with a beginning, middle and an end. This is repeated at the section level and the paragraph level.   [slide 6: Part: 1 - Organising content]   Description:   A report structure should be broken down into sections, having a beginning, middle and end. An example of this is:   Beginning   - Executive summary   - Introduction   - Research question   - Problem, context and literature   Middle   - Methodology, approach and limitations   - Discussion and data analysis   - Implications (benefits and limitations)   End   - Recommendation and conclusion   - Considerations of policy adjustments and recommendations for further research   - References   A numbering system is used for the table of contents, and within them a broad example of a research page appears. Here it emphasizes the use of TEEL, and how each paragraph should be linked with one another.   Narration:   Reports are structured using sections that are clearly organized and use a numbering system. Paragraphs within the sections should be well structured   and ideas should be linked between paragraphs.   [slide 7: Part: 2 - Organising content]   Description:   An example of going from general to specific.   - Current trend for businesses to outsource non-core activities   - Increase in demand for Facilities Management (FM) services   - More integrated and strategic approach to providing FM services   - Business now delivers a range of services through a single contract. These include\u2026   Narration:   General to specific is a useful strategy for organising content in business writing. This is particularly helpful for giving background or an overview.

Report structure and headings.   - Report title and authors names   - Executive summary   - Introduction   - Research question   - Problem, context and literature   - Methodology, approach and limitations   - Discussion and data analysis   - Implications (benefits and limitations)   - Recommendations and conclusions   - Consideration of policy adjustments and recommendation for further research   - References   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 9: Executive summary]   Description:   [Text]   - Briefly summarise the whole report in a logical order   - Outlines context, rationale, objectives, findings, conclusions, recommendations   - Written last, mainly in past tense   Narration:   A strong executive summary is vital to a successful report as it determines the relevance of the report for the reader. It is the section the reader reads first and provides an overall summary of the whole report. Each major section of the report should be summarised in 1 or 2 sentences.   [Slide 10: Introduction]   Description:   [Text]   - Identifies the main context and issues   - Narrows to project aim\/purpose   [Text and graphic example]   Graphic of a triangle point downwards, writing from a general to specific.   Accompanying this the following text:   General (top of the triangle): \u2018PICA is a property and financial services company currently offering\u2026\u2019   Specific (bottom of the triangle): \u2018PICA requires a business plan for\u2026.\u2019   Narration:   Notice how the introduction narrows the topic from its broader context to the specific purpose of this report. The introduction is written from general to specific, which is a common form found in business writing.     [slide 11: Research question]   Description:   [Text]   Frames the whole report   [Text example]   This report aims to answer the question \u2018Is now a good time for PICA to diversify into Facilities Management (FM)\u2019?   - Sub-questions   - Sub-questions   - Sub-questions   Narration:   This research question frames the whole report and focuses the research to a specific area. It is common to have one research question followed by sub questions and these emerge from the larger question being answered.   [slide 12: Problem, context and literature]   Description:   [Text]   Outlines the general situation in the specific business area   - Definitions   - Competitors   - Financial background   [Graphic]   The accompanying graphic is of the triangle representation pointing downwards from general to specific.   Narration:   Problem, context and literature section of the report requires a general   Introduction to the business which then narrows to cover details of competitors and their financial background. Again you are writing from general to specific.   [slide 13: Methodology, approach and limitations]   Description:   [Text]   How?   The research uses an applied strategy with a change focus (Saunders, Lewis &amp; Thornhill 2012).   Why?   The main approach is data collection will be This methodology is appropriate because\u2026.   Details   The research is based on secondary data, both qualitative and quantitative   Limits   Limitations in the research include\u2026   Narration:   The methodology covers how the research was done, why these methods were chosen, the details of the methods used and the limits of stating explicitly what is covered and what is not.   [slide 14: Discussion and data analysis]   Description:   [Text]   Refer to your research   - Limitations in the research include\u2026   Compare to theory \/ other research   - Industry bodies and secondary research\u2026   - Eg.  This strategy encompasses all aspects of financial reporting (Faulding &amp; Lau 2011)\u2026    Sum up at the end of each section   - In summary, Sydney is well positioned for further growth in residential buildings that require FM services\u2026   Narration:   It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings.   [slide: 15: Implications: benefits and limitations]   Description:   [Text]   What do your findings mean for the client?   - The findings outlines above suggests that PICA\u2019s desire to enter the FM industry is expected to be beneficial given that\u2026   - NSW trends demonstrate\u2026   - Evidence suggests that PICA will be required to \u2026   - There are risks associated with entering the FM services market.   Narration:   It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings. You need to explain what your research findings mean for your client. These implications will lead into your recommendations in the next section.   [slide 16: Recommendations and conclusions]   Description:   [Text and Graphic]   Conclusion   - Restates purpose   - Provides \u2018the answer\u2019   - Provides a concluding statement   The accompanying graphic of a triangle representation, this time with it points upward -going from specific to general.   [Text]   Recommendations   - Suggests steps for further action   Eg. It is recommended that:   o PICA should enter the FM market   o Pica should acquire new\u2026   Narration:   The conclusion should provide a clear answer to the research question.   The conclusion is the reverse of the introduction it moves from answering the specific research question to showing how it fits into the broader context. In the recommendation section we return to the steps that this specific business should be taking as a result of the report.   [slide 17: Recommendation for further research]   Description:   [Text]   Outline other research   - Based on the research findings, it is recommended that further in-depth analysis be conducted of the competitive landscape.   - PICA should seek legal and tax advice in order to\u2026   Broadening the scope of the research   Examining certain issues in detail   Narration:   In the final section of your report, outline what other research you think the client should undertake. This could include broadening the scope of the current research or examining certain issues in more detail.   Writing the report   [slide 18: Topic slide]   [slide 19: Paragraphs: TEEL]   Description:   [Graphic and Text]   Buns top and bottom: Topic and linking sentence   Condiments and meat: Explanation, evidence and examples   [Text]   TEEL can be described using a burger metaphor. The topic and linking sentences make up the bun and base of the burger, and the evidence and explanations make the filling.   Narration:   A paragraph contains one main idea, which is found in the topic sentence.   It is best to put the topic sentence first in the paragraph as this makes reading easier. The rest of the paragraph is made up of explanation and evidence to support the topic sentence.   [slide 20: Paragraph structure: TEEL]   Description:   [Text example]   A sample of a paragraph structure is given using the TEEL structure; each of these parts is highlighted.   [Topic] Leighton Contractors is a large-scale FM operation with considerable FM expertise within its own group of companies [end-topic]. [Example] A brief analysis of Leighton\u2019s focus is helpful to PICA as it considers entry to the FM industry as PICA is considering a similar strategy [end-example]. [Evidence] The specific observation of this report is that Leighton focuses its FM operations into specific areas in which its group of companies has expertise, in particular in construction, telecommunications and mining (Leighton Constractors Pty Ltd 2009) [end-evidence]. [Link] This is a key observation as it affirms PICA\u2019s expressed desire to enter FM by leveraging its expertise in Strata Management [end-link].   Narration:   None.   [slide 21: Persuading the reader]   Description:   Grid of icons accompanying the following text:   - Strong topic sentence   - Introduction and summaries for each section   - Effective evaluation and analysis   - Integration of sources to support your view   Narration:   In a business research report your goal is to persuade the reader to follow your advice. Therefore, it is essential that they believe your understanding of the market is thorough and well researched. The following strategies are useful for writing persuasively.   [slide 22: Strong topic sentence]   Description:   [Text examples]   - [underlined] Evolution consulting [end-underlined] recommends that PICA consider acquiring the Port Stevens Group.   - [underlined] The hypothesis [end-underlined] is that now is a good time for PICA to diversify into FM.   Narration:   Strong topic sentences reinforce your argument and help persuade the reader. Both topic sentences below have a clear direct message.   Notice how the topic sentence comes at the beginning of the sentence.   [slide 23: Introductions and conclusions for sections]   Description:   [Text]   Introduction to a section   It is the belief of the research team that the successful entry into the FM sector will require PICA to target a specific building sub-market.   Conclusion to a section   In a conclusion, from the analysis of overall market trends, PICA would benefit from targeting the residential building sub-market.   Narration:   Use section introduction and summaries to clearly state and restate your view. This acts as a reminder to the reader and emphasises the consistency   of your argument.   [slide 24: Effective evaluation and analysis]   Description:   [Text]   - Paragraph strategy   And   - Sentence strategy   Narration:   It is essential to write convincing evaluations of the strengths, weaknesses and risks. It is this understanding that makes it possible for the company to make decisions about future strategy.   [slide 25: Paragraph strategy]   Description:   A graphic illustrating the narration:   At the beginning of a paragraph, the topic sentence (evaluation of risk) should be first written. Followed by an explanation and analysis. Lastly, providing a solution. The language used in the process, should be formal impersonal language.   Narration:   Here are two useful writing strategies, which make your evaluation   and analysis more effective. They are firstly clear paragraph organization   and secondly use of a formal impersonal style.   [slide 26: Sentence strategy]   Description:   [Text]   Use tentative language   This demonstrates you have a thorough understanding of the level of risk.   - It is advised   - Is minimized   - Will be made   Use passive form   Write in an impersonal style. Suggest your view is based on research rather than opinion.   - Could, would, may, might   - There is a view that,   - There is a perception that   Language   Use active verbs   Narration:   In business writing it is generally better to write in a   clear and direct style. This includes using active verb forms.   However, when evaluating risks it is useful to write in a more   tentative and indirect style. Using tentative language shows you have a complex understanding of the situation and are aware of the degrees of risk.   It is also useful to write in an impersonal style as this gives your writing authority. It suggest that you are stating the views of the industry or other experts, and not just your own opinion. Passive verb forms generally weaken business writing as they are indirect. However, they are useful in evaluation as their use emphasises the advice itself rather than the voice of the writer.   [slide 27: Integration of sources]   Description:   [Text]   - Supports your view with evidence   - Demonstrates the strength of your research and sources   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 28: Referencing in sentences]   Description: Sentence 1:   [Source] ACIF (2013) [end-source] projects that recovery will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014.   Sentence 2:   Recover of the construction sector will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014 [source] (ACIF) [end-source]   Narration:   There are two ways to include references in a sentence at the beginning or at the end. The difference between these two constructions is subtle but it changes the focus of the sentence.   [slide 29: Effects and emphasis]   Description: Sentence 1:   Source prominent   - Source (ACIF) emphasized as topic   - Common in academic writing where the research itself can be the topic   Sentence 2:   Information prominent   - Recovery emphasized as topic   - Common in business writing   Narration:   This sentence emphasizes the source of the information and is common in academic writing. This does not emphasize the view of the student or writer. This sentence puts the information at the beginning of the sentence and emphasizes the writers view. This is useful if the writer wants to persuade the reader to follow his or her advice.   Business writing   [slide 30: Topic slide]   [slide 31: Academic writing and business writing]  Description: Academic  Purpose:   Knowledge and research   Audience:   Lecturer   Writing:   - Expected structure   - Academic style   - Uses a range of sources  Business  Purpose:   Business decision-making and action   Audience:   Workplace \/ Industry   Writing:   - Expected structure   - Business style   - Uses sources with practical application   Narration:   There are differences between academic writing and business writing. In academic writing the overall focus is on knowledge and research. In business writing decision making and action are the goal. These differences are important and affect the writing style.   [slide 32: Tips for business writing]   Description:   Iconography for the following three points:   - Be direct: Darts board, aimed at the centre   - Be concise: Cutting out words (paper)   - Use strong active verbs: A man lifting up weights   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 33: Be direct]   Description:   Put the most important information first.  So people can easily find it.   Put the topic sentence at the beginning   [Example]   Whereas in the past, FM services were regarded as an overhead cost, the[emphasis] attitude towards FM services [end-emphasis]  have changed to now viewing these costs as life cycle costs (International Facilities Management Association 2011).   Versus.  [Emphasis] Attitudes towards FM services [end-emphasis] have changed from that of an overhead cost to a life cycle cost (International Facilities Management Association 2011).   Make it easy to read   Clear logical structure, headings, sub-headings and bullet points.   Narration:   People are busy and will read only minimally. Therefore, one very useful strategy in business writing is to put the most important information first,   so you know the audience will find it. Notice how the first sentence is more difficult to read. In the second sentence the topic is at the beginning of the sentence as this makes the point immediately clear to the reader.  [slide 34: Be concise]   Description: Cut out unnecessary words       Wordy phrases     Singular words       It is often the case that     Often       It is important to note that\u2026     Importantly       In the event that     If       Final completion     Completion       Consensus of opinion     Consensus       Summarise briefly     Summarise       Narration:   Use concise language by replacing wordy phrases with single words.   [slide 35: Use strong active verbs]   Description: Use strong active verbs   [Example 1]   ACIF [emphasis] believes [end-emphasis] that construction projects [emphasis] will experience [end-emphasis] considerable growth in 2014.   Versus   [Example 2]   ACIF [emphasis] forecasts [end-emphasis] considerable growth in residential construction investment in 2014.   Narration:   Strong active verbs convey a clear and remove the need for repetition.   [slide 36: Identify the weaknesses ]   Description: [Poor example]   In terms of non-residential construction projects ACIF (2013) expects that construction investments in NSW will be subject to a considerable growth rate, whereas investments in non-residential construction projects are expected to remain constant for all other region.   How this can be improved   Legend: [strikethrough] = Be concise. [Highlight] = be direct. [Emphasis] = Use strong active words.   [Strikethrough] in terms of [end-strikethrough] [highlight] non-residential [end-highlight] construction projects ACIF (2013) [emphasis] expects [end-emphasis] that [highlight] construction investments in NSW [end-highlight] will be [strikethrough] subject to a considerable growth rate [end-strikethrough] , whereas investments in non-residential construction projects [emphasis] are expected to [end-emphasis] remain constant for all other regions.   [Improved example]   In NSW, construction investment for non-residential projects will grow compared with other regions of Australia (ACIF 2013). \r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This page gives you an example report broken down into sections to provide a sample of how a report can be structured.

There are two stages in this process.\r\nFirst stage\r\nLook at the structure of the text, e.g. the Table of Contents, the Abstract, headings and sub-headings, to see if the text is suitable for your purpose. This will help you to locate relevant research quickly.\r\nSecond stage\r\nIf the text appears to be relevant for your purposes, then you can read it in-depth to find specific research to support your literature review.\r\n\r\nThese techniques enable you to identify appropriate material by reading widely and to gain a broad understanding of the available literature on your topic.\r\nObjectivity\r\nYou must be objective in your research. Remember the reason you are reading is to be able to give an evaluation and critique of the literature chosen. Do not just select the parts of the literature that agree with what you think is right.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - evaluating your reading\r\n\r\nIt is important to critically evaluate your readings to establish their relevance and credibility for your research topic. After all, you are basing your theoretical framework and your literature review on what you have read.\r\n\r\nYou can find a checklist of critical questions to keep in mind when you evaluate your readings.\r\n\r\nStep 3 - summarising, analysing and organising your readings\r\n\r\nIt is important that you make notes as you read. You should think about and include the following in your notes.\r\n\r\n \tThe main points\/theories\/key issues raised in the text, e.g. book or article.\r\n \tDetails of any quotes, or page references that you think may be good to use in your literature review.\r\n \tAll bibliographic information, e.g. author, date, title of book, publisher\/journal, page numbers, etc. For further information see guidelines for presentation of written work.\r\n \tThe author's stated or implied purpose.\r\n \tThe conclusions the author has made.\r\n \tThe points that support the conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is also useful to write down your own thoughts on\/about your readings. This will help you when you start to write.\r\n\r\nStep 4 - analysing and organising your summaries and notes\r\n\r\nUse your summaries and notes to identify relationships and links in the research literature.\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to identify:\r\n\r\n \tThe similarities and differences between various authors and their research.\r\n \tWhat research agrees and disagrees?\r\n \tWhat major questions remain unanswered?\r\n \tWhat are the possible directions for future research?\r\n\r\nOrganising your summary\r\nTo organise your research, cluster similar research together, e.g., what information is similar or different.

You may need to complete several drafts before your final copy. It is important to have a good introduction that clearly tells the reader what the literature will be about.\r\n\r\nAn introduction must tell the reader the following:\r\n\r\n \twhat you are going to cover in the review\r\n \tthe scope of your research\r\n \thow the review ties in with your own research topic.\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nThis is a good example of an introduction because it has a topic sentence which indicates what will be covered and also tells the reader the specific focus of the literature review in the concluding sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \t1 Topic sentence: identifies five major themes as the scope of this review\r\n \t2 Theme: The five major themes to be covered\r\n \t3 Concluding sentence: The\u00a0specific focus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[highlight-text]\r\nMany theories have been proposed to explain what motivates human behaviour. [hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the topic sentence. It identifies five major themes as the scope of this review.\"]Although the literature covers a wide variety of such theories, this review will focus on five major themes which emerge repeatedly throughout the literature reviewed.[\/hl] These themes are: incorporation of the [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is theme 1.\"]self-concept[\/hl]\u00a0into traditional theories of motivation, the influence of [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is theme 2.\"]rewards[\/hl]\u00a0on motivation, the increasing importance of [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Theme 3.\"]internal forces[\/hl] of motivation, [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Theme 4.\"]autonomy and self-control[\/hl]\u00a0as sources of motivation, and [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Theme 5\"]narcissism[\/hl]\u00a0as an essential component of motivation.[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the concluding sentence.\"]Although the literature represents these themes in a variety of contexts, this paper will primarily focus on their application to self-motivation.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n\r\nLecturer's comments\r\nNotice how the student has clearly said WHAT she will cover in this review. This is particularly important in a large topic area.\r\n2. Integration of multiple sources in paragraphs\r\nTo develop an integrated argument from multiple sources, you need to link your arguments together. The model below is a guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \t1 Topic sentence: outlining your main claim or key point for that paragraph\r\n \t2 Evidence: supporting evidence from the readings\r\n \t3 Contrast: contrasting theories\u00a0from research\r\n\t4 Conclusion: concluding sentence linking to the next paragraph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[highlight-text]\r\n[hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the topic sentence,  outlining your main claim or key point for this paragraph.\"]Most early theories of motivation were concerned with need satisfaction.[\/hl] [hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is supporting evidence from the readings\"]Robbins, Millett, Cacioppe and Waters-Marsh (1998) argued that motivation relies on what a person needs and wants. Similarly the early theories of Maslow and Mc Gregor (cited in Robbins et al. 1998) focused on personal needs and satisfaction as the basis for motivational behaviour.[\/hl]\u00a0[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is a contrasting theories\u00a0from research.\"] However, recent studies outlined by Leonard, Beauvais, and Scholl (1999) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.[\/hl] [hl id=\"4\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is a concluding sentence, linking to the next paragraph.\"]Current thinking does not discount these theories, but builds on them to include a self-concept.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Integration of student analysis\r\nIt is important to integrate your analysis and interpretation of the literature in your literature review. Read the following paragraph and see how the arguments have been integrated into the paragraph along with student analysis. Analysis is not just student opinion; it needs to be supported by the literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \t1 Topic sentence: outlining your main claim or key point for that paragraph\r\n \t2 Evidence: first statement of evidence from the literature\r\n\t3 Evidence: second statement of evidence from the literature\r\n \t4 Analysis: by the student\r\n\t5 Conclusion: concluding statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[highlight-text]\r\n[hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the topic sentence,  outlining your main claim or key point for this paragraph.\"]By its very nature, motivation requires a degree of individual satisfaction or narcissism.[\/hl]\u00a0[hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the first statement of evidence from the literature.\"]Robbins et al. (1998) suggest that motivation has as its basis the need to focus on, and please the self.[\/hl]\u00a0[hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the second statement of evidence from the literature.\"]This is supported by Shaw, Shapard and Waugaman (2000) who contend that this narcissistic drive is based upon the human effort to find personal significance in life.[\/hl]\u00a0[hl id=\"4\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is analysis by the student.\"]It can be argued that the desire to improve ones status is a highly motivational force, and is central to the idea of narcissistic motivation. The narcissistic motivational strategies put forward by Shaw et al. (2000) are concerned with motivation for life in general, but may also have applications in the context of work.[\/hl] [hl id=\"5\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is the concluding statement.\"]These strategies, with their focus on personal needs, demonstrate that narcissism is an essential component of motivation.[\/hl]\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Example of linking and reporting verbs\r\n[highlight-text key=\"1:Reporting verbs|2:Linking verbs\"]\r\n\r\nMost early theories of motivation were concerned with need satisfaction.

Essays have three parts: A beginning... A middle... and an end. That is, the introduction, body, and conclusion. It's important to have structure in your essay, or you will lose the flow of your argument.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay introduction? Writing an essay introduction can sometimes be quite challenging. It helps to break down your introduction into three important parts: First, start by introducing your topic. Then, state your argument. And finally, outline your main points.\r\n\r\nBy doing this, your introduction should start broad and become more specific, focusing in on your essay topic. Basically, you're letting the reader know what you're going to discuss throughout the essay. Let's have a look at this introduction as an example:\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence means possessing a positive, yet realistic, view of one's self and abilities. Self-confident people have trust and faith in their abilities. Self-confidence can be affected by a variety of factors. This essay will argue that self-confidence develops through a complex interaction between a range of factors. The essay will firstly define self-confidence, and then analyse the interaction between various factors that affect the confidence of an individual. In particular, these are personality style, situational factors\/life experiences self-efficacy and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nNotice the structure: The topic and context at the start of the paragraph; the argument in the middle, and what will be covered in the essay at the end of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay body? An essay body is a series of paragraphs that support the main argument.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay conclusion? Your essay conclusion is written in the opposite way to the introduction: it starts narrow and becomes broad. Begin with the detail of the essay, and expand out to the bigger picture. Here's an example of how to structure a conclusion:\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence is not ingrained within individuals and can be influenced by a variety of factors. The personality style of an individual can determine whether the individual is an introvert or an extrovert, which will affect self-confidence. Life experiences and situational factors have a large impact on the stability of personalities and confidence. Self-efficacy and self-esteem are major factors that can contribute to a lack of self-confidence. Self-confidence is essential for effective and positive engagement in all professional and personal activities.\r\n\r\nFor more information about essay writing, try the tutorials.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\nFirst steps\r\nCarefully read and analyse the essay topic and identify the key words. Generally, essay topics are made up of content, instruction and limiting words. Let's take a look at what each of these mean.\r\nContent words\r\nContent words tell you WHAT the topic is. They tell you which concepts the essay should be based around. They will often be words that you have encountered in your course, and by identifying them, you can have a good idea of what areas to review for your assignment. \r\nHere are some examples of essay prompts with content words italicised:\r\n\r\nExplain the process of photosynthesis in plants. Include the basic steps of chlorophyll.\r\nAnalyse the concept of democracy. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of representative democracy compared to direct democracy.\r\n\r\nInstruction words\r\nThese tell you HOW to write the essay. To identify them, Look for the key verb or verbs in the topic.\r\nFor example, assignments may require you to:\r\n\r\ninvestigate an issue\r\nexplain the relationship between topics or ideas\r\ndescribe or explain a process\r\nargue a point of view\r\n\r\nLimiting words \r\nThese words restrict the task. They set the scope of the topic and narrow down the topic area. Limiting words indicate the aspects of the topic that should be\r\nincluded and the boundaries of your discussion. \r\nFor example, an essay topic like \"Investigate the causes of pollution\" is a very broad topic. Your teacher might limit the scope of the topic by adding focusing on a particular type of pollution, and a specific place and\/or time period to it. To illustrate: \"Investigate the causes of water pollution in Melbourne, Australia in the last five years.\"\r\nRead the assessment criteria\r\nOnce you have broken down the question to understand what you have been asked to do, it is important to read the assignment brief in full. This way, you will discover any conditions that you need to follow, such as:\r\n\r\nword count\r\nrequired fonts and spacing\r\nthe required referencing style\r\nthe assignment due date\r\nAlso, read the assignment rubric thouroughly. This tells you how your assignment will be graded and how the person marking your work will be assessing your essay. By having an understanding of this information, you can make sure that you include all of the required elements of the assignment in your work.\r\nSample essay topic\r\nThe following essay topic has been broken down into content words, instructional words and limiting words.\r\n\r\n[highlight-text key=\"1:Content words|2:Instructional words|3:Limiting words\"]\r\n[hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"\"]Compare[\/hl] [hl id=\"1\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is a content word.\"]team models[\/hl] in [hl id=\"3\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, these are limiting words.\"]two contemporary[\/hl] organisations.[hl id=\"2\" screen-reader=\"Screen reader users, this is an instructional word.\"]Discuss[\/hl] the [hl id=\"1\"]effectiveness[\/hl] of these models [hl id=\"2\"]with reference to[\/hl] [hl id=\"3\"]current[\/hl] [hl id=\"1\"]management theories[\/hl].\r\n[\/highlight-text]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"An essay is a discussion in response to a question or statement.

However, knowing a few simple spelling rules can help to improve your spelling.\r\nAccurate spelling helps effective communication. To develop a professional level of communication, both for your studies and professional life after graduation, it is important to address spelling at the proofreading stage of assignment writing.\r\n\r\nIncorrect spelling can distract the reader from the point you are trying to make. With spell-check facilities on your computer and easy access to on-line dictionaries, you can take steps to eliminate spelling errors. There are also strategies you can use to improve your spelling more generally.\r\nPreferred spelling\r\nMost lecturers expect that you will use standard Australian English spelling. As you research widely, you are likely to come across other forms of spelling, including American English spelling. While some lecturers accept American spelling, others require standard Australian spelling. Both these group agree, however, that it is important to be consistent with your spelling throughout your assignment. To assist with this, set the language option on your computer to English (Australian).\r\n\r\nThe difference between standard Australian and American spellings is minimal and usually does not affect the reader\u2019s ability to understand what you have written. N.B. Some organisation names use the American style, e.g. World Health Organization.\r\nDictionaries\r\nTo improve your spelling and expand your academic vocabulary, you should access the largest and best dictionaries you can; a pocket dictionary may be cheaper and easy to carry around but is unlike to have the range of words you need. Choose a dictionary that suits your needs.\r\n\r\nSubject specific dictionary: contains specialised words related to the area you\u2019re studying that are not available in a standard dictionary.\r\nStandard English dictionary: RMIT prefers the Macquarie Dictionary.\r\nEnglish learner\u2019s dictionary: If English is not your first language, it can be worth investing in a specialised learner\u2019s dictionary.\r\nDictionaries are also available in the reference section of the library and many can also be accessed for free online, with some versions also providing audio to help with pronouncing specialist terminology.\r\nStrategies\r\n\r\n \tIt may help to see the word rather than just to spell it aloud.\r\n \tDevelop a mental picture of the word.\r\n \tUse the LOOK, SAY, COVER, WRITE, CHECK method.\r\n \tThink of any spelling rules that apply. Learn other words that use the same rule.\r\n \tLook for patterns or word groups (haematology, haemoglobin, haemostasis).\r\n \tLink the word to similar words you know [practise (verb), practice (noun): is (verb), ice (noun)].\r\n \tKeep track. Make a list of words that are causing you problems, for easy reference.\r\n\r\nLook, think, cover, write, check\r\nLOOK carefully at the word, its shape and parts.\r\n\r\nTHINK about :\r\n\r\n \tthe parts of the words which might cause problems, such as silent letters and vowels that are not pronounced as you would expect\r\n \tany spelling rules.\r\n\r\nCOVER the word and see it in your mind's eye.\r\n\r\nWRITE the word down without looking back.\r\n\r\nCHECK to see if you are correct. Repeat.\r\nBreak words into syllables\r\n\r\n \tIn-ter-net\r\n \tbe-cause\r\n \ttech-nol-o-gy\r\n\r\nthen look for words with the:\r\n\r\n \tsame chunks\r\n \tsame spelling of the chunks.\r\n\r\nRules\r\nHere are some helpful rules to apply to your spelling.\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Plurals\"]\r\nThese spelling examples demonstrate the English rules for making words plural.To make most words plurals you simply add an 's' to the end of the word\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingular\r\nPlural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndog\r\ndogs\r\n\r\n\r\ncat\r\ncats\r\n\r\n\r\ncar\r\ncars\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen words end in 'ch', 'sh', 'x', and 'ss', add 'es'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingular\r\nPlural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbox\r\nboxes\r\n\r\n\r\nboss\r\nbosses\r\n\r\n\r\npunch\r\npunches\r\n\r\n\r\npush\r\npushes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen words end in 'f' or 'fe', remove the 'f' and add 'ves'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingular\r\nPlural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhoof\r\nhooves\r\n\r\n\r\nthief\r\nthieves\r\n\r\n\r\nlife\r\nlives\r\n\r\n\r\nknife\r\nknives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Common spelling patterns\"]\r\n\r\nCommon spelling patterns for English word structures\r\nWords with a silent 'e'\r\nIf a word ends with a silent 'e', drop the 'e' before adding an ending that begins with a vowel. Common endings that begin with a vowel are 'ed', 'er', 'en', 'ing' and 'ous'.\r\nExamples\r\nripe + en = ripen\r\ntape + ed = taped\r\ntake + ing = taking\r\n\r\nIf a word ends in 'ce' or 'ge', you keep the 'e' when you add 'ous' or 'able'.\r\nExamples\r\nmarriage + able = marriageable\r\nservice + able = serviceable\r\noutrage + ous = outrageous\r\nDoubling the last consonant\r\nIn single syllable words ending in a consonant that follows a vowel, you double the consonant when adding 'ed', 'er', 'est' and 'ing'.\r\nExamples\r\ntap + p + ing = tapping\r\nrub + b + ing = rubbing\r\n\r\nIf there are double vowels before by a consonant', just add the ending 'ed', 'er', 'est' or 'ing'.\r\nExamples\r\nfeel + ing = feeling\r\nmeet + ing = meeting\r\nHomophones\r\nHomophones are words that sound the same but are spelt differently and mean different things. Learning to spell these words helps avoid mistakes in your writing. \u00a0If you are unsure about \u00a0the spelling, \u00a0use a dictionary or spell checker.\r\nExamples\r\nthere, their, they're\r\nknow, no\r\nweather, whether\r\nright, write\r\nhere, hear\r\nsauce, source\r\nbean, been\r\nWords with 'ie' and 'ei'\r\n'I' comes before 'e' except after 'c'.\r\nExamples of 'ie' words\r\nwield, field, yield\r\nExamples of 'ei' words\r\ndeceive, receive, receipt\r\nSome exceptions to this rule\r\nleisure, height, weight, their\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"Prefixes and suffixes\"]\r\n\r\nPrefixes are letters added to the beginning of a word to make a new word, suffixes are letters added to the end of a word to make a new word. It is helpful to know the meanings of prefixes and suffixes to improve your English language skills.\r\nPrefixes\r\nPrefixes are added to the beginning of a word to make a new word, e.g. mis+take. Some common prefixes are 'mis', 'dis', 're', 'for', 'anti', 'ante', 'sub', 'un' and 'in'. New words are made by placing a prefix in front of a word. It is helpful to know the meanings of prefixes.\r\n\r\nPrefix 're' means again,\u00a0therefore reappear means to appear again.\r\nCommon prefix meanings\r\npre - before\r\nmis - bad(ly)\r\nsub - under\r\ninter - between\r\nsemi - half\r\n\r\nThe following prefixes of 'im', 'ir', 'il', 'in' and 'un' can be added to the beginning of words to make them into a negative.\r\nExamples\r\nim + possible = impossible\r\nir + responsible = irresponsible\r\nil + legal = illegal\r\nin + active = inactive\r\nun + happy = unhappy\r\nSuffixes\r\nLetters added to the end of a main word are called suffixes. Common suffixes are: 'ed', 'ful', 'ly', 'ing', 'able', 'ance', 'ence', 'ness'.\r\nExample\r\nharm + less = harmless\r\n\r\nWhen 'full' is added to a word you drop the final 'l'. If you add 'ly' to any word ending with 'ful' you keep the existing 'l'.\r\nExamples\r\nhand + full = handful\r\nrest + full = restful\r\nrestful + ly = restfully\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n[ll-accordion title=\"English capitalization rules\"]\r\n\r\nFollow these conventions for using capital letters in academic writing.\r\nThe first word of a sentence or quoted speech\r\nMy first essay is due tomorrow.\r\nThe minister said, \"That compromise is not justified\".\r\nThe pronoun \u2018I\u2019\r\nJames and I are in the same group.\r\nAbbreviations and acronyms\r\nRMIT, ANZ, USB, DVD\r\nProper nouns (names)\r\n\r\n \tNames of people and their titles\r\nExample: Jenny, Brian, Professor Margaret Gardiner, Mr Nathan Buckley\r\n \tNames of specific groups of people, languages, and religions\r\nExample: Australian, Muslim, Asian\r\nNote: Aboriginal and Indigenous are used to refer to Australia\u2019s first peoples.\r\n \tNames of specific places on a map\r\nExample: Cardigan Street, Sydney Road, New York City, Federation Square\r\n \tNames of courses and school subjects with numbers\r\nExample: MATH2123 Mathematics and Statistics, Chemistry Unit 3, HUSO2162 Social History of Ideas\r\n \tTitles: the first, last, and all important words in titles (including books, newspapers, magazines, newspapers, plays, films, stories, songs, art works, television programs)\r\nExample: A Tale of Two Cities, The Age, Mona Lisa, Introduction to Academic Writing\r\n \tNames of specific geographic areas\r\nExample: South-East Asia, Southern Ocean, East Gippsland, Middle East\r\n \tTime indicators: names of days, months, special religious days and public events, historical and cultural periods, but NOT the name of seasons.\r\nExample: Monday, November, Mother\u2019s Day, summer, winter, autumn\r\n \tNames of specific structures\r\nExample: The Great Wall of China, Parliament House, Myer\r\n \tNames of organisations\r\nExample: Curtin University, Red Cross, Northcote Primary School\r\n\r\n[\/ll-accordion]\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"There are many ways people can improve their spelling.

Use the tutorials and study tips on this page to become familiar with this language style.\r\nMany students are not familiar with this concept. This short video explains what is meant by academic style and how this relates to your academic writing. It gives you practical guidance on how to write your assessment tasks in the correct style expected by your lecturers.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FvGLksxAu-Y\"][transcript]\r\n\r\nStudents are often told by their lecturers that they need to write their assignments in a more academic style. But what does this mean? The academic style is characterised by several features that makes it very different from speech-like writing or journalistic writing.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of the writing is that it is more formal. Formal language means that you must use full words in your writing. When we speak, we use contractions such as \"don't\" and \"doesn't\" and \"can't\". When we write, we must use the full version and write \"do not\", \"does not\" or \"cannot\". Personal pronouns such as\u00a0 \"I\", \"we\", or \"you\" are rarely used. And, of course, you should never use slang.\r\n\r\nUsing tentative language in your writing. Another feature of academic style is the use of tentative language. This is when you write about something without 100 percent certainty, leaving room for doubt. You should use words such as \"tends to\"... \"suggests that\"... and \"appears to\".\r\n\r\nAlso, be concise in your writing. Use one word instead of lots of words to say the same thing.\r\n\r\nFinally, be specific! Choose the best words for your meaning. Like in this example, the word students is more specific than people. Look at this example and think about how it could be rewritten in a more academic style:\r\n\r\nWorked example: In recent times, there have been more people coming to Australia because life is though, and these people come from places in close proximity to wars. At this moment in time, I think it's really bad for them here if they want to work in low level jobs and don't have skills or qualifications. I think it's really because the jobs in factories that these people used to do are not around as much.\r\n\r\nPossible version: There has been increased migration to Australia due to poverty and war overseas. Traditionally, many new migrants work in unskilled employment in order to establish themselves. Currently, it appears that unskilled low wage workers have particularly suffered due to a decline in the available of unskilled employment.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nIn the same way that recipes or letters use a particular style and form of language, academic assignments usually follow a particular style. Here are some guidelines.\r\nBe concise and specific\r\nTo write in a precise way:\r\n\r\n \tuse specific examples to illustrate your points\r\n \tcut out as much dead wood as possible\r\n \task other people to read your work to look for any irrelevant or vague\r\n\r\nUse the terminology of your subject or discipline and be clear about what you are saying. Don\u2019t assume that a tutor will simplyknow what you mean. When you really know your subject you should be able to articulate the main ideas and explain the main terms to someone who hasn\u2019t studied in your area.\r\n\r\nTo build your subject vocabulary:\r\n\r\n \tkeep your own glossary (list) of subject words at the back of a folder\r\n \tdevelop a list of \u2018power\u2019 words, ones that say a lot succinctly: g. \u2018nocturnal\u2019 is a more precise word for \u2018is active at night\u2019\r\n \tuse a thesaurus and a subject-specific dictionary\r\n\r\nBe tentative\r\nAcademic writing is cautious in presenting findings. Most theories are open to some modification.\r\n\r\nTo indicate new and emerging research, use words or phrases such as:\r\n\r\n \t\u2026suggests that\r\n \tThere is a possibility that\u2026\r\n \tStudies indicate that\u2026\r\n \tIt would seem that\u2026\r\n\r\nFor knowledge that is more established, use:\r\n\r\n \t\u2026 it is probable\u2026\r\n \tthe majority of\u2026\r\n \tThere is a tendency for\u2026,\r\n \tRecent studies confirm\u2026\r\n\r\nFor example: Mahlab (1994) suggests that there are significant differences in communication.\r\nUse impersonal language\r\nYou are often asked to make judgements and include your own views on an issue. However, in most subject areas you are required to avoid the pronoun \u2018I\u2019.\r\nThe fact that you are not reporting another person\u2019s view implies that the view is your own. In fact, whatever is included in youressay that is not attributed to someone else, [i.e. Jones (1987) demonstrates that\u2026, according to Smith (1994)...] is assumed to be yours.\r\nFor example, instead of saying \u2018I think that all guns should be banned\u2019 you can say \u2018strict government control of guns is required\u2019.\r\n\r\nUse formal language\r\nA university assignment requires a more formal type of language. Allow plenty of time to revise your expression after you have composed the main content.\r\nYou need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAvoid slang (e.g. \u2018cool\u2019) and language that is too casual (e.g. \u2018pretty awful\u2019).\r\n \tUse full forms rather than abbreviations, g. does not rather than doesn\u2019t.\r\n \tConsider the use of nominalisation (making noun structures) g. \u2018comprehension is aided by repetition\u2019 rather than \u2018you can understand something better if it is repeated\u2019.\r\n\r\nBe careful: too much nominalisation can make your writing unnecessarily complex and tedious to read.\r\n\r\nUse strong reporting words\r\nWhen you use other people\u2019s research you can give it extra significance by using a more precise reporting word, e.g. \u2018Jacob (1998) concedes that the test is not 100% reliable.\u2019 is more powerful than \u2018Jacob says that...\u2019\r\nUseful reporting words include:\r\n\r\nclaim, describe, outline, examine, discuss, state, suggest, observe, identify, consider, assert, propose, contend, support, recommend, purport, dismiss, refute, dispute, contradict, disagree, concur, point out, show, confirm, demonstrate, attribute\u2026to, calculate, contend, argue, reveal, maintain\r\nNB: The more you read academic material, the faster you will pick up the appropriate academic style, and the more academic reporting words you will acquire.\r\n\r\nUse your own \u2018voice\u2019\r\nYour assignment should be in your own words to reflect your thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIf you rely too much on quotes from different sources, your assignment task may lack cohesion and unity of style.\r\n \tMake your own paraphrases and summaries of research using proper\r\n \tIf English is not your first language, ask someone to read your assignments before you submit them, but don\u2019t be afraid to use your own \u2018voice\u2019.\r\n","excerpt":"Students are frequently required to use academic style for their university assignments.

It may change like the variable, (both doubling) or it may change more, or less. Differentiation means finding the derivative of an expression.\r\nThis means you are finding a rate of change for a variable. It expresses the slope of the curve.\r\n\r\nThe derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. If you map the profit of a company over time, the derivative will tell you if the company is getting stronger, levelling off or heading backwards.\r\n\r\nReview these sections to learn about this field of mathematics\r\n\r\n \tD1 Limit of a function\r\nThe limit of a function means finding the value of a curve at a particular point. But what is that point? A value to many decimal places can be very long, to define a value that is very precise. The precise point can be infinitely small.We can only ask what the value of the curve is as we get closer to that point, from values above and from values below. That is what we mean by approaching the limit.\r\n \tD2 Gradients, tangents and derivatives\r\nA tangent is a line that touches a curve at only one point. Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point. (See also Functions and graphs)A derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.\r\n \tD3 Differentiation from first principles\r\nLearn how to take a derivative of a function using first principles. Using this method is the best way to understand the concepts around differentiation. Start here to really appreciate what you are doing when you differentiate, before you start differentiating using other methods in later modules.\r\n \tD4 Rules for differentiation\r\nLearn about the rules for differentiation and the different notations that are used. This section includes algebraic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric examples.\r\n \tD5 The chain rule\r\nHow do you differentiate a larger function that has components that are smaller functions? This module will show you how to package these functions and work them out separately, before plugging them into the Chain Rule formula.\r\n \tD6 The product rule\r\nWhat is the product rule? It is useful when you want to differentiate a function that comprises one function multiplied by another function.\r\n \tD7 Quotient ruleWhat is the quotient rule? The quotient rule is like the product rule but this time it is for one function that is divided by another (rather than multiplied).\r\nReview this section to learn how to differentiate using the quotient rule.\r\n \tD8 Maxima and minima\r\nHow do you find the maximum (highest) or minimum (lowest) value of a curve? The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent. If you go looking for the horizontal tangents (i.e. where the derivative = 0), you will be able to pinpoint the maxima or minima of a curve.\r\n \tD9 Curve sketching\r\nIf you find some key points of a function such as: maxima, minima, or turning points; x and y axis intercepts; and regions where the gradient is positive or negative, you can put together a sketch of a curve. Read this section to find examples of this being done.\r\n \tD10 Rates of change\r\nIf there is a relationship between two or more variables (like, area and radius of a circle (A = \u03c0r2 ), or pressure, volume and temperature of a gas), then there will also be a relationship between how these variables change. You may need to find how fast one variable changes in relation to another variable that is changing. This is called the rate of change.\r\nThis page presents such examples to help you turn a worded question into a mathematical solution.\r\n \tD11 Small changes and approximations\r\nSometimes a small change in one variable can render a big change in a larger value. For example, a small increase (or error) in the radius of a sphere means a lot more volume is added!\r\nIf you estimate the small error in one variable, you can calculate the significant change in a larger variable by using derivatives.\r\n \tD12 Implicit differentiation\r\nWhat is implicit differentiation? How do you differentiate a function (say y=) that has two different variables in it (say x and k)? What do you do when you cannot express one as a function of the other? The technique of implicit differentiation is then useful.Implicit differentiation enables you to find the derivative of y with respect to x without having to solve the original equation for y (see also Rearranging formula). Implicit differentiation may require using the Chain rule and Product Rule together.Read this sheet for some worked examples and exercises in this process.\r\n \tD13 Partial differentiation\r\nWhat is partial differentiation? You may have an expression with 3 variables or more. The volume (V) of a cylinder for example depends on radius(r.) and height(h).It makes it easier to hold one value as constant and differentiate with respect to the other two. This helps us to see how the change in one impacts the change in the other, without being muddled by the third variable.Partial derivatives reveal how a function with many variables changes when you adjust just one of the variables in the input.\r\n \tD14 Higher order derivatives\r\nHigher derivatives are used in many mathematical, scientific and engineering subjects.\r\n \tD15 Logarithmic differentiation\r\nSometimes it is easier to differentiate the logarithm of a function than the original function. This is called logarithmic differentiation and this module provides an overview of the method and provides some examples.\r\n","excerpt":"The value of a function changes when one of the variables (x, y, a, or b etc) changes.

The location of this point is given by an ordered pair.\r\n \tFG1 Functions and relations\r\nA relation is a set of ordered pairs.\r\n \tFG2 Interval notation\r\nOften the domain of a function will be restricted to a subset of R. This subset is called an interval, and the end points are a and b.\r\n \tFG3 Inverse notation\r\nIf f-1(x) is the inverse function of a one-to-one function f(x) then f-1(x) is the set of ordered pairs obtained by interchanging the first and second elements in each ordered pair.\r\n \tFG4 Absolute value functions\r\nThe absolute value of a number x gives a measure of its size or magnitude regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

This module explains the equations and visuals of a linear graph.\r\n \tFG8 Quadratic graphs\r\nThe graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola.\r\n \tFG9 Graphs and transformations\r\nThe known graphs of some simple functions and relations can be used to sketch related, but more complicated functions.\r\n \tFG10 Graphs of sine and cosine functions\r\nBoth the functions y = sin x and y = cos x have a domain of R and a range of [-1,1]. The graphs of both functions have an amplitude of 1 and a period of 2\u03c0 radians.\r\n","excerpt":"Functions and graphs provide a way to represent, analyse, and understand relationships between different quantities.

Ancient builders and mariners used it for finding lengths that are not physically measurable (because they were so large) but they could be defined by angles.\r\nTrigonometry has applications in fields such as engineering, surveying, navigation, optics, electronics, aviation, and cosmology in finding distances between stars and planets.\r\n\r\n \tT1 Pythagoras\u2019 theorem\r\nPythagoras\u2019 theorem shows the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Knowing the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, the length of the third side can be calculated. This mathematical formula is fundamental for finding lengths and distances that are difficult to physically measure.\r\n \tT2 Right triangle trigonometry\r\nSine, cos and tan can be defined using side lengths of a right-angled triangle. These side lengths are identified as either the hypotenuse or the opposite or adjacent sides to the angle. This module shows how to apply trigonometric ratios to find a missing side length, or angle, in a right-angled triangle.\r\n \tT3 The sine rule\r\nHow can we apply trigonometry to triangles that do not possess a right-angle? The sine rule shows that the ratio of the length of a side, to the sine of its opposite angle, will be the same for all three sides.\r\n \tT4 Cosine rule\r\nThe cosine rule is a generalisation of Pythagoras\u2019 theorem. If you have any two sides of a triangle, as long as you know the angle between them, you can calculate the length of the third side.\r\n \tT5 Angular measurement and the unit circle\r\nAngles are frequently measured in degrees. However, it is sometimes useful to define angles in terms of the length around the unit circle (a circle of radius = 1). This module introduces radians as a measure of angle.\r\n \tT6 Circular functions\r\nHow do I make sense of trigonometric values for angles larger than 90 degrees? This page introduces you to the unit circle and how you can map these angles onto the unit circle to clearly understand their value and (+\/-) sign. See FG6 Circular functions\r\n \tT7 Trigonometric equations\r\nIf you know the value of a trigonometric function, how do I find all the possible angles that satisfy this expression? The calculator may only give you one answer to an inverse trig question between 0 and 90 degrees (say InvCos = 40\u00b0). The unit circle can help you visualise the many different solutions for finding your angle \u03b1.\r\n \tT8 Graphs of sine and cosine functions\r\nSine, cosine and tan functions can be graphed on x-y axes. Read this pdf to see how the amplitude (height) and period or frequency of these functions can be changed. See how the graph can be translated (shifted) along the horizontal or vertical axes.

Antidifferentiation (also called integration) is the opposite operation to differentiation. If you have the differentiation of a function, you can then obtain the original function via integration (antidifferentiation).\r\n \tIN2 Integration of polynomials\r\nHow do you integrate a polynomial where x is raised to a power?

But sections might also be below the axis (and therefore negative). Find out how to deal with finding the integral for sections of graph which go above and below the x-axis (horizontal axis).\r\n \tIN6 Integration by substitution\r\nAn expression that is composed of two functions (say an algebraic expression nested within a trigonometric expression) can be complicated to integrate. You can simplify this by substituting a single pronumeral (say u) to represent one of the functions. The substitution rule for integration is like the chain rule for differentiation: it breaks a complex expression into manageable parts.\r\n \tIN7 Integration using partial fractions\r\nHow do you integrate an expression when there is an algebraic expression in the numerator and denominator of a fraction? Integrating using partial fractions helps you to solve this problem.\r\n \tIN8 Integration by parts\r\nIf you can consider your expression to be a product (i.e. Multiplication x) of two functions, you can integrate this using Integration by parts. This reflects the product rule in differentiation and is applicable to logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and algebraic functions.\r\n \tIN9 Double integrals\r\nIntegrating will find the area between the curve and the x-axis (horizontal axis). We learned in IN4 Definite integrals how to limit this to a section of the x axis. But what if you have an area that is bounded by limits on both the x and the y axes? You will need to integrate with respect to the x axis and then integrate with respect to the y axis as well.Double Integrals is the method you will need. \u00a0There are linear, exponential and trigonometric functions defining boundaries for shapes on the x-y axes.\r\n","excerpt":"Integration is vital in engineering.

So, I thought I\u2019d better try and do something so I started preparing before a lecture or tutorial... things like I would read the textbook and look up new words ..and in this way I could understand and even be able to speak or ask a question. Usually I prepare for my lecture or tutorial by actually doing the readings and making up a couple of questions to ask so i know I always have something to say and I always make sure that I ask at least one question each time.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nWrite\r\n\r\n \tWrite down unfamiliar words and their meanings to develop your vocabulary.\r\n \tTake notes when you are studying and write summaries of the information.\r\n \tAdd to the blogs on Blackboard.\r\n \tResources:\r\n\r\n \tWriting skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nWell, at first I would try and read the text book and I couldn\u2019t understand anything there was so much new words new words ... it was terrible... so I started writing down new words but there were just too many .. but after a while I started to find that some words were used more than others and I realised that they were the more important words for that topic...and they were the ones I needed to remember.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nSpeak\r\n\r\n \tDiscuss your studies with others in English.\r\n \tContribute to class discussions.\r\n \tKnow what is going on in the world so you have something to say.\r\n \tResources:\r\n\r\n \tOral presentations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nAnother thing I found really useful is to study with others so you can discuss the course content and it helps you to understand the topic better and improve your English at the same time. I think one thing is very useful in building up my confidence was to sit in the front row of the class. In that way, not only could I hear and understand better but when I spoke I didn\u2019t feel so embarrassed because I didn\u2019t have everyone look at me.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nAsk\r\n\r\n \tAsk your tutor to repeat something if you don't understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nWhen I began my Uni I was so lost, and so\u2026 just so bad. As a first year student I didn\u2019t understand anything, in the lecture, in the tutorial I don\u2019t understand what the lecturer what the tutor was talking about and teaching about. It was a really hard time for me but I really wanted to get a good marks in this Uni because of as a first year student you know. But however when I receive the mark it was really bad and really low mark and I really unhappy and I asked the tutor what\u2019s going on because I think I put a lot of effort and I studied really hard to get on with the order assignment but the tutor explained to me that um the essay or the assignment, it was great, it was creative, but however my English was\u2026.really turned the marks down, turned the assignment down so it was a really hard time. Then he, then the tutor suggest me to go to the Language Support class in my free time. When I went there, the staff was really nice, really kind, and I, they provide me a lot of comment on my essay, on my assignment.

Because sometimes I know a lot of like overseas, like Asian countries they have accent like maybe in China or Hong Kong they have Chinese accents or Malaysia they have Malay accent so if you read the news it really helps you to correct or help you to improve your pronunciation and speaking skills.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that it is really helps to read the newspapers as well \u2026 this is because there is a lot of words in the news that you find all the time \u2026 even in text books ..so these words become familiar \u2026also some of the topics in the news are related to some of the work we study \u2026 it\u2019s also important to take notes of the key ideas- have a look at the note taking tutorial on the Learning Lab it\u2019s very useful.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nListen\r\n\r\n \tWatch English language TV, movies and listen to the radio everyday in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\n\u2026and I think that television, the telly, really helped me to improve my English as well. Like the listening or and maybe probably the listening and speaking probably. Because I remembered my home stay mother or my teacher suggest me to look at the news. Because sometimes they have the subtitles, I think when you have like the television you can choose subtitle and you will know what they\u2019re talking about. If you don\u2019t know you check your dictionary this kind of stuff. And yeah the telly really helped. I watched Big Brother because it\u2019s a really fun show.

So, but I think there is a really good way to improve your English like pronunciation this kind of stuff and so\u2026so of all things Umm I got a internship work, and also a part time job here in Australia. So I really recommend people to get a job working part time in Australia.\r\n\r\n[\/lightweight-accordion]\r\nStay motivated\r\nInternational students were asked how they managed to stay motivated and on task.\r\n\r\n \tHave a clear understanding about why you are studying for your course.\r\n \tRemind yourself of your long and short term goals.\r\n \tFocus on improvements rather than problems.\r\n \tMake big things manageable by breaking them into smaller parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[lightweight-accordion title=\"Transcript\"]\r\n\r\nDale Yeoh: Take it a step at a time. That was the key really, because it\u2019s about setting small objectives for yourself so that you reach your final goal. And the moment I started doing that, that\u2019s when things started to unfold a lot better for me. Even things like telling yourself to learn one word every day, or maybe asking more questions, telling yourself during tutorial today I\u2019m going to ask two questions. Simple things like that, setting these mini objectives really seemed to help.\r\n\r\nJyethe Wong: When I got my first assignment I kind of panicked \u2026 it was such a huge assignment I had no idea how to tackle it \u2026One thing I found pretty useful was something one of my friends told me\u2026 you work out how many words you will need to write for each section \u2026 like my first assignment was an essay that was 2000 words which I found really, really difficult. I looked carefully at the question and I worked out how many parts that I would need and how many words I would need for each part.

I made an appointment with my tutor and it was great\u2026. he explained that I didn\u2019t understood the question properly and it was also helpful to know that I wasn\u2019t the only one who found the assignment hard ... actually my tutor told me that the assignment was designed to show them who might need help and to show us what standard of work we should be doing \u2026. my tutor told me that I should always ask if there is anything I don\u2019t understand about an assignment \u2026.. I felt much better after talking to him\u2026 Instead of wanting to give up I felt more confident to do the next assignment.\r\n\r\nJyethe Wong : I also found it helped me to talk to other students about how they were getting on \u2026 it made me realise that everyone sometimes found things a little bit difficult. Sharing information with your friends or just talking in general about our studies was really, really helpful.

If you're not sure, start with something small that you can do in a short amount of time like a week or a few days.\r\n\r\nFor example: \"I will start and finish my literature review\" is not a good SMART goal because it is too general.\r\n\r\nA more achievable and SMART way to approach the assignment would be to divide it into small tasks and give each task a deadline. For example, you might set the goal of reading and summarising three articles by the end of the day. This goal is very specific, it's limited to a short time period, it's attainable, it's relevant to your assignment and you can clearly identify at the end the day whether you have been successful.\r\n\r\nThen, once you have completed this task, you will feel that you have achieved something and you can start your next attainable task feeling confident that you will be able to get it done.\r\nPriorities\r\nThere are a number of techniques that can be used to prioritise tasks- this section will focus on the Eisenhower Matrix. This is a model used to the importance and urgency of tasks to help priorite when and how they should be completed.\r\nTo use the matrix, organise your tasks into four categories: \r\n\r\nurgent and important: Tasks like assignments due soon or exam preparation. These should be focused on first. \r\nimportant but NOT urgent: Long-term projects or ongoing study. Schedule regular time for these tasks to avoid last-minute stress.\r\nurgent but NOT important: These include Interruptions like phone calls or messages that aren't critical and responding to non-essential emails. Limit time spent on these and fit them around more important tasks.\r\nneither urgent nor important: Activities such as scrolling social media, watching movies and playing video games. Minimise or schedule these for downtime.\r\nActive learning\r\nThis short video explains what you need to become a successful and efficient learner. It covers concepts such as knowing your own learning style, what independent learning is, and gives you ideas and strategies on how to be successful in your studies.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/shq02Vd77-c\"][transcript]Do you run out of time when you are studying?

This doesn't just happen in SWOTVAC, it is a process that begins early in the semester.\r\n\r\nYou need to have some learning strategies and develop some learning skills. You need to learn independently; you need to be proactive. This means finding answers to things you do not know, and being aware of what you do not know in the first place.\r\n\r\nYou need to be efficient, so that you are not going over and over the same material. You do this by using active learning strategies and knowing your learning style. This means understanding how you yourself learn best.\r\n\r\nOrganise your notes and you to-do list into categories. A long, long list is scary, and the most important things can get lost. Sorting things into groups is the brain's natural way of remembering.\r\n\r\nAnother tip is to use active learning strategies. Reading and listening is okay, but you will only remember 20 to 30 per cent of the information. It tends to go in one ear and out the other. Writing, speaking, and even teaching a concept to someone else is much more effective. So, by all means, chat with classmates about the material, take notes, and make your own summaries. These are all active learning strategies.\r\n\r\nIt also helps to know your own learning style, so you can use strategies that suit you. If your learning style is visual, you should try drawing stuff to understand and remember things. Some people learn best by doing, so hands on activities help them to learn. Explaining things to others really helps [auditory learners] absorb information themselves.\r\n\r\nThe most important strategy, of course, is to take charge yourself, because no one's going to do it for you. There is support there if you need it, but you will need to seek that help yourself. Your lecturers, the website, the Learning Lab, the Study and Learning Centre, and the library are all there to help you achieve your best, but when it comes to your study, you are now the boss.[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Check out these tips for managing your time and keeping on track with your assessments.

One method for keeping on top of your homework, assignments, and exam study is to use a planner. At RMIT, free semester planners are available at the Study and Learning Centre.\r\n\r\nTo use your planner effectively, it\u2019s a good idea to write down important dates, such as assignment deadlines, milestones, and dates of tests and quizzes. Another method is to use your student diary to plan your study. Or, if you prefer, the RMIT Learning Lab offers a weekly study timetable that you can fill out online and then print.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself not getting much done during study sessions, try setting yourself goals. Break down an assignment into small, achievable tasks, and each time you complete a goal, reward yourself. A 3000-word essay can seem a bit overwhelming at first. But if you break down the assignment into small goals during your study sessions, such as \u201cWrite 500 words\u201d, or \u201cWrite introduction\u201d, this makes the assignment much more manageable.\r\n\r\nRemember, focus first on the assignments that are worth the most marks. Have a look at the subject\u2019s course guide for a breakdown of assessment marks.\r\n\r\nGoogle Calendar is another good tool to use to stay on top of your studies. You can add important dates and set yourself reminders. This way, you\u2019ll receive automatic notifications on all of your devices. Download the RMIT \u201cImportant Dates\u201d calendar, which imports important dates such as week numbers, census dates, graduation dates, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor more information about time management, try the tutorial. Thanks for watching.[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\n\r\nTime management tools\r\nBy structuring your study time on a semester, weekly and daily basis you will gain control over your time and avoid the distraction of unimportant activities. To successfully organise your time you need to work out how much time is available and how you can best use this time. There are several useful techniques that will help you plan your time.\r\nAssignment Planner\r\nThe RMIT Library has a great assignment planning tool that is easy to use and provides you with step-by-step plan, withs links to lots of resources to help you stay on task.\r\nOnline calendars\r\nOne tool available to RMIT students is the Microsoft Outlook calendar. This online calendar can help you organise both your day-to-day activities and your entire semester.\r\n\r\nMap Out Your Semester: With the Outlook Calendar, you can easily input all your assignment due dates and exam schedules. The calendar can be viewed by month, week, or day, allowing you to see both the big picture and the finer details.\r\n\r\nPlan Your Days:\u00a0Use the daily view to schedule your study sessions, classes, and personal commitments. This helps ensure that you allocate enough time for each task and avoid last-minute cramming.\r\n\r\nSet Reminders:\u00a0Customise your reminder settings to receive notifications well in advance of deadlines. You can set reminders to alert you a month, a week, or just 15 minutes before a task is due, helping you stay on top of your responsibilities.\r\n\r\nCollaborate with Classmates:\u00a0For group assignments, you can share your calendar with your classmates. This feature makes it easy to coordinate meeting times and ensure everyone is on the same page.","excerpt":"Time management is an important skill needed for both your daily life and to manage your study.

The following strategies can help make a talk more interesting.\r\n\r\nVoice techniques\r\nYour presentation should contain the rise and fall of oral speech rather than the monotonous drone of reading out loud. Speakers use voice techniques to emphasise the introduction of new and important ideas.\r\n\r\nThe main techniques used are:\r\n\r\n \tword stress (words spoken more slowly and loudly). During the presentation you need to speak clearly and try not to talk too fast. When you are nervous you tend to talk faster than usual. In fact, speaking slowly alleviates nerves and gives you time to collect your thoughts.\r\n \tTone and pitch (the rise and fall of the speech). Vary the stress, volume and tone.\r\n \tSpeed\/pace remember to slow down the speed of your speaking - slower speech alleviates nervousness.\r\n\r\nObserve how Christine uses voice techniques to emphasise the introduction of new and important\u00a0ideas.\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IPnX76yH6sI\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nWith the launch of the Learning Lab, I'm sure that the skills learnt will provide students with good, solid learning skills that will assist them in performing to their full potential in all their courses.\r\n\r\nVoice techniques: Word stress.\r\n\r\n[\/transcript][\/ll-video]\r\nUse of visuals\r\nVisual aids can add another dimension to an oral presentation and strengthen the listeners' comprehension.\r\n\r\nMake your talk interesting by using well designed, colourful and self explanatory visuals such as:\r\n\r\n \tpictures\r\n \tdiagrams\r\n \tcharts\r\n \tgraphs.\r\n\r\nNotice how Christine:\r\n\r\n \tvaries her voice for emphasis\r\n \tuses facial expressions to involve the audience\r\n \tuses gestures and movements to add to the meaning of her talk\r\n \tuses eye contact to keep the audience interested\r\n \tuses visual aids to add to her talk.\r\n\r\n[ll-video url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/70uBKL7NyYs\"]\r\n\r\n[transcript]\r\n\r\nThis website consists of six links.

I know for a fact that many students perceive exams as a big memory test-cramming everything in the week before the exam.
