Removing the common factors allows us to factorise algebraic expressions and write them in a simpler form. Factorisation using common factors is a basic skill in mathematics so we'll discuss that too.\r\n A3.2 Perfect squares\r\nA perfect square is something like \\(5^{2}, x^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\). In this module we deal with perfect squares of the form: \\(\\left(x\\pm y\\right)^{2} =x^{2}\\pm2xy+y^{2}.\\)These forms are very common in mathematics and help us simplify expressions. They are important to know if you are an engineering or science student.\r\n \tA3.3 Difference of two squares\r\nIntroducing the difference of two squares formula which allows us to factorise expressions like \\(a^2 - b^2\\) or \\(x^2-36\\).\r\n \tA3.4 Quadratics\r\nQuadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\).

This is a general method that allows any quadratic to be factorised. For example \\[x^2+8x-5 = \\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right).\\]\r\n \tA3.6 Polynomial long division\r\nYou may have learnt long division in school. It enables you to divide two numbers that may be quite large. It is also possible to use long division on polynomials so that they can be factorised. Cubic polynomials are the most common. Find out how to write \\[x^3-5x^2-2x+24=\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right).\\] This type of factorisation is useful for graphing the cubic polynomial.","excerpt":"This section covers common factors, perfect squares, difference of two squares, and quadratics.

In many courses you will be required to use formulae to calculate something of interest. The process of substituting numbers for pro-numerals in an expression or formula is called substitution.\r\n\r\nRemoving brackets\r\nWhat do I do with the brackets? Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic fractions: Addition and subtraction\r\nHow do I deal with fractions involving pronumerals? Adding and subtracting fractions always requires a common denominator (which is the lower half of the fraction). These need to be the same before you can add or subtract. This means converting some of the fractions to forms that are consistent in the denominators. It is possible to do this even when the fractions include pronumerals.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic fractions: Multiplication and division\r\nWhat is an algebraic fraction? The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n\r\nQuadratics\r\nLet's take a look at algebraic fractions where the denominator is a quadratic expression. Such fractions are common in mathematics and engineering.\r\n\r\nPartial fractions\r\nFind out how to express an algebraic fraction as a sum of simpler algebraic fractions (partial fractions). The method of partial fractions involves breaking up an algebraic fraction into simpler parts that are added together. This is useful in integration and in finding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms.","excerpt":"This section covers essential algebraic skills: basic operations, substitution, handling brackets, and algebraic fractions.

An example url: https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/landing\/assessments.png\r\n \tEach image has a margin of 40px applied top and bottom\r\n \tThe default max width for images is 640px\r\n \tImages are aligned to the left by default\r\n \tAlt tags should be no longer than 100 characters\r\n\r\n\r\nImage options\r\n\r\n \tUse border=\"true\" to add a border. This can be useful for diagram images on a white background.\r\n \tUse align=\"center\" or align=\"centre\" to centre the image.\r\n \tUse shadow=\"true\" to add a drop shadow. Use sparingly.\r\n \tUse rounded=\"true\" to add rounded corners. Use sparingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe example above could use more padding around the content to support a border and the rounded corners.\r\n\r\n\r\nSizing\r\nBy default the max-width is set to 640px.\r\n\r\nA range of attributes can override this max-width value:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttribute\r\nmax-width\r\nSuggested use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"wide\"\r\n100%\r\nVery wide images that aren\u2019t too tall\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"md\"\r\n400px\r\nPortrait and square images\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"sm\"\r\n296px\r\nReally tall portrait images\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptions and transcripts\r\nCaptions can provide context for the use of an image and provide a place to attribute and credit the source of an image. A caption can be added using caption=\"Insert caption here\". Simple hmtl markup can be used within the caption. Elements such as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; can help with basic formatting.\r\n\r\nTranscripts are a way to provide an accessible alternative to an image, where a longer description is required that can be provided by an alt tag. To add a transcript, place a &lbrack;transcript&rbrack; shortcode in between the &lbrack;ll-image&rbrack; shortcode. Find out more information about the transcript shortcode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloating images\r\nFloating images help wrap text around them, maximising screen space. Ensure there's more paragraph text than the height of the image at a screen size of 1400px wide. If this works, the wrap will be effective at other screen sizes too. \r\n\r\n    By default, Floated content has a width of 296px. \r\n    On smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the image is displayed at full width.\r\n    Image should be placed before supporting content\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the float=true attribute. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien cursus ac.\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\nOther float options\r\nBy default, on smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the image is displayed at full width. To alter this, there are two options:\r\n\r\nAdd hide-sm=\"true\" to the shortcode. This is only useful if the image is purely decorative.\r\nAdd size=\"sm\" to the shortcode. This reduces the width of the image to 160px and maintains the float across all screen sizes.\r\n\r\nResize your screen to see this behaviour in action on the following examples\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the size=\"sm\" attribute to reduce the size of the floated image. If you resize your browser window, the floated image remains even at smaller sizes. \r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the hide-sm=\"true\" attribute. Reduce the width of your browser window to see the image hide at screen &lt; 768px wide.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien cursus ac.\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPortrait image\r\nWhen using a portrait, the default width of 640px might make the image too tall. You can use portrait=\"true\" to both limit the width to 400px and place the caption to the right of the image. This caption uses html code like as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; to do basic formatting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing portrait=\"true\" in conjunction with size=\"sm\" further limits the width to 296px. This is useful for really tall images. Note that other size parameters and centring do not work with portrait=\"true\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The image shortcode &lbrack;ll-image&rbrack;, allows you to put an image onto a Learning lab page.

Conditional language is very useful in case studies, especially when giving advice on possible or probable solutions to legal problems. A conditional is a two part sentence, e.g. if this happens, then that may happen.\nCommon conditional terms\n #terms li{margin: 5px 0} \n\n \tUnless and except\n \tIf clauses mean on the condition that. It is a two part sentence; an if usually followed by a then.\n\n \te.g. 'If the damage was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant, then liability will flow. If proper warning signs had been erected by the council... [then]...Brooke's injury would not have occurred.'\n\n\n \tproviding\n \tprovided that (on the understanding that)\n \twhether (if)\n\n \te.g. 'The question to be asked is whether a reasonable person would foresee that damage might result from the defendants action.'\n\n\n \tIt could be argued...

Introduces sentence\/s expressing probability.\n\n\nActivity\nSelect the conditional words or phrases to complete the text.\n\nIn the tort of negligence, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care, breached that duty and that damages were suffered as a result of a breach of that duty.\nFor Brooke to make a successful claim against the Yarra Valley City Council she \n\n establish that a duty of care existed. Here the test of reasonable foreseeability \n\n applied. The question to be asked is \n\n a reasonable person \n\n foresee that damage \n\n result from the defendant's action. It \n\n argued in Brooke's case that the signs put up by the Council created a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury of some kind to someone such as herself (See Chapman v Hearse 1961).\n\n\nCheck AnswersShow AnswersClear\n .color1{color: #104880!important;} .color1-b{border: 1px solid #104880 !important} .color1-h{background-color: #DDF5FD!important;} .color2, .correct{color: #134D13!important;} .color2-b, .correct{border: 1px solid #134D13 !important} .color2-h, .correct{background-color: #CCE7DF!important;} .color4, .incorrect{color: #D50000!important;} .color4-b, .incorrect{border: 1px solid #D50000 !important} .color4-h, .incorrect{background-color: #FBE6E6!important;} .color3{color: #F66000!important;} .color3-b{border: 1px solid #F66000!important} .color3-h{background-color: #FFF3DE!important;} .color5{color: #591E77!important;} .color5-b{border: 1px solid #591E77!important} .color5-h{background-color: #DFDBFE!important;} .color6{color: #4D4D4D!important;} .color6-b{border: 1px solid #4D4D4D!important} .color6-h{background-color: #E6E6E6!important;} .color7{color: #FDB000!important;} .color7-b{border: 1px solid #FDB000!important} .color7-h{background-color: #FFFADA!important;} .activity-container select{transition: all .3s} .first-cap:first-letter{text-transform: uppercase} \/* .first-cap{text-transform:capitalize}*\/ \/* .first-cap {text-transform:capitalize}*\/  String.prototype.firstCap = function() { return this.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.slice(1); } var options = [\"must\",\"would\",\"might\",\"must be\",\"could be\",\"whether\"] var updateOptions = function(){ jQuery('.activity-container select').each(function(){ var selected = jQuery(this).val() var html = \"-\" if(selected!='-')html+=\"\"+selected+\"\"; for(var i=0;i","excerpt":"This language section outlines the use of modal and conditional language.

Sample essay Introduction Wolfgang Weingart's cover designs for TM demonstrated his objection to the perceived conservatism and design limitations inherent in Swiss Typographic style, reflecting broader, international politico-social unrest. His experimental media combinations and playful subjectivity &hellip; inspired the next generation of designers to create a post-modern aesthetic. [Keywords and concepts] Weingart's philosophy of design practice calls for a commitment to the act of design, to focus on design as an iterative process of experimentation, prototyping and continuous refinement. [End keywords and concepts] Describe Between 1972 and 1973, Weingart created fifteen historically significant covers for Typografische Monatsblatter magazine which [Keywords and concepts] introduced a new paradigm to design [End keywords and concepts] (Heller 2004) &hellip; &hellip; [Keywords and concepts] His experimentation was criticised but respected [End keywords and concepts] because 'maybe you need to break things to create something new' (Schmid cited in TM RSI SGM 1960-902011, para. 100). Contextualise Paragraph 1: [Keywords and concepts] Post World War II, [End keywords and concepts] the increase in international trade, coupled with the growing speed and pace of communication, meant that the need for communicative clarity, multilingual formats, and universally comprehensible pictographs and glyphs became important (Meggs &amp; Alston 2011) &hellip; &hellip; This new clarity and minimalist design was effective in helping [Keywords and concepts] satisfy the communication needs of a world in an era of immense change [End keywords and concepts] (Meggs &amp; Alston 2011). Paragraph 2: [Keywords and concepts] By 1968, [End keywords and concepts] demand for changes in social relationships, the emancipation and politicisation of women and minorities, and increasing urbanisation contributed to [Keywords and concepts] a global expectation of rebellion, particularly against the social conservatism of the preceding decades [End keywords and concepts] &hellip; &hellip; The increasing awareness of global complexity and social turmoil encouraged experimentalism and a move away from anonymity to individualism in design. Analyse Paragraph 1: Weingart believed that for a designer to truly realise their personal typographic ideas, they must first [Keywords and concepts] explore all potential design paths via experimentation [End keywords and concepts] &hellip; &hellip; The inclusion of graphic design [Keywords and concepts] introduced new, expressive elements to typography. [End keywords and concepts] Paragraph 2: Weingart declared that these [Keywords and concepts] more aware and expressive attitudes in design [End keywords and concepts] were, 'accelerated by the social unrest of our generation' (Muller cited in Burton 2013, para. 8) &hellip; &hellip; Weingart's teaching philosophy permitted and encouraged his students to take these concepts further. Conclusion [Keywords and concepts] Wolfgang Weingart's critical questioning of assumed principles of design remains an important element of a designer's philosophy of practice today. [End keywords and concepts] As a designer, Weingart has had his work applauded for its break from the conservatism of the International style and celebrated for its individualism. Yet his focus on experimentation and embrace of technology did not distract from his belief that a designer must understand the basic principles of design practice and graphic techniques to underpin their personal practice &hellip; [\/tab] [tab title=\"Organic structure\"] In the example paragraph below, each new point relates either directly to the last part of the previous point, or back to the main idea.

However, to do so, typographers needed to understand basic design principles and processes to find solutions to design problems (Heller 2005;Kelley 2015;Schemer-Schebbin 1991).  &times;Heller, S 2005, Wolfgang Weingart: making the young generation nuts, AIGA - the professional association for design, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.aiga.org\/wolfgang-weingart-making-the-young-generation-nuts\/&gt;. Paras 8-11 Heller: What has been significantly gained or lost with digital-based typography? Weingart: You can compose micro-typography much better than in hot metal types. But you still have to know the existing rules exactly, even the ones from hundred years ago. Heller: Twenty years ago in Design Quarterly, your principles of typography were published &hellip; Have these principles changed for you in any way since that first publication? Weingart: That Design Quarterly in 1985 was one of the statements I've made about my activities in typography. Since the late sixties, you will find I radically changed many things, yet the principles are the same.   &times;Kelley, G 2015, Wolfgang Weingart, GregoryKelley, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www2.palomar.edu\/users\/gkelley\/Weingart.html&gt;. Paras 1, 3-4 In his work, Weingart demonstrates his mastery of typographic rules and the meaning achieved in breaking them &hellip; His vision was to breathe new life into the teaching of typography by re-examining the assumed principles of its practice. The only way Weingart was able to break the rules of typography was to know them ...Weingart's success &hellip; as a designer stems from both joy and judgment. His evident pleasure at discovering new possibilities &hellip; is matched only by his knowledge of the technical aspects of his craft. Weingart is an example of how knowledge and imagination can work together creatively.   &times;Schwemer-Schebbin, Y 1991, Reputations: Wolfgang Weingart, Summer edn., Eye, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.eyemagazine.com\/feature\/article\/reputations-wolfgang-weingart&gt;. Para 31 Weingart: For me technology is the ultimate challenge &hellip; But I'll never be completely under its control, because I know how to do things by hand, how to draw. If you know about only the technical side, you'll never produce a complete design. Para 34 Weingart: The PC represents the second big revolution &hellip; but to take full advantage of it you still require a thorough, basic classical training in design. People who haven't mastered the conventional graphic techniques won't be any better ...   Weingart's philosophy was that designers 'should be guided in developing their abilities to independently search for knowledge and personal values' (Weingart 1985, p. 16).  &times;Weingart, W 1985 'My typography instruction at the Basle school of design\/Switzerland, 1968 to 1985', Design Quarterly, no. 130, pp. 1-20, viewed 1 July 2015, JSTOR. Page 16 It is important for society that school be a place for experimentation. Students should not be given irrevocable truths or absolute values, but instead should be guided in developing their abilities to independently search for knowledge and personal values. Graphic design education at the Basle School of Design is characterized by a specific teaching approach &hellip; We teach students to explore constantly and to build upon new possibilities by creating differentiated design solutions &hellip; who, upon entering the profession, have a firm grasp of the design process - the ability to analyze, explore, conceptualize, recognize, apply and execute solutions to a vast range of design problems.  His teaching style at the Schule fur Gestaltung (Weingart 1985) was process-oriented, with a conscious focus on active, iterative design. He encouraged his students to continue this practice, to use whatever tools or technology were available to them to find new ways of creating images. Weingart's 1973 TM cover design for Issue 2 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.b) used Ruder's 'Grotesque' type design, but gave it movement and perspective, turning words into images. His 'idea was to teach more than typography...I had to bring graphic design &hellip; I created a bridge between typography and graphic design' (Weingart cited in Paradis 2011a, para. 126).  &times;Paradis, L 2011a, Interview with Wolfgang Weingart, TM RSI SGM 1960-90, viewed 1 July 2015, &lt;http:\/\/www.tm-research-archive.ch\/interviews\/wolfgang-weingart\/&gt;. Para. 126 LP: What about the new generation? Is there anyone? WW: Martin Woodtli, I didn't like his last work so much, but in general I like it. But the new generation is not mine. My idea was to teach more than only typography. Everybody thought typography was boring, stubborn, made your hands dirty. I had to change all these kind of negative feelings in many students. I had to bring graphic design. So I created a bridge between typography and graphic design. That was one of my so-called tricks.  The inclusion of graphic design introduced new, expressive elements to typography.

Example 1 By 1968, demand for changes ... contributed to a global expectation of rebellion ... socio-political tensions surrounding the Vietnam War emerged (Paradis et al. 2013). Weingart started using more organic and emotional shapes, such as the Issue 11, 1973 cover for TM (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c), where the typography is all but obscured by spaces which could be interpreted as bullet holes (Figure 1). The increasing awareness of global complexity and social turmoil encouraged experimentalism ...

Learn more about the way universities are structured and the types of study programs that are available, as well as the role of research at a university.\n\nOrganisation of university activities\nA university is generally led by the Vice-Chancellor and governed by the council and the academic board. Each university has their own values, policies, and legislation developed according to the national standards, which they obey and respect.\n\nUniversities are comprised of academic bodies and operational and strategic bodies. Academic bodies deliver the university's major teaching, learning and research services. Tertiary institutions have different names for academic bodies, which may include college, faculty, portfolio. These academic bodies are named and categorised based on the study program that they offer. A college or faculty generally comprises several schools or departments. All courses and programs are coordinated by the school, which is part of the college\/faculty. Students may not need to know which college or school they're part of, though it may help when they're engaging with university services.\n\nTertiary institutions facilitate teaching, learning, research, and community engagement across a wide range of disciplines. Teaching and learning are conducted via different levels of study programs offered to students via national and international university campuses and in some cases from a fully online service.\n\n\nStudy programs\nTertiary institutions offer a wide range of study programs ranging from vocational education and higher education to postgraduate education in many disciplines.\nPre-university study\nSome tertiary institutions provide pre-university study programs for domestic and international students to prepare them for tertiary studies or students who require extra support to get into a university-level program or who are keen to brush up their skills before starting at the university level. These programs may include:\nVocational study\nMany Australian universities offer a wide variety of vocational education or TAFE (technical and further education) programs, such as certificate programs, diplomas and advanced diplomas. Most of these programs help you to get into the degree of your interest such as associate degrees and bachelor degrees.\nUndergraduate study\nAssociate degrees, bachelor degrees and honours degrees offered by tertiary education institutes are considered undergraduate degrees. Most Australian universities offer undergraduate degree programs in STEM, business, law, education, social science, etc. Check out the web page of your chosen university for specific admission details.\nAssociate degrees\nAssociate degrees are two-year programs that combine both theoretical and practical knowledge, with a significant focus on work-based learning. This is a stand-alone qualification to enter the workforce as well as a pathway to enter a relevant bachelor degree. Universities offer associate degrees in many areas of study, including applied science, engineering science, graphic design, professional writing and editing, health sciences, screen and media production and more.\nBachelor degrees\nBachelor degrees are usually three-year study programs with a focus on both theory and practice. However, some professional degrees can take up to four or five years, depending on the study discipline. These degrees are open to both domestic and international students.\nHonours degree\nThe honours degree is a one-year specialised study that is generally undertaken upon the completion of the bachelor degree. Typically, students are required to have a high GPA from a bachelor to enter an honours degree. With an honours degree, you specialise in a specific area of your discipline. This degree is comprised of a larger portion of research or placement and coursework components. Honours degrees generally prepare you for masters by research or doctoral degree. You can undertake an honours degree in a different university than your bachelor degree. However, entry requirements can vary in different universities.\n\n\nPostgraduate studies by coursework\nA postgraduate program is generally any study that you undertake upon completion of your bachelor degree. Occasionally with extensive industry experience, you might be eligible to undertake a postgraduate program without a bachelor degree. Many tertiary education institutes offer different levels of postgraduate programs: graduate certificates, graduate diplomas and masters. In some cases, graduate certificates and diplomas can provide a pathway to enter a masters degree.\nResearch degrees\nResearch degrees are master and doctoral degrees across many disciplines. These programs are comprehensive research conducted independently under the guidance of an expert academic, which is called a supervisor. You can conduct research as a thesis model or project model, depending on the discipline of study. Masters by research degrees are two years of full-time work, and PhDs are four years of full-time work.\nOnline courses\nSome universities offer fully online short courses, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in many study areas. The core study areas include artificial intelligence, design, marketing, business and finance, health, science and engineering, data analytics and information technology.\nRecognised prior learning\nRecognised prior learning (also known as Credit) is the recognition of previous study or learning that can be counted towards a current program.\n\nThis can reduce the number of units (courses) needed to complete your program, which means the length and cost of your studies are reduced and you don't need to spend time learning things you already know.\n\nYou can use a variety of documentation to apply for RPL such as records of completed training or a letter from an employer.\nResearch\nResearch and innovation are a major part of an university culture. Research conducted at a tertiary education level is primarily focused on solving problems encountered nationally and globally in industry, government and community by applying new knowledge and innovation. Researchers in a university collaborate with the industry, government, business sector, hospitals, various research and academic institutions nationally and internationally to conduct impactful research. A university has some staff entirely dedicated to research. Research-focused staff include higher degrees by research students, research assistants, postdoctoral researchers, senior research fellows and research team leaders. Most lecturers also conduct research together with their teaching role. Your lecturer might be a researcher as well.\n\n\nImages by kiattisak, .shock and Monkey Business on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"Navigating any space is easier when you understand how it's organised.

While secondary school does some of the work to prepare you for the world of work and study, higher education expects more of you.  Habits, good and bad A habit is a tendency of your behaviour that repeats until it starts to happen automatically. Good habits take some time to form and might be difficult at first, until we do them daily without thinking. Many of the study habits you form at university will develop in the same way, but they will support you through the rest of your life so it's never too early to explore ways of working that suit you. You'll have a range of class and assessment types, and teaching styles also vary. It's worth keeping an open mind that one way of studying may not suit all classes and assessment types. Self-direction, doing it yourself A key factor in being a success in your studies will be your ability to be self-directed. You may not have immediate access to teachers to answer questions, or there may be a shortage of support services when you need them most. Assessment periods at your institution often mean that everyone needs help at the same time. Organising your time, developing good habits early and having a 'Plan B' for some of the challenges presented will ensure that you're ready for anything. Pulling it all together with a portfolio A portfolio is a collection of documents and pieces of work that best represent your achievements. It's a record of your academic accomplishments and progress, as well as professional development and reflections on your work. Your studies are intended to change you in ways that help you develop the skills and potential to be a success. This progress can be demonstrated by a compilation of your best assessments and related material and activities throughout your studies, providing evidence of your progression and success. Developing a portfolio like this can help you maintain confidence and can support your learning and capability post-study. After graduation, you may want to use it for seeking further study or employment. With all the varied types of activities you undertake as part of your study, there's a lot you can capture to tell the story of your skill development and ability.

How you work within different class sizes and in groups might impact your approach with your peers. Get prepared for collaborative learning with tips at Group work which will help you with completing class discussion activities or assessments when several students are contributing.  Learn with integrity In tertiary study you are expected to work with a high level of academic integrity. Academic integrity is defined as being when the \"wider academic community is built on shared values and norms of behaviour, including honesty, fairness and responsibility\" (La Trobe University 2023:para. 1). This integrity requirement applies to you as an active member of the academic community. You can demonstrate your knowledge and adherence to academic integrity rules by attending to and applying these points to your study:  be honest, fair and respectful in all academic activities, from completing your assignments to sitting exams employ good academic practice, whether you are working alone or with a group of classmates ensure your work, both individual and collaborative, acknowledges any information that has influenced your thinking. This includes everything from books and articles, to websites and images take personal responsibility for ensuring you act appropriately in your studies understand that these practices are applicable to the whole academic community, including students, staff and other professionals.  Learn more about academic integrity and RMIT policies around academic integrity. Referencing In tertiary study you'll learn how to acknowledge other people's ideas in your work by using referencing. You'll need to reference the source(s) both in your writing (in-text citation) and at the end of your writing (in a bibliography or reference list). Referencing styles vary from one discipline to another, so it's good to check with your teachers which style is used in your course. Visit Easy Cite for a list of referencing styles. If you don't have much experience with referencing, it's good to know that it takes time to master all the formats of your style &ndash; you don't need be an expert right away. Library staff are experts in referencing and can help you. Time management It's common to have commitments beyond studying, such as work, family, and social life, that require your time. It is good to keep in mind that if you do a full-time study load, it can equal a full-time job. It's important to manage your time in ways that can often prioritise your studies, amongst other things. There are things you can do to use your time wisely and keep the load moving.  Use time management tools such as Weekly Planner to control, allocate and keep track of your time to different commitments. Stay focused on your tasks by avoiding distractions such as screens and noise (if you need time to read and write). Avoid procrastination. You might think that you can work better under last-minute pressure. The reality is, it will get a lot more stressful when multiple study and work deadlines arrive at the same time. It's always better to plan and act early.  Learn more about time management.

Strong digital literacy skills facilitate better study, work and lifelong learning. These skills are valuable for a range of activities, including:   Learning and development Most of your course and support materials will be available online, usually accessed through a Learning Management System (LMS) like Canvas or Blackboard. The LMS will offer course materials, readings, video content, discussions, and manage your online assessment. Being comfortable in this online environment is critical to your success in your studies. You can use other educational websites such as simulations, learning activities, or the library website. You'll also use digital tools like videoconferencing and discussion boards to interact with your classmates and teachers.   Communication, collaboration and participation You'll participate in a variety of networks and platforms for work together with your peers. When working in groups, you could use project management tools and shared documents. To share information and participate in discussions, you might use social media platforms like wikis and blogs.   Digital creation, problem solving and innovation You can create digital resources including websites, images and video.    Information literacy The ability to find and evaluate information for relevance in a timely manner is important. Knowing when information is reliable, credible and suitable for assessments will improve the quality of your work. Navigating online resources such as databases with effective search strategies will help to locate credible information sources. This will enable you to produce better work and achieve higher marks. Methods to develop your information literacy When searching the web, it's important to think critically about what you're reading. Be careful about misinformation and baseless opinions. There are different methods for determining the quality and reliability of a resource. These include the SIFT and CRAAP methods. Consider one for your practice&mdash;they both offer helpful approaches to testing the integrity of information you find online.     SIFT The SIFT (Four Moves) method is great for investigating online content. Its steps include:  Stop Investigate the Source Find Better Coverage, and Trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.    CRAAP The CRAAP method is a checklist you can use to evaluate your source. It explains how you can determine its quality and appropriateness. The criteria includes:  Currency Relevance Accuracy Authority Purpose      Researching your assignment Information literacy is part of the research process. When looking for information for an assignment, applying these skills will mean that you can find more relevant and valuable information, and this can deepen your knowledge of the subject. Digital identity and wellbeing When you use social media, remember that your profile can be seen by many people, including future employers. The way that you interact, and the information you present online makes an impression. Be careful about how you engage with online networks, ensuring that anything you contribute is not discriminatory, defamatory or embarrassing. Ensure your privacy and security online with tactics to protect against threats like phishing1 and hacking2. Some of these include:  Strong passwords Two-factor authentication Not using public wifi Updating device and network security Using a VPN Not sharing personal information on email or other unsecured channels  It's also important that you manage your use of technology to prevent it from interfering with other activities or affecting your mental health. Overuse of social media, for instance, can lead to anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. Engaging with technology in a thoughtful and balanced manner can greatly reduce these harmful effects.

Learn how to design an effective poster presentation that balances text with graphics and helps your audience understand the main points of your work. What is a poster presentation? A poster presentation is a visual display, usually on a large poster board, that communicates the key points of a study, project, or topic. It often includes images, diagrams, flowcharts and other graphics, and bullet points are often used to highlight the main ideas. Poster presentations are common at conferences and other academic and professional events. While your poster might be presented to your peers with a short talk or discussion, the content and message of your poster need to be expressed clearly and concisely, in a way that is easy for your audience to understand without further explanation. Below are some tips to help you create an effective poster. Ideas for getting started   Read your assignment brief carefully It is always a good idea to have a clear understanding of the assessment criteria of your assignment. This way, you will know what the person who is marking your work will be using to grade your assignment. It is recommended that you read through the assignment instructions carefully and highlight keywords and keep these in mind throughout the planning phase of your assignment. You could use the criteria as a checklist when you have finished your draft, to ensure that you have covered everything that you needed to cover Also, check if there are any requirements regarding the dimensions, font sizes or layout of your poster because if these requirements are not met, this could lead to a lower grade.   Contact the library Don\u2019t know where to look for information? Get in touch with a Librarian through the Ask the Library chat service. They can help you find the best search terms to use, show you how to filter results, and help you identify which databases to use for your subject area.   Know your audience Think about who it is that you will present the information to. Are they professionals in your field? Are they members of the general public? Understanding your audience will help you to decide what content to include and the language you should use to communicate your work. Technical language and excessive jargon is not always appropriate for every assignment. Ensure that your message is clearly communicated to the target audience.   What to include This will depend on the purpose of your poster. For example, are you telling an audience about research that you conducted? You might decide that your audience needs to know why you conducted the research, how you did it, who participated in it, what the results were and what the implications of the results are. In this case, you might decide to follow a typical report structure of an introduction, methods, results, conclusion and discussion sections. For another type of project, you may need to include a literature review section or recommendations. And don\u2019t forget to include your references. If you are confused about how to structure your work, you can contact an Academic Skills Advisor through the Ask the Library service to get some feedback and advice. Design considerations Carefully consider the design of your poster, as this will affect how your audience engages with your information. Remember that you should include a mixture of writing and visual aids such as images, graphs, tables and charts. Layout Below are some points to consider for the layout of your poster:  Consider whether your poster would be best in landscape or portrait orientation. Your information should flow in a logical way, e.g., left to right, from the centre outwards, or in columns.  Make sure that your poster is not overcrowded. There should be space around each section, as this will increase the readability of your work. Include a border of 3cm around your poster.   Images Part of your message will be conveyed through images, so they should be chosen carefully. Keep in mind the following:  Images should be meaningful, not decorative.  Remember to add citations, attributions and captions to images. If you are not sure how to properly cite an image or include a caption, visit Easy Cite for guidance on a variety of referencing styles.  Do not use overly complicated graphs, charts or tables. Rather, aim to include graphic information that is clear and easy to understand.  Remember, you can't include everything in your poster. Choose the most important data, graphs, and images to include. You can expand upon your poster in an accompanying presentation.  Text  Include a title that stands out and catches your audience\u2019s attention. In physical settings, your title should be able to be read from 2-3 metres away. For font sizes, it is recommended that you use:  80-96 for titles 30-36 for headings 18-24 for body text  Other factors to consider are:  Where possible, use bullet points to make your text more concise and help your reader to focus on the main ideas of your poster. Choose your text and background colours carefully to ensure that your work is readable.  Use sans serif fonts, which are typefaces without decorative feet such as Arial or Calibri, as they are easier to read than serif fonts.  Do not use decorative or overly stylised fonts such as Comic Sans, as they are not considered academic.   Technology for creating your poster There are many apps and programs that can help you to design and create your poster. They include:  Microsoft PowerPoint Canva Adobe Illustrator Adobe InDesign Microsoft Publisher  They each have their pros and cons, so it is recommended that you try a few and see what works best for you. Some free software and apps are available for RMIT students. Once you have made your first successful poster presentation, especially if you receive good feedback for it, you can use it as a template for future presentations. Academic writing It is highly likely that your tutor or lecturer will request that you follow academic style conventions in your poster, such as avoiding personal pronouns and contractions, and using formal language. For help with academic style, you can make an appointment with an Academic Skills Advisor to review your work and get advice.

A successful paraphrase changes both the structure and words of the original text.\n\nParaphrasing\nIt usually isn\u2019t necessary, or desirable, to quote the exact words of another author. Instead, you can explain their work or ideas in your own words, and relate the information to the argument that you are developing. Expressing someone else\u2019s ideas in your own words is called paraphrasing.\n\nWhat is paraphrasing?\nThe goal of paraphrasing is to re-state information in your own words. A paraphrase is usually based on a small section of text, as opposed to a summary, which contains the main points of a larger work.\n\nA successful paraphrase keeps the original meaning of the source material, but uses different vocabulary and sentence structure to express that meaning. Paraphrasing can be a useful way of explaining complex information in simpler language. Sometimes this means that paraphrases are actually longer than the source material.\nHow to paraphrase successfully\nTo paraphrase a text, follow these steps:\n\n \tRead or listen to the text that you want to paraphrase and make sure you understand the main idea.\nExample of original (fictional) text\nAfter the cultural awareness intervention, the experimental group demonstrated growth in the target areas at a statistically significant level, while the control group showed no gains.\n\n \tWrite the idea from memory. Try switching the concepts around and start your explanation of the idea in a different place. You might imagine that you are trying to explain the idea to someone who didn\u2019t understand the original text.\nFirst paraphrase attempt\nWhile the students in the control group did not have any gains, students in the experimental group who experienced the cultural awareness intervention demonstrated significant improvements (Author 2023).\n\n \tIf you\u2019ve used too many words that are similar to the original text, replace these words with other words or phrases of similar meaning. A thesaurus or dictionary can help you, as can academic word lists that offer different word forms. A good goal is to aim for no more than 4 words in a row that are the same as in the original source.\nFinal paraphrase\nWhile the students in the control group of Author\u2019s (2023) study remained at the same levels of cultural awareness, those students who participated in the additional experimental classroom activities improved their cultural awareness by a large margin.\n\n \tCompare your language to the original text to make sure your version is different, but that you\u2019ve kept the original idea. Don\u2019t forget that you need to include a citation every time you paraphrase.\n\nAvoiding plagiarism\nIt is important to make sure you paraphrase correctly to avoid plagiarism. If you use a section of text from another source in your own work, and you only change a few words or move the sentences around, that is still considered plagiarism. A paraphrase needs to be significantly different in vocabulary and structure to the original text. Plagiarism-detection tools like Turnitin will flag text for plagiarism if it's too similar to another person\u2019s work, even if some of the words have been changed.\n\nNew artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, have the ability to paraphrase information, but words taken from ChatGPT also need to be properly referenced. The use of these tools is not always permitted, so be sure you understand the expectations of your course to avoid academic misconduct, and check with your instructor if you have any questions.\nPractice paraphrasing\nRead the text below, and then select the best paraphrase from the two options given.\n\n\n\nReferences\nLaudon KC and Laudon JP (2000) Management information systems: managing the digital firm, 6th edn, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.\n\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the RMIT Harvard referencing style. Check your course handbook or speak to your instructor about the referencing style required in your area of study.","excerpt":"Paraphrasing is when you express information, ideas, or work done by someone else in your own words.

Synthesising involves combining ideas from a range of sources in order to group together and present common ideas or positions on a topic. It\u2019s a necessary part of developing a sophisticated argument, and is used in many forms of academic communication. What is synthesising? Unlike summarising and paraphrasing, which only use ideas from one source at a time, synthesising combines ideas from multiple sources. Synthesising allows you to:  develop and strengthen your arguments with a variety of evidence show that you have read widely on the topic demonstrate analytical and critical thinking skills.  How to synthesise Use the following steps to synthesise information from different sources.  Read materials relevant to your topic, and make brief notes on the key points in each source that are connected to your argument. This makes it easier to compare and contrast information across different sources. Identify common ideas or themes in your notes. Use reporting words and linking words to explain common ideas, making sure to cite all the sources you have used.  Synthesis example The following example uses four fictional sources to show how you might take notes and then synthesise the ideas in a piece of writing. Note-taking for synthesis Read each source and take notes on the main ideas in dot point format.  Topic: English is the dominant world language   Text 1 (Watson 2019)   international language for business used for international forums (e.g.&nbsp;UN) second language in many countries      Text 2 (Lui 2018)   used in worldwide technology computers key factor in spread of English internationalisation of education      Text 3 (Hannan 2017)   small number of speakers worldwide importance of English linked to US power, i.e. 'Political' more people speak Chinese worldwide      Text 4 (Dowd 2019)   minority of speakers in world Chinese dominant especially in future English will decline in future     Writing a synthesis from notes Look at your notes to identify similar and contradictory arguments. Group these together to develop and support your arguments, and cite your sources appropriately.  Supporting the contention that English is the dominant world language, Watson (2019) and Lui (2018) point out its importance as the medium of international communication in business, technology and other global forums. However, others argue that despite its apparent dominance, English is not the global language when the number of native speakers of other languages, for example Chinese, are considered (Dowd 2019; Hannan 2017).

It is important for students, teachers, researchers and professional staff to act in an honest way, be responsible for their actions, and show fairness in every part of their work.

Play the video for a brief overview of academic integrity:  Understanding academic misconduct It is important to understand what academic misconduct is in order to avoid it. The four main forms of academic misconduct are:  Plagiarism &ndash; using someone else\u2019s work or ideas without giving them proper credit Ghostwriting and contract cheating &ndash; having someone else complete an assessment for you, or completing someone else\u2019s assessment Collusion &ndash; working with others to do an assessment that was meant to be completed individually Improper exam conduct &ndash; giving or receiving help during exams, including using prohibited technology or tools.  Academic integrity in Australia Academic integrity is taken very seriously in Australia, and there have even been people who have had their degrees withdrawn, after graduation, when they were found to have cheated. Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) is the federal government agency responsible for standards in tertiary education. TEQSA enforces regulations relating to universities, including academic integrity. In fact, contract cheating services&mdash;companies that charge students money to write their assessments for them&mdash;are illegal thanks to TEQSA. Not only is it illegal to take money to do someone else\u2019s assessments, it is illegal to buy an essay or other assignment from anyone. TEQSA has resources for students, and they also provide information in languages other than English. Students need to be aware of the requirements for their studies. This includes knowing what is considered cheating or colluding, and what is acceptable practice. When in doubt, your instructor can answer questions about what is expected in your course.

Learn more about the feedback provided by Turnitin. What is Turnitin? RMIT uses a plagiarism detection tool called Turnitin for all written material. Play the video to learn how Turnitin works:   When you submit your work to Turnitin, a similarity report will be generated. Your instructor will review this report to help them determine whether you have referenced everything correctly, or whether you might have plagiarised. You can also use this report to check your own references and make sure you haven't accidentally plagiarised. Understanding the similarity report The similarity report shows the amount of text that matches other texts, including websites, academic journals, and material previously uploaded to Turnitin. This may include work that you've submitted to RMIT in the past, as well as assignments from other institutions around the world. The similarity report will tell you the percentage of your text that matches other materials. The match overview section highlights portions of text that match or are very similar to sources already on Turnitin. How the text matches are spread out is more important than the percentage. If you have large chunks of text which are highlighted, this could mean that more careful paraphrasing is needed. In some cases, you can make changes and upload your work again to produce a new similarity report. Check your course guide on Canvas to see if you can do this. If there are small matches, look at these carefully. Correctly cited and formatted quotes may be highlighted, depending on the Turnitin settings. Additionally, items such as course titles, teacher names, and assignment titles may be highlighted in Turnitin. Reducing the similarity score These tips can help you reduce your similarity score:  If chunks of text are highlighted, then you need to paraphrase further as the wording is still too close to the original source. Check that your quotations have double quotation marks. Single marks will always be ignored by Turnitin. Check the settings. You can reduce the percentage immediately by excluding quotations and your reference list. Note that changing the settings does not impact what your instructor sees.

Each citation refers to a different source you are using in your work. It provides a couple of details about the source, and it points the audience to the reference list (sometimes called a bibliography) for further information. Depending on the referencing style you\u2019re using, citations can take different forms:  Parenthetical citations have information that appears between parentheses or brackets. Footnotes have two parts: a small number that appears above the text line, called a footnote number, and a note at the bottom of the page with more information. Endnotes have the same small numbers as footnotes, but the notes appear at the end of the document or section of writing.  Tips for inserting citations in written work Parenthetical citations can appear at the beginning or end of a quote, paraphrase, or summary. You can also have more than one citation in a sentence if you are synthesising the ideas from multiple sources. When citations are placed at the end of a sentence, they generally appear inside the sentence punctuation.  Examples  \". . .\" (Author 2022:62). According to Author (2022), . . .

Unlike parenthetical citations, footnote and endnote numbers are placed outside the sentence punctuation.  Examples  According to Author, . . .1 While Author proposed . . .,1 this idea was rejected by Researcher due to . . .2   Don\u2019t forget that in general, footnote numbers need corresponding footnotes at the bottom of each page, and endnote numbers need endnotes at the end of the document or section of writing.

Citations in presentations and multimedia work It is important to include citations in all of your work, including presentations and multimedia projects. When you are giving an oral presentation or creating a multimedia piece that references the ideas of others, make sure to incorporate the same information you would include in a written citation.

With each new week there seems to be a new tool that can write text, create images, or solve other problems. But what exactly is AI, and just what can it&mdash;and can it not&mdash;accomplish? What are artificial intelligence and AI tools? Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Its goal is to create computer programs or tools that can mimic human intelligence and complete tasks that generally require human skills. AI tools are helping with critical thinking and analysis tasks in many fields, such as medicine and engineering. Recently, many new tools have been released that can produce writing and create art, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and DALL-E, Google\u2019s Bard, and Adobe\u2019s Firefly.  Figure 1. Image generated using NightCafe from the prompt \"two students walking together on a university campus in the style of a post-impressionist painting\". How does an AI tool generate text? Tools that generate text are a type of AI called a \u2018large language model\u2019 (LLM). They have this name because they are large, very complex computer programs that are fed billions of words of text (a process called \u2018training\u2019) until they become good at understanding the patterns of language&mdash;not only grammatical patterns, but also which words and phrases are related to each other and how they tend to appear together in a text. When you ask one of these tools a question, it analyses your question and tries to answer you based on the patterns it knows. These generative-text tools are based on statistical models of language patterns, so as they write your answer, they are continually analysing probabilities to guess which word or phrase is most likely to appear next in a piece of clear and coherent writing. It\u2019s important to understand that LLMs are not search engines. While they can make it sound like they have all the answers because they\u2019re so good at writing convincing language, they don\u2019t actually \u2018know\u2019 anything. They are simply writing the most reasonable response based on probability. This is why they don\u2019t always provide accurate information, and why some tools are unable to provide sources for the ideas in their writing. How does an AI tool generate an image? Like generative-text tools, AI tools that create images based on a text description are trained on very large sets of data until they\u2019ve learned what patterns make an image look realistic\u2014for example, the usage of colour, texture and lighting, and the way objects are arranged\u2014as well as what text descriptions match different types of images.  Figure 2. Image generated using NightCafe from the prompt \"two students holding hands on a university campus in the style of a colour portrait\". Image generating tools can create art in different styles because of the large number of images they\u2019ve already analysed. Just like generative-text tools, they sometimes produce strange results because they do not understand anything about what the real world actually looks like\u2014they are simply mimicking the visual patterns of millions of other images. It should be noted that in many cases, artists have not been consulted before their work was used to train these tools, leading to ethical concerns. Can I use generative-AI tools to help with my assignments? It\u2019s important check with your instructor whether you\u2019re permitted to use AI tools when completing an assignment. Even if using AI tools is allowed, relying on them too much could mean that you don\u2019t learn the necessary skills of your course. And if you use AI tools when it isn\u2019t permitted, that would be a breach of academic integrity. Another important point is that many generative-text AI tools, such as the current version of ChatGPT, were not designed to provide sources. Because they are simply models of how language works, they have no concept of 'information' or where it might have come from.

A number of Learning Lab pages link to Learning Lab Contextualised Content (LLCC), an open educational resource that supports learners by offering realistic and relatable examples of how key knowledge and skills may be applied. What is the Learning Lab Contextualised Content resource? LLCC is a suite of online learning materials. Content is presented in an interactive, online format, and is free for educators to use, adapt and share. It covers a range of subjects like maths, physics, writing, nursing, and sustainability literacy, as well as interpersonal, organisational, higher-order thinking, and online learning skills. The content seeks to build study and career aspirations among learners and awareness of the value of developing foundational, transferable, and multi-disciplinary skills. It does this by presenting learners with content authentic to their lives and experiences, with a focus on industries like engineering, economics and marketing, and the health and social sectors. The LLCC materials support Learning Lab pages by offering realistic scenarios showing that the skills and knowledge in the tutorials can be practically applied in scenarios learners may encounter in their everyday lives. This reinforces the value of these skills and knowledge areas in the eyes of the learner and demonstrates how developing them will be beneficial in their education and\/or careers. How can educators use this resource? The LLCC is an open educational resource (OER). The Creative Commons license is CC BY-NC which means you can use it as is or adapt it to suit your needs, providing the purpose is non-commercial (the content is not being sold) and an attribution is included. The content can be shared or downloaded in various formats. For example, learners can be linked directly to the pages online, the content can be downloaded in a PDF format, or embedded into an LMS, such as Canvas. Under your guidance and direction, students can engage with learning objects to complement the lessons they are currently undertaking or fill skills or knowledge gaps in foundation areas. The content has been designed so that learners can engage with them independently, but it can be easily adapted to suit pair or group work. There are \u2018reflect\u2019 questions in many objects, which can serve as transitions into collaborative activities and larger discussions. One of the things that makes this content special is that although it has a story, and chapters like a book, it doesn't have to be approached in a linear fashion at all. You might want to include supplementary material on communication and collaboration skills in your course, but not subject skills like maths and physics or vice versa. That is not a problem with the LLCC as the pages are modular, meaning they are self-contained, and you can use specific pages without needing to navigate the entire resource. For more information on how educators can use the LLCC resource visit the Teacher\u2019s guide.

But anyone can share just about anything online. Before you repost or retweet, how can you be sure that what you\u2019re reading isn\u2019t fake news?\n\nThoughtful social media use\nWhen we see or hear information that aligns with a belief we already hold, we generally don\u2019t question it. Do you feel confident that a particular food, exercise, or supplement is full of health benefits? Then of course you\u2019re going to trust a tweet claiming that it reduces your risk of cancer. Similarly, if you think a certain political party is plagued by corruption, you\u2019re likely to believe a post saying one of their members was involved in a scandal.\n\n\n\nOur tendency to trust information that supports what we already believe, and to ignore other facts and evidence, is called confirmation bias. Combine confirmation bias with an inflammatory or provocative social media post, and misinformation can spread rapidly. It\u2019s always important to consider whether what you\u2019re reading and seeing is factual, especially if you\u2019re going to share it with your online community.\nThe SIFT method\nThe SIFT method is a set of four simple steps to help you determine whether something you are reading online is trustworthy.\n\nSIFT stands for\n\n \tStop\n \tInvestigate the source\n \tFind better coverage\n \tTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context.\n\nThese steps are all about understanding the source and context of the information, so that you can decide before you even read it whether it is valid and reliable.\n\n\n\n\nStop\n\nIt can be easy to get pulled into a post on social media or a provocative web site before doing any evaluation at all. This first step reminds you to pause and consider whether you know and trust the source of the information you\u2019re reading. If you have any doubts, continue with the next steps.\n\n\n\nInvestigate the source\n\nBefore you dig into an idea you find online, it\u2019s helpful to know where it\u2019s coming from. You\u2019d probably want to know if the claims you\u2019re reading about climate change are coming from a car manufacturer versus an environmental researcher, for example. If you\u2019re not familiar with a website, look it up on Wikipedia for an overview. Knowing the expertise, perspective and agenda of the source can help you to better analyse and interpret the information provided.\n\n\n\nFind better coverage\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to determine whether a claim is true or false, one of the best strategies is to find more information about the topic from trusted sources, a process called lateral reading. You can try to find the best, most authoritative source on a topic, or you can read multiple sources to see how different publications treat a claim you are trying to investigate.\n\n\n\nTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context\n\nSome people or organisations might not provide the whole picture of a topic, even if they are not intentionally trying to deceive you. Quotes can be taken out of context, claims distorted, and media altered or miscaptioned to support a particular perspective. Tracing these back to the original source allows you to see the original context and decide if the ideas have been presented accurately.\n\n\n\nApply your understanding\nHave a look at the content shared below and consider whether the information is factual and trustworthy.

Universities provide students with a variety of study, collaboration, social, recreational and creative spaces. The campus University campuses are vibrant places and can be crowded with people walking to various buildings and social spaces. The campus community is generally made up of students, teachers, professional staff, and visitors. Some of your learning may take place on campus where spaces are set up for a variety of different types of learning including:  lectures labs classrooms for tutorials media studios creative spaces study spaces the library common areas cafes  Wifi allows you to connect your PC, laptop, mobile phone or tablet device without using a cable. Wifi access points are across the campus, making everywhere a study space. University campuses provide recreational and social spaces for students such as sports facilities, like gyms, basketball courts and running tracks. Social events are held on campus for students to hang out with classmates and get to know their peers.  University libraries as community and cultural spaces University libraries are centrally located on campus where the university community can come together to meet, collaborate and build a sense of place. Libraries are often positioned near other services where you may seek information and advice, like the enrolment centre and student union. The library is a space where people can come together to share ideas, connect with one another, exchange knowledge, and work towards common goals. It's a great place to achieve success in your studies and take advantage of the opportunities that tertiary education offers. Libraries help build community in several ways. They offer study support through drop-ins or consultations, workshops and training, as well as cultural events like exhibitions and seminars. At the same time, libraries also provide a quiet environment for students to study on their own. Universities commonly have artistic and creative spaces such as art galleries, cinemas, and dance spaces. Some Libraries manage makerspaces, where students gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge. A makerspace is often equiped with 3D printers and laser cutters. Study spaces The space in which you work plays an important role in productivity as well as improving focus and efficiency. There will be times when you will need to use a designated study space on campus or at home for group work, individual study and listening to online lectures and presentations. When setting up a study space, it's a good idea to have all the materials you need within reach. That could be physical items like a notebook, pens, highlighters and course material like course notes, textbooks, calculator. When setting up a digital study space consider bookmarking study resources frequently used to improve organisation. It's also set up some folders for online documents for your courses. When working in a group space on campus, or at home, choose a space that will enable you and your group members to talk freely, exchange ideas and plan your work. Booking a group room on campus is one option and another is to arrange an online meeting with your group. When setting up an individual home study space, if possible, choose a space which allows you to control the lighting, sound, and temperature. Creating a comfortable environment with fewer distractions helps you concentrate. One of the advantages of working from home is that you can set up your study environment as you wish. Important things for a good study space are:  a dedicated desk a comfortable ergonomic chair access to power access to internet good lighting temperature &ndash; not too hot or cool.

However, all educators share a common goal: to help students succeed in their studies. Educators are academics and or professionals who help students gain and practice knowledge. The types of educators that you connect with can vary depending on your level of study, i.e. vocational education (VE), higher education (HE) or postgraduate. Academic When we talk about academics at a university, we could be referring to different types of educators. Some academics focus solely on research and don't do any teaching, while others do both teaching and research. An academic could be your tutor, lecturer, professor, or dean, who oversees an entire school within your college. However, academics are usually not found working in Vocational Education areas. Program coordinators\/program managers Program coordinators are responsible for the overall quality of a degree program or certificate program. If you have any questions about the courses you have selected for a particular year or want to swap courses or drop a course, the program coordinator would be your first point of contact to get advice. The main responsibilities of a program coordinator include:  developing short and long-term goals for the program scheduling courses, teaching teams and timetabling of the program working closely with course coordinators to organise off-campus programs such as internships, placements, study tours etc. managing program resources such as budgets, facilities, and types of equipment  Course coordinator Course coordinators are responsible for designing, planning and delivering a particular course within a degree\/certificate program. They are your first point of contact if you have any queries about the course such as learning materials, timetables, assessment dates, late submission for assessments etc. Some of the responsibilities of a course coordinator are:  working closely with the program manager and the department head to prepare course objectives leading the development of the learning materials, assessments and canvas site of the particular course leading the course teaching team organising textbooks and other resources for the course recruitment, training and management of the tutors for the particular course organising guest lectures or industry expert seminars  Lecturer\/VE Teacher The primary role of the lecturer is to facilitate the learning process, assess and mentor students according to the course curriculum. Lecturers are content experts in a specific discipline. Often your course coordinator and\/or program coordinator can also be one of the lecturers delivering the course. For VE educators, the primary term used is the teacher. The learning materials can be delivered in a classroom\/lecture theatre (face-to-face) or online (via Teams or Collaborate Ultra). When you have difficulties understanding course materials, you can always contact your lecturer and ask for further explanation. The main responsibilities of a lecturer\/VE teacher include:  delivery of quality education and training to the students engaging students in the learning process training for technical skills associated with the course, such as laboratory skills, computer skills etc. assessment preparation and marking  Guest lecturers and industry professionals Most university level courses offer lectures or seminars from guest lecturers or industry professionals, experts in their fields, as work-integrated learning. They share insights and experiences from their career as well as current knowledge in the industry or profession. An opportunity to learn from an expert in your profession is a highly valuable experience. These seminars provide an opportunity to ask questions about the industry or profession you will enter after your studies, as well as a networking platform.  Tutors Tutors are a vital part of a course-teaching team. They usually deliver tutorial sessions, workshops and lectorials with or without a lecturer. Tutors help you understand the tutorial questions, help you with complex concepts from the course material and provide feedback on your learning. If you are hesitant to ask questions from a lecturer, tutors will be your next option. Most importantly, they are more approachable during the class\/session. Most tutors in undergraduate and postgraduate courses are current PhD students. They are friendly, welcoming you with questions and supportive, as well as experts in the subject content. Librarians A Librarian is an information professional who supports learning, teaching and research. They provide training and support to connect the university community with the information and resources they need. They're available to support the university though various channels, including online or face to face one-on-one consultations, embedded workshops, and via online chat. Librarians are experts in information literacy, which is the ability to identify and evaluate reliable sources of information. It's a good idea to ask librarians for help because they can guide you to the best resources for your assignments. They can also assist you in developing research skills that will enhance your abilities to complete a variety of assessments and tasks during your studies. Academic skills advisors Academic skills advisors provide valuable advice and support across a range of subject areas and academic skills. This could include writing, assignment planning and structure, English language, presentation skills and more. Some are specialists in subject areas including science, maths and chemistry. They make themselves available through a variety of ways, including workshops and online\/face to face one-on-one consultations. If you need help with your course work, it could be to check your writing or solve a mathematical equation or to further explain a science concept, academic skills advisors are there to help you. Laboratory demonstrators \/ Technicians Laboratory demonstrators play a vital role in the delivery of practical-based classes. They have a good understanding of the theory as well as laboratory skills and techniques. Laboratory demonstrators teach and assist you with laboratory skills. They are friendly and available to answer student questions during the class, provide clear explanations combining theory and the practical aspect and provide feedback on your laboratory skills and laboratory-based written work. In VE, laboratory demonstrators are called technicians. Placement supervisors A Placement supervisor is a professional who works in a specific field and is assigned by the organization to guide, teach, and support students during their placement. They are usually willing to share knowledge, provide close guidance to develop professional practice skills and create a supportive environment to work. HDR supervisors Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students have completed a undergraduate degree and are continuing their studies through completing a postgraduate study. This may include a Masters' by research or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). The Higher Degree by Research (HDR) supervisory team guide, mentor, and support their students throughout the HDR candidature. The HDR supervisory team comprises a primary supervisor, co-supervisors and associate supervisors. The primary supervisor leads the supervisory team and is mainly responsible for the student's candidature. Also, they are responsible for the student's ongoing progress, arranging milestone panels, preparing the student for the milestone review, and ensuring the student has access to the required resources and the facilities to complete the study. Associate supervisors provide support with a particular area of the research. The primary supervisor is the main point of contact for students for any query.

You might have classes that meet both on campus and online, and you will likely engage with a variety of online resources.\n\nThe digital campus\nThe digital campus is a concept to help students and staff understand that not all learning takes place at the physical location where a tertiary institution operates. The tertiary community will have to work across the internet, online resources, digital learning environments and social platforms. The instituion where you're enrolled will aim to use these locations as well as the phsycial ones to best deliver a quality educational experience so you can develop the skills and knowledge to prepare you for work and life.\n\n\nBlended learning\nMany universities have transitioned to blended learning since the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic. The blended learning experience is a mix of online and face to face activities. Blended learning is flexible, accessible, inclusive and connected, supported by specialist spaces, services and technologies. The university isn't just a physical place, and much of your learning and connections will be undertaken online.\n\nDigital learning is a core part of every student's experience. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other kinds of learning materials that you can access through digital learning platforms as you learn at your own pace. Blended learning programmes may include a rich mixture of face-to-face and\/or online learning activities incorporating different media such as text, audio or visual media. This provides opportunities to explore different learning methods and activities.\n\nA typical example of a blended learning timetable usually means that your lecturers will create in-person classes in the physical classroom and combine them with online classes. A typical blended learning schedule would be something like:\n\nMonday: In person class\nTuesday: In-person class\nWednesday: Online class and activities\nThursday: In-person class\nFriday: Live Online class and activities\nThe flipped classroom\nIn a flipped classroom, students engage with the materials before or outside of the class. It's flipped because you have done the homework before rather than after the class. This gives you the opportunity to discuss the learning material you have explored, contextualise what you have learnt, and clarify any concepts with your teacher. This allows you to develop deeper knowledge through discussion and activities (Allan, 2016).\n\n\nConcurrent teaching\nConcurrent teaching is when a class is both face-to-face and online at the same time.

The right example or piece of evidence can help us make a convincing argument. If the examples or ideas we use come from other people, it is important that we give them appropriate credit for their work. This is called referencing. Using other people's ideas In the academic and professional world, referencing is the acknowledgement of other people\u2019s work and ideas. Academic assignments often involve investigating topics and gathering ideas, data, images, and other evidence to understand and support a position. Every time you use the ideas of someone else in your own work, you need to tell the reader where the information came from. Referencing has two parts: citations, and the reference list.  In the body of your work, any time you want to use a direct quote from someone else, talk about their ideas more generally, or incorporate a piece of their creative work into your own, you\u2019ll include a citation. Citations offer your audience key pieces of information about the source of an idea, such as the author\u2019s surname and the year of publication. At the end of your work, you\u2019ll attach a reference list, which provides the complete publication information for the sources you\u2019ve cited. Every citation will refer to an entry in the reference list.   Each professional discipline or area of study uses a specific set of referencing rules, called style guides, for formatting citations and creating a reference list. APA, Chicago, and RMIT Harvard are the names of some popular referencing styles. You can find the rules for these styles by visiting Easy Cite. Why is referencing important? Referencing is an integral part of academic and professional work. Accurate referencing is important for several reasons, which you can read about in detail below. It strengthens your arguments. By including references, you show your audience that you have investigated prior research and existing ideas about your topic, and that you are developing your own arguments after consideration of other work in the field. This demonstrates professionalism and can help your audience trust what you have to say. It enables others to understand how you came to your conclusions. References make it easy for other people to find the information you used to develop your arguments. If you include data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on income in Victoria, someone can find the same information by looking at your reference list and visiting the source for themselves. This makes it possible for others to verify your statements and understand how you arrived at the conclusions in your work. It shows you are acting with academic integrity. When you state where you found your information, you are showing respect for the work of others. This is a key aspect of academic integrity, as it shows your audience what knowledge or work already existed, and what ideas are your own. All publications are the intellectual property of the authors, so taking someone\u2019s ideas without acknowledgement and representing them as your own is a form of theft and fraud, known as plagiarism.","excerpt":"nodeID: 1775 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Referencing, or the acknowledgement of other people\u2019s work and ideas, is an integral part of academic and professional life.

Does this information \u2018belong\u2019 to someone who should be referenced? Read on to understand when citations are and are not necessary. Knowing when to provide a reference can take some practice. In general, you will always include citations for work or ideas that are not your own. There are a couple of key exceptions, however.  General knowledge As a guideline, you do not need to reference statements that are general knowledge, which are things that most people would know.   Examples   Australia is between the Pacific Ocean to the east, and the Indian Ocean to the west. This statement does not need a reference, particularly when writing in Australia.   The Pacific Ocean has a bigger surface area than all the land on earth combined (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022). This statement needs a reference, as it is not something that most people would know. Here a citation is provided in APA format and the full details appear in the reference list at the bottom of the page.   Historical overview Broad statements of historical overview also do not need to be referenced. A statement such as 'There were two world wars in the twentieth century\u2019 does not require a cited source. Your own ideas You do not need to cite your own ideas, unless you have already used them in a previous assignment. If your ideas have been included in your prior work, check with your instructor to ensure that self-citation is permitted in your course.   The following diagram can help you decide whether you need a reference. If in doubt, cite it. You will not be penalised for including a citation, and if you are citing too much, your instructor will let you know.  Should I cite it? Is it your idea, words or image?

Learn about using direct quotes and block quotes in your work.\r\n\r\nKeywords(tags): Citation, Referencing, Using quotes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting When you are researching a topic, sometimes you want to include the exact words of another author or speaker in your own work. Using someone\u2019s words in their original form is called quoting, or including a direct quote. When to quote Quoting is the way to include the exact words of others in our own work. You might want to use a quote when the specific words that an author or speaker has used are important, such as when someone offers a new definition for a term or presents a new theory. It is important to only use direct quotes when the exact words of someone else add particular value. If you use too many quotes, you are simply reporting information that you have found, instead of offering your own analysis and evaluation of the ideas. Paraphrasing and summarising, on the other hand, show that you have really understood the ideas or issues you are investigating. How to insert a direct quote Follow these steps to use direct quotes in your written assignments.  Copy the exact words from the original source. (If your quote is 40 words or longer, see the section below on using a block quote). Use quotation marks \" \" at the beginning and end of the copied text. Cite the quote following the citation format for your referencing style. This often means including information such as the author\u2019s surname, year of publication, and the page number where the quote appears.  Written example While no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, it has been defined as \"the act of needlessly delaying tasks to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort\" (Solomon & Rothblum, 1984). If you are reading a direct quote as part of an oral or multimedia presentation, you'll want to include the same citation information. You might say something like the example below. Spoken example While no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, Solomon and Rothblum defined the concept in their 1984 study, page 503, as \"the act of needlessly delaying tasks to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort\". Using a block quote  A block quote is a long direct quote, usually more than 30-40 words. Block quotes begin on a new line, and the entire quote is indented. Different referencing styles have different rules for exactly how to format block quotes within a larger text and where to place the citation. If direct quotes should be used infrequently, block quotes should be used even more sparingly. Many academic papers contain no block quotes at all. References  Solomon, L.J., & Rothblum, E.D. (1984).

It\u2019s easy to become repetitive, using \u2018this author said\u2019 and \u2018that author said\u2019 over and over. Reporting words tell your audience more about a person\u2019s position on a topic, not just that they \u2018said\u2019 something. Reporting words Reporting words are verbs that help us describe an author\u2019s position on a topic. The reporting word you choose can help your audience understand the viewpoint of the original author, or it might express your own opinion about that author\u2019s work. There are many of these words in English, and they all have different meanings. Some are more forceful, while others express a more modest position on a topic.  Examples Author (2023) questions the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years. Author (2023) dismisses the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.  In the first example, the word questions shows the audience that Author (2023) doesn\u2019t necessarily believe mining export income will increase. In contrast, the use of the word dismisses in the second example shows a much stronger position; Author is no longer just questioning the idea, but has completely rejected it. Choosing the right reporting word is tricky because of the way words have small differences in meaning as well as in the positive, negative, or neutral feelings connected to a word, also known as connotation. A dictionary can help you understand if you\u2019ve chosen the right reporting word for the idea you want to express. Examples of reporting words   Suggest (that) Studies outlined by Leonard et al. (1999) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Argue (that) Leonard et al. (1999) argue that there are three elements of self-perception.   Contend Mullins (1994) contends that motivation to work well is usually related to job satisfaction.   Outline As outlined by Mullins (1994), personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Focus on The early theories of Maslow and McGregor focused on personal needs and wants as the basis for motivation (Robbins et al. 2000).   Define Eunson (1987:67) defines motivation as \"what is important to you\".   Conclude Cherrington and England\u00a0(1980) conclude that not all workers are motivated by job enrichment.   State Hackman and Oldham (1975) state that there are five characteristics that can make a job more motivating.   Maintain (that) Mullins (1994) maintains that job enrichment was influenced by Herzber's two factor theory.   Found (that) Mullins (1994) found that there is an increasing importance placed on the role of autonomy and self-regulation of tasks in improving motivation.   Promote Hackman and Oldham (1975) promote the use of their Job Diagnostic Survey when considering how to redesign jobs for improved motivation and productivity.   Establish Csikszentmihalyi (1990, cited in Yair 2000:2) established that \"the more students feel in command of their learning, the more they fulfil their learning potential\".   Assert (that) Locke's Goal Setting Theory asserts that setting specific goals tends to encourage work motivation (Robbins et al. 2000).   Show Various theories of motivation show employers that there are many factors that influence employees' work performance.   Claim (that) Hackman and Oldham (1975) claim that people with enriched jobs, and high scores on the Job Diagnostic Survey, experienced more satisfaction and motivation.   Report Mullins (1994) reports on four content theories of motivation.   Mention Mullins (1994) mentions two common general criticisms of Herzberg's theory.   Address Mullins (1994) addresses how the shifting of responsibility from management to workers might mitigate issues of job satisfaction.

If we are able to write an equation relating \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) explicitly, that is in the form \\(y=f(x)\\), then we can find the derivative function \\(y=f'\\left(x\\right)\\) or \\(y=\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) using the rules we have learned so far. For example, if \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =3x^{2}-2x+5 \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dy}{dx} &amp; =6x-2. \\end{align*}\\] But how do we differentiate expressions such as \\(y^{5}+3xy+x^{2}-5=0\\) or find \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(sin(xy)\\right)\\)? In such expressions \\(y\\) is said to be an implicit function of \\(x\\) as we cannot rearrange the expression to the form \\(y=f(x)\\).

We need to be able to differentiate \\(z\\) with respect to either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). If we treat one of the variables, say \\(y\\), as a constant, then we can treat \\(z\\) as a function of just one variable, \\(x\\).

It is possible to find second, third and subsequent derivatives by continuing to differentiate and these are called higher order derivatives: \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =24x-12\\text{ $\\left(\\text{second derivative}\\right)$ }\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =24\\text{ $\\left(\\text{third derivative}\\right)$ }\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =0\\text{ $\\left(\\text{fourth derivative}\\right)$ } \\end{align*}\\] and all subsequent derivatives will also be zero.  Other Notations Recall that for the first derivative we may write \\(f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). Similarly for higher order derivatives \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}},\\,f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}}\\) and so on. We may also write\\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=f^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(x\\right),\\,f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=f^{\\left(3\\right)}\\left(x\\right)\\) etc. and where there is no confusion \\(y^{\\prime},y^{\\prime\\prime},y^{\\prime\\prime\\prime},\\ldots\\) can be used to represent first, second, third and other higher order derivatives. Note that sometimes roman numerals are used and so \\(f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right)=f^{\\left(iv\\right)}\\left(x\\right).\\)   Applications Higher derivatives are used in many mathematical, scientific and engineering subjects. Some examples follow.  Acceleration: Velocity \\(v\\left(t\\right)\\) is the first derivative of the displacement function \\(s\\left(t\\right)\\) with respect to time . \\[\\begin{align*} v &amp; =\\frac{ds}{dt} \\end{align*}\\] And acceleration is the rate of change or first derivative of the velocity function. It follows that acceleration \\(a\\) is the second derivative of the displacement function: \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{d^{2}s}{dt^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\]   Beam deflection: The equation which describes the deflection \\(w\\) of a uniform static beam in engineering makes use of the fourth derivative: \\[ EI\\frac{d^{4}w}{dx^{4}}=q(x). \\]   Points of inflection: When graphing a function the second derivative is the rate of change of the derivative function. It describes the concavity of the curve and indicates whether the slope of the function is increasing or decreasing.   If the graph of the function is concave upward the second derivative is positive - slope increasing. If the graph of the function is concave downward the second derivative is negative - slope decreasing. At a point of inflection, where the curve changes concavity, the second derivative is zero.    Example 1 Find the \\(4^{th}\\text{ derivative of $f\\left(x\\right)=\\sin\\left(2x\\right).$ }\\) Solution \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2\\cos(2x)\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =-4\\sin(2x)\\\\ f^{\\left(3\\right)}(x) &amp; =-8\\cos(2x)\\\\ f^{\\left(4\\right)}(x) &amp; =16\\sin(2x). \\end{align*}\\] The fourth derivative of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\sin\\left(2x\\right)\\) is \\(f^{\\left(4\\right)}(x)=16\\sin(2x).\\)   Example 2 If \\(f\\left(x\\right)=3x^{4}-5x^{2}+7,\\) find \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right).\\) Solution \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =12x^{3}-10x\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =36x^{2}-10. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 3 Find \\(\\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}\\) if \\(y=\\ln\\left(1+t^{4}\\right)\\) Solution Using the chain rule, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; =\\frac{1}{1+t^{4}}4t^{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4t^{3}}{1+t^{4}}. \\end{align*}\\] Now applying the quotient rule, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{\\left(1+t^{4}\\right)\\cdot12t^{2}-4t^{3}\\cdot4t^{3}}{\\left(1+t^{4}\\right)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{12t^{2}+12t^{6}-16t^{6}}{\\left(1+t^{4}\\right)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{12t^{2}-4t^{6}}{\\left(1+t^{4}\\right)^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 4 Find the \\(x-\\)coordinates of the points of inflection for the curve with equation: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\frac{x^{4}}{12}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3}-\\frac{3x^{2}}{2}+3x-7. \\end{align*}\\] Solution \\[\\begin{align*} y^{\\prime} &amp; =\\frac{4x^{3}}{12}+\\frac{3x^{2}}{3}-\\frac{6x}{2}+3\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+x^{2}-3x+3\\\\ y^{\\prime\\prime} &amp; =x^{2}+2x-3. \\end{align*}\\] Points of inflection will occur where \\(y^{\\prime\\prime}=0:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2x-3 &amp; =0\\\\ (x+3)(x-1) &amp; =0\\\\ x=-3,\\ &amp; x=1 \\end{align*}\\] There are points of inflection at \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=1\\) and this is confirmed by the graph of the function.

Definite Integral of an Exponential Function Now that we know how to get an antiderivative (or indefinite integral) of an exponential function we can consider definite integrals. To evaluate a definite integral we determine an antiderivative and calculate the difference of the values of the antiderivative at the limits defined in the definite integral.

So we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{\\pi\/2}3\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =\\left[3\\sin\\left(x\\right)+c\\right]_{x=0}^{x=\\pi\/2} &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(3\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+c\\right)-\\left(3\\sin\\left(0\\right)+c\\right) &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =3+c-0-c &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =3. &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that the notation in line \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[3\\sin\\left(x\\right)+c\\right]_{x=0}^{x=\\pi\/2} \\end{align*}\\] means substitute \\(x=\\pi\/2\\) in the expression in brackets and subtract the expression in brackets evaluated at \\(x=0.\\) Note also that the constant \\(c\\) in lines \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) has no effect when evaluating a definite integral. Consequently we usually leave it out and write \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{\\pi\/2}3\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =\\left[3\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right]_{x=0}^{x=\\pi\/2} &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(3\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)-\\left(3\\sin\\left(0\\right)\\right) &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =3-0 &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =3. &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\]  Examples  Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{\\,\\pi\/4}5\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx.\\) Solution: 2 Remember that \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{\\,\\pi\/4}5\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =\\left[5\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right]_{x=0}^{x=\\pi\/4}\\\\ &amp; =5\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)-5\\sin\\left(0\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{align*}\\] Evaluate \\(\\int_{-\\pi\/4}^{\\pi\/4}3\\cos\\left(\\pi-2x\\right)dx\\).

Learn about systems thinking and the circular economy and how this relates to your life.\n\nKeywords(tags): Sustainability, Systems thinking\n\n\n\nSystems thinking is a way of thinking about our products, businesses and services not just in terms of the final product or service, but also the ways that product or service impacts people and planet. As we discussed briefly, a system is a group of objects and forces that influence each other. We live in many systems:  solar system justice systems IT systems economic systems  Systems thinking means considering the effects on all parts of a system rather than just one. We live on the planet earth, which is a closed system. Waste we generate stays on earth. Damaging the environment in one area can have effects on other areas. Circular economy The circular economy uses systems thinking to create products that are meant to be recycled or reused. You can see the difference between a traditional linear economy and a circular economy in engineering, in the image below. Circular economies do not end in waste; products are reused or recycled, or even better designed with the next purpose in mind.  Image attribution: Mc4zero, CC BY-SA 4.0 on Wikimedia Commons Repair, reuse, recycle A circular economy requires that products are made in a way that does not create waste. Making products that have little or no waste is much better than relying on recycling. Products that are built to be reusable or easily repaired are the best. There are many examples from the past when people owned their clothes, furniture, and other items for life or even longer.  Image attribution:&nbsp;by Stockwerk-Fotodesign on Adobe Stock Technological waste Technology produces a lot of waste, some of it is toxic. The materials used to make phones, laptops, games consoles and other technology are hard or impossible to recycle, and therefore create waste when they are created and waste at the end of their life. There is a push for tech companies to make products that can be easily repaired rather than thrown away. Allowing people to fix their phones and replace broken parts will save a lot of money and stop a lot of waste. Reusable bottles and containers In many places, milk used to be sold in reusable glass bottles. The empty bottles were left out after use and taken back to be cleaned and refilled with fresh milk. There are some grocery stores that sell their food without any packaging today, where customers bring their own containers to fill with the products they want to buy. Jars as drinking glasses  For many years, Vegemite and other products were sold in jars that were designed to be drinking glasses when empty. Jars were even printed with cartoon characters and pictures. When glass recycling became more available, the jars were not made anymore. But it is much better to reuse glass. Glass recycling uses a lot of energy &ndash; to melt the glass and reshape it &ndash; and putting jars on a truck makes air pollution. Putting Vegemite and Nutella in jars that were reused was a circular economy. Repair People did not always buy new things like we do today. In the past, people repaired things when they broke or reused them in a new way. There are many cities with 'repair cafes' where you can take broken items to be fixed, saving you money, and saving the environment. While there are many ideas from the past that we could bring back, there are also ways to create modern items that make less waste. Further resources RMIT has a Circular Economy Hub where you can learn more about what is happening at RMIT and with industry partners. RMIT also as a Sustainable Retail Framework where you can learn more about RMIT's changes. They also have events such as repair cafes, fashion swaps and more.

Life below water  Image attribution: damedias on Adobe Stock Targets Having a goal of preserving life below water sounds great, but how do we achieve it? How do we know if we are meeting the goal? There are targets that break the goal down into smaller parts. Parts that individuals, countries, and businesses can work on. These targets include dates, so there is a deadline for completing them. They are strategic; they help to create positive change and achieve the goal of preserving \"Life below water.\" Examples RMIT is working on projects that will help to meet the SDG 14 targets set by the UN. These projects are only a few of many projects happening across the world. The power of an SDG is that it is global and targeted. The Litter Trackers RMIT has been working with other organisations to create an education programme about litter in Melbourne. Litter left on the ground is washed into stormwater drains and from there into Port Phillip Bay. Rubbish and litter has a negative effect on the environment, the creatures living in the bay, birds and more. By tracking litter, the program can educate people about the importance of disposing of waste properly. Find out more about The Litter Trackers: Reducing Littering by Education.   Image attributon: from RMIT's Acquatic Pollution Prevention project  Aquatic Pollution Prevention Partnership RMIT is not just working on educating people about litter in Port Phillip Bay, it is also preventing it from reaching the water. In this partnership with Melbourne Water, RMIT is working on solutions to prevent litter and other waste from reaching Port Phillip Bay and other Victorian waterways. Learn more about the Aquatic Pollution prevention Partnership These examples show that sustainability projects often address more than one SDG. For example, a project that educates, reduced litter and works to improve water quality, can have impacts on Goal 6 &mdash; Clean water and sanitation and Goal 4 &mdash; Quality education. The best goals are the ones that you can, and do, complete. Even better than completing a single goal is when that goal has a positive impact on many things.","excerpt":"nodeID: 1740 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cover many different areas of life.

Below are some tips that can help you take good notes in class and revise them after class.\n\nIn class time\nDuring class teachers use various strategies to indicate to students what is important. Being aware of these helps you identify the main ideas and take useful notes. When taking notes, it\u2019s a good idea to pay attention to:\nIntroductions and conclusions\nIn the introduction, the lecturer usually outlines the important points, connects them with the previous and next lectures and puts the topic in context. The conclusion summarises the main points. Therefore, paying attention to the beginning and ending of lectures is very important.\n\nFor example: Today we\u2019ll be talking about the effect of information overload on the short-term memory. There are three main points \u2026\nVoice emphasis\nIn lectures and tutorials, important ideas, words and phrases are often emphasised. A lecturer or teacher may do this by saying them more slowly, more loudly, or by pausing. Gestures and movement may also be used for emphasis.\nLinking expressions\nListen for words and phrases that direct you to new and important ideas or show the relationships between the points being raised.

Read this section to find examples of this being done. To sketch a curve it is helpful to find the  \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts Maximum and minimum points.  This module describes how to do this.  Definition of Maximum and Minimum A stationary point is a point on a graph of a function \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) where the tangent to the curve is horizontal. At a stationary point the derivative function \\(y=f'\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) A maximum stationary point occurs at \\(x=a\\) if \\(f'\\left(a\\right)=0\\) and \\(f'\\left(x\\right)&gt;0\\) for \\(x&lt;a\\) and \\(f'\\left(x\\right)&lt;0\\) for \\(x&gt;a\\) as shown below.  A minimum stationary point occurs at \\(x=a\\) if \\(f'\\left(a\\right)=0\\) and \\(f'\\left(x\\right)\\)&lt; 0 for \\(x&lt;a\\) and \\(f'\\left(x\\right)\\)&gt; 0 for \\(x&gt;a\\) as shown below.    Example 1 Find the turning point of the parabola defined by \\(y=x^{2}+4x+5\\) and determine if it is a maximum or minimum. Solution Let \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}+4x+5 \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2x+4. \\end{align*}\\] At a stationary point, \\(f'\\left(x\\right)=0,\\) so \\[\\begin{align*} 2x+4 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x &amp; =-4\\\\ x &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] is the \\(x-\\)coordinate of a stationary point. When \\(x=-2,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =(-2)^{2}+4(-2)+5\\\\ &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the coordinates of the stationary point are \\(\\left(-2,1\\right).\\) Now we ascertain if it is a maximum or minimum. A sign test can be used to determine whether the stationary point is minimum or a maximum by checking the slope of the tangent on each side of the stationary point. Consider the table below.  As we move from the left to the right of the stationary point at \\(x=-2\\), the gradient changes from negative to positive. This indicates there is a minimum at \\(\\left(-2,1\\right)\\). Hence the turning point of the parabola is a minimum and occurs at \\(\\left(-2,1\\right)\\).   Example 2 Sketch the graph of \\(y=x^{3}-x.\\) Solution strategy:  Find intercepts on \\(x-\\)axis. Find stationary points. Establish if stationary points are maximum or minimum values. Plot intercepts and stationary points and sketch the graph.  Solution For \\(x-\\)axis intercepts, we set \\(y=0,\\) so \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =x^{3}-x\\\\ &amp; =x\\left(x^{2}-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Consequently, \\(x=0\\) or \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-1 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =1\\text{ or $-1.$ } \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(x-\\)axis intercepts are \\(\\left(-1,0\\right),\\ \\left(0,0\\right)\\ \\text{and $\\left(1,0\\right)$ .}\\) For stationary points, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dy}{dx} &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] that is \\[\\begin{align*} 3x^{2}-1 &amp; =0\\\\ x^{2} &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ x &amp; =\\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\\\ &amp; \\approx\\pm0.58. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting these \\(x\\) values back in \\(y=x-x^{3}\\) gives for \\(x=1\/\\sqrt{3}\\), \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{3}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\\\ &amp; \\approx-0.39.\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] For \\(x=-1\/\\sqrt{3}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{3}-\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\\\ &amp; \\approx0.38.\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Hence the stationary points occur at approximately, \\(\\left(0.58,-0.39\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-0.58,0.38\\right)\\). Now we decide if these points are maxima or minima. Consider the tables below. For \\(x\\approx0.58\\) we have  and so the point \\(x=1\/\\sqrt{3}\\approx0.58\\) is a minimum. For \\(x\\approx-0.58\\) we have  and so the point \\(x=-1\/\\sqrt{3}\\approx-0.58\\) is a maximum. We can now graph \\(y=x^{3}-x\\). First plot the \\(x-\\)intercepts and the stationary points:  We know \\(E\\) is a maximum and \\(D\\) is a minimum and so can graph \\(y=x^{3}-x\\) as shown below.    Exercise Sketch the graphs of the following functions showing all intercepts and turning points  \\(y=x^{2}-4x\\) \\(y=x^{3}-2x^{2}+x\\) \\(y=6-x-x^{2}\\) \\(y=\\left(x+1\\right)^{4}\\)       Download this page, D9 Curve Sketching (PDF 779KB)  What's next...

The calculator may only give you one answer to an inverse trig question between 0 and 90 degrees (say InvCos = 40\u00b0). The unit circle can help you visualise the many different solutions for finding your angle \u03b1.  This module describes how to solve trigonometric equations over a prescribed domain. An example of such an equation is: Solve \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =0.5 \\end{align*}\\] if \\(-\\pi\\leq\\theta\\leq3\\pi\\). Solving these types of problem is easier if you can identify the values of trigonometric functions on a unit circle as shown in the example below. You also need to understand angles in degrees and radians.  Example 1 Given that \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3,\\) find all values of \\(\\theta\\) in the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\theta:0^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq360^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\) Solution Draw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\theta\\) as shown below:  There are at least two solutions shown in red and blue. We have \\(\\theta_{r}\\) (in red) which is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta_{r} &amp; =\\sin^{-1}\\left(0.3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =17.46^{\\circ}.\\text{ (from calculator)} \\end{align*}\\] The other angle \\(\\theta_{b}\\) (in blue) may be found by symmetry: \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta_{b} &amp; =180^{\\circ}-\\theta_{r}\\\\ &amp; =180^{\\circ}-17.46^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =162.54^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solutions are \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ},\\,162.54^{\\circ}.\\)   Example 2 Given that \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3,\\) find all values of \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(0^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq500^{\\circ}.\\) Solution Note that this is the same problem as in Example 1 except that the domain in which we are looking for solutions has been extended to \\(500^{\\circ}.\\) Draw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\theta\\) as shown below:  From Example 1 we know \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ}\\)or \\(162.54^{\\circ}.\\) If we add \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to each of these, they will still satisfy \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3.\\) The question is, are they in the domain of interest? Adding \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to the solution \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ}\\) found in Example 1 gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =17.46^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =377.46^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] which is less than \\(500^{\\circ}\\) and so a solution to Example 2. Adding \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to the other solution to Example \\(1\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =162.54^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =522.54^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] which is bigger than \\(500^{\\circ}\\) and so not a solution to Example 2. Hence the solutions are \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ},\\,162.54^{\\circ}\\) and \\(377.46^{\\circ}.\\)   Example 3 Solve \\(\\cos\\alpha=0.5\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\alpha:0\\leq\\alpha\\leq2\\pi\\right\\} .\\) Solution Draw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\alpha\\) as shown below:  Referring to the figure, \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{1} &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(0.5\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\ (\\text{from calculator)} \\end{align*}\\] and from symmetry of the unit circle, \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{2} &amp; =2\\pi-\\alpha_{1}\\\\ &amp; =2\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(\\alpha=\\pi\/3\\) and \\(5\\pi\/3.\\)   Example 4 Solve \\(\\cos\\alpha=0.5\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\alpha:-2\\pi\\leq\\alpha\\leq2\\pi\\right\\} .\\) Solution Note this is the same problem as in Example 3 but the domain has been extended. Draw a picture showing the possible positive and negative values for \\(\\alpha\\) as shown below:  The two positive angles (shown in red) are the same as those in Example 3, namely \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{1} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ \\alpha_{2} &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The negative angles (shown in blue) are \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{4}.\\) Using the results from Example 3 and symmetry we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{3} &amp; =-\\alpha_{1}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{4} &amp; =-\\left(2\\pi-\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\alpha_{1}-2\\pi\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}-2\\pi\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(\\alpha=-\\frac{5\\pi}{3},\\,-\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\,\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{3}.\\)   Example 5 Solve \\(\\tan\\left(2x\\right)=-3\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ x:-90^{\\circ}\\leq x\\leq180^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\) Solution Since the variable is \\(2x,\\) we have to redefine the domain to \\(\\left\\{ 2x:-180^{\\circ}\\leq2x\\leq360^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\) Draw a picture showing the possible positive and negative values for \\(2x\\) as shown below:  There are two positive angles \\(\\alpha_{1},\\,\\alpha_{2}\\) (shown in red) and two negative angles \\(\\alpha_{3,}\\,\\alpha_{4}\\) (shown in blue) that may lie within \\(-180^{\\circ}\\leq2x\\leq360^{\\circ}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(2x\\right) &amp; =-3\\\\ 2x &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ}\\ \\text{(from calculator).} \\end{align*}\\] Referring to the figure, we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{3} &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{4} &amp; =\\alpha_{3}-180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ}-180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =-251.57^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that this is outside of the domain for \\(2x\\) and so is rejected. That is we discard \\(\\alpha_{4}.\\) Using the symmetry of the unit circle, we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{1} &amp; =360^{\\circ}+\\alpha_{4}\\\\ &amp; =360^{\\circ}-251.57^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =108.43^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] and using the figure, \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{2} &amp; =\\alpha_{1}+180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =108.43^{\\circ}+180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =288.43^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} 2x &amp; =\\alpha_{3},\\ \\alpha_{1},\\ \\alpha_{2}\\\\ &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ},\\ 108.43^{\\circ},\\ 288.43^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] and the solution is \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =-35.79^{\\circ},\\ 54.22^{\\circ},\\ 144.22^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises Solve the following equations: \\(\\text{a) If $\\sin\\phi=0.25$ find $\\phi$ for $0^{\\circ}\\leq\\phi\\leq180^{\\circ}$ .}\\) \\(\\text{b) If $\\tan\\phi=0.8$ find }\\phi\\) for \\(0^{\\circ}\\leq\\phi\\leq360^{\\circ}\\). \\(\\text{c) If $\\cos\\phi=0.4$ find $\\phi\\ \\text{for $0^{\\circ}\\leq\\phi\\leq360^{\\circ}.$ }$ }\\) \\(\\text{d) If $\\cos\\phi=-0.4\\ \\text{find $\\phi\\text{ for $-180^{\\circ}\\leq\\phi\\leq360^{\\circ}.$ }$ }$ }\\) \\(\\text{e) If $\\tan\\phi=-1.5\\ \\text{find $\\phi\\ \\text{for $-180^{\\circ}\\leq\\phi\\leq360^{\\circ}.$ }$ }$ }\\) \\(\\text{f) If $\\cos\\phi=-0.3\\ \\text{find $\\phi$ for $0^{\\circ}\\leq$ $\\phi\\leq360^{\\circ}.$ }$ }\\)      Download this page, T7 Trigonometric equations (PDF 743KB)   What's next...

The vector product is a vector that is the result of multiplying the magnitudes (size) of two vectors. The magnitude is found using matrices and determinants).   The result of the cross product is another vector, and the direction is perpendicular (normal, at 90 degrees) to the plane of both the original vectors. There are two ways to multiply two vectors:  The scalar product which gives a number (also called the dot product); The vector product which gives a vector (also called the cross product).  In this module we consider the vector or cross product.  Definition Let \\(\\hat{i},\\,\\) \\(\\hat{j}\\) and \\(\\hat{k}\\) be unit vectors in the \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) directions respectively. We can write \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{i} &amp; =\\hat{i}+0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1,0,0\\right)\\\\ \\hat{j} &amp; =0\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(0,1,0\\right)\\\\ \\hat{k} &amp; =0\\hat{i}+0\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(0,0,1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Let the vectors \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a} &amp; =a_{1}\\hat{i}+a_{2}\\hat{j}+a_{3}\\hat{k} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{b} &amp; =b_{1}\\hat{i}+b_{2}\\hat{j}+b_{3}\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\] The vector, or cross, product of the two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is the vector1 Here, \\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) and \\(\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\) are the magnitudes of the vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\).  \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,\\hat{n} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{n}\\) is a unit vector that is perpendicular to both \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\). To calculate the cross product, it is more convenient to use the definition2 Here the two vertical delimiters \\(\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|\\) denote the determinant of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). For a two by two matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] the determinant \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right| &amp; =ad-bc. \\end{align*}\\] This is quite different to the magnitude of a vector \\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k}\\\\ a_{1} &amp; a_{2} &amp; a_{3}\\\\ b_{1} &amp; b_{2} &amp; b_{3} \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\hat{i}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; a_{3}\\\\ b_{2} &amp; b_{3} \\end{array}\\right|-\\hat{j}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; a_{3}\\\\ b_{1} &amp; b_{3} \\end{array}\\right|+\\hat{k}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; a_{2}\\\\ b_{1} &amp; b_{2} \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\hat{i}\\left(a_{2}b_{3}-b_{2}a_{3}\\right)-\\hat{j}\\left(a_{1}b_{3}-b_{1}a_{3}\\right)+\\hat{k}\\left(a_{1}b_{2}-b_{1}a_{2}\\right). &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]   Properties of the Vector or Cross Product  If \\(\\vec{a}\\) is parallel to \\(\\vec{b}\\) then \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=\\vec{0}\\). This follows from eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above3 If \\(\\vec{a}\\) is parallel to \\(\\vec{b}\\) the angle between them is \\(0\\). Hence from eqn\\(\\left(1\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\sin\\left(0\\right)\\,\\hat{n}\\\\ &amp; =\\vec{0} \\end{align*}\\] as \\(\\sin\\left(0\\right)=0\\).. Note that we should write the answer as the zero vector \\(\\vec{0}\\) instead of the number \\(0.\\)4 This is a technical point and relates to the concept of a vector space in which certain operations are closed. Closed means if you do operations on a vector you get a vector as a result. In many courses you don\u2019t need to worry about this so writing \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=0\\) may be allowed. Please see you teacher on this point. The order in which you take the cross product is important. In fact, \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=-\\vec{b}\\times\\vec{a}.\\) The direction of \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\) is perpendicular to both \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) in the direction in which your thumb would point if the fingers of your right hand are curled from \\(\\vec{a}\\) to \\(\\vec{b}\\) as shown below   This is called the right hand rule.  Example 1 Find \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\) if \\(\\vec{a}=2\\vec{i}+3\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=5\\vec{j}+3\\vec{k}\\). Solution \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k}\\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\hat{i}\\left(3\\times3-5\\times1\\right)-\\hat{j}\\left(2\\times3-0\\times1\\right)+\\hat{k}\\left(2\\times5-0\\times3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(9-5\\right)\\hat{i}-\\left(6-0\\right)\\hat{j}+\\left(10-0\\right)\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =4\\hat{i}-6\\hat{j}+10\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 2 Find \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\) if \\(\\vec{a}=\\left(2,1,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=\\left(-2,4,0\\right)\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k}\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\hat{i}\\left(1\\times0-4\\times1\\right)-\\hat{j}\\left(2\\times0-\\left(-2\\right)\\times1\\right)+\\hat{k}\\left(2\\times4-\\left(-2\\right)\\times1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-4\\hat{i}-2\\hat{j}+10\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\]    Example 3 Find \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\) if \\(\\vec{a}=\\left(2,1,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=\\left(8,4,4\\right)\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k}\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 8 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\hat{i}\\left(1\\times4-4\\times1\\right)-\\hat{j}\\left(2\\times4-8\\times1\\right)+\\hat{k}\\left(2\\times4-8\\times1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0\\hat{i}-0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =0\\hat{i}+0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(0,0,0\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\vec{0}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that \\(0\\hat{i}-0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}=0\\hat{i}+0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\) and that the answer is the vector \\(\\left(0,0,0\\right)=\\vec{0},\\) not simply the number \\(0\\) (see footnote 2 above). Since neither\\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) nor \\(\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\) is zero, from equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above, we can see that \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)=0\\) and so \\(\\theta=0\\) or \\(\\theta=\\pi.\\) That is the vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) are in the same or opposite directions. This result could be more quickly obtained by observing that \\(\\vec{b}=4\\vec{a}\\) and so \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) are parallel and by property \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) of the vector product above, \\(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=\\vec{0}\\).    Cartesian Unit Vectors Let \\(\\hat{i},\\,\\) \\(\\hat{j}\\) and \\(\\hat{k}\\) be unit vectors in the \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) directions respectively.

This is the result of multiplying the magnitudes of the components of two or more vectors. The result is not a vector, but a scalar (which is without direction).  There are two ways to multiply two vectors:  The scalar or dot product which gives a number; The vector or cross product which gives a vector.  In this module we consider the scalar or dot product.  Definition The scalar, or dot, product of two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\left(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\left(b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}\\right)\\) is a scalar, defined by: \\[ \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3} \\] or geometrically, \\[ \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\).    Properties of the Scalar or Dot Product  If \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) are non-zero vectors and \\(\\vec{a}\\) is perpendicular1 Perpendicular means at right angles to. A right angle is \\(90^{\\circ}=\\pi\/2.\\) to \\(\\vec{b}\\) then \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=0,\\) since \\(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). If \\(\\vec{a}\\) is parallel to \\(\\vec{b}\\) then the angle between the vectors is \\(0\\) and \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=\\mid\\vec{a}\\mid\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid\\) as \\(\\cos\\left(0\\right)=1\\). The dot product does not depend on the order of multiplication: \\[ \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a} \\] In three dimensions with \\(\\hat{i},\\) \\(\\hat{j}\\) and \\(\\hat{k}\\) unit vectors along the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) axes respectively, we have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{i}\\cdot\\vec{j} &amp; =\\vec{j}\\cdot\\vec{k}=\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{i}=0\\\\ \\vec{i}\\cdot\\vec{i} &amp; =\\vec{j}\\cdot\\vec{j}=\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{k}=1 \\end{align*}\\]   Examples  \\(\\left(2\\vec{i}+3\\vec{j}+4\\vec{k}\\right)\\cdot\\left(-\\vec{i}-2\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}\\right)=\\left(2\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\right)+\\left(3\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)+\\left(4\\times1\\right)=-4\\) \\(\\left(2,-3,-3\\right)\\cdot\\left(1,1,-2\\right)=2-3+6=5\\) \\(\\left(5,0,-1\\right)\\cdot\\left(1,4,3\\right)=5+0-3=2\\) \\(\\left(2\\vec{i}+4\\vec{k}\\right)\\cdot\\left(-3\\vec{i}-2\\vec{j}\\right)=2\\times\\left(-3\\right)+0\\times\\left(-2\\right)+4\\times0=-6\\)  See Exercises 1, 2, and 3.    Angle Between Two Vectors The angle \\(\\theta,\\left(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\right)\\), between two vectors can be found using the definition of the dot product: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =\\mid\\vec{a}\\mid\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid\\cos\\theta. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging, \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\mid\\vec{a}\\mid\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\mid\\vec{a}\\mid\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid}\\right). \\end{align*}\\]  Examples  If \\(\\vec{a}=\\left(2,3,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=\\left(5,-2,2\\right)\\) find the angle \\(\\theta\\), between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\mid\\vec{a}\\mid\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid}\\right)\\\\ \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left(2,3,1\\right)\\cdot\\left(5,-2,2\\right)=6\\\\ \\mid\\vec{a}\\mid &amp; =\\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{14},\\mid\\vec{b}\\mid=\\sqrt{25+4+4}=\\sqrt{33}\\\\ \\theta &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{33}\\times\\sqrt{14}}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(0.2791\\right)\\\\ \\theta &amp; =73.8^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] The angle between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is \\(73.8^{\\circ}\\).

Sustainability is woven throughout our lives, so understanding how it impacts life and work is important for all of us, no matter our career paths or where we live. We can already see changes towards a green and fair future being made by people and organisations in industries and workplaces around Australia and the world. A sustainable future is one where we can safely live on our planet Earth for a very long time.  Image attribution: j-mel on Adobe Stock Creating systems, processes and products that minimise the negative impact humans have on the environment and our own wellbeing is a focus of sustainability. The climate crisis, waste, fast fashion, species loss, access to safe water, reducing natural disasters and preventing pollution are just some of the issues that are part of thinking about sustainability. The United Nations (UN) is an international organisation with 193 member states where the world's nations can come together to discuss common problems and find shared solutions. The UN has, in recent years, set up working groups to develop guidelines and goals for sustainability. They call for \"action by all countries, poor, rich and middle-income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet\". Individuals, organisations and governments can participate in these Sustainable Development Goals, which will be covered here.  What's in this resource?  The first section will explain the history of the UN&nbsp;Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The second section&nbsp;will explore systems thinking, whichcan be used as&nbsp;a way of understanding and dealing with environmental problems. This includes thinking about the relationship between people, the environment and business. The third section,&nbsp;SDGs in your life, will give examples of sustainability in industry, at RMIT and in other parts of your life. Learn how to create a green event or&nbsp;about sustainable fashion and construction. This section also includes a learning activity that will help you to make your own sustainable development goal.

We can think about the world we live in as a series of connected systems, from the solar system down to your local transport systems. Systems thinking is used in science to describe complicated relationships between parts of a whole. We talk about the 'solar system' to describe the group of planets and objects that orbit our sun. The solar system is a whole and each planet and the sun are the parts. There are also gravity, asteroids, heat, moons and more in this system.  Image atribution: Hilch on Adobe Stock Systems thinking in sustainability is a way of thinking about how we make goods and deliver services. It considers the environmental and social impacts for different businesses. In the solar system, we know that changes in the sun or other objects in the system, have effects on Earth. In business, we know that changing how much workers are paid or what materials we use affects social and economic systems. We also know that what happens in business affects the system we all live in &mdash; the Earth. The environment is a planet-wide system that affects us all. The economy is another system, a way of deciding value and exchanging goods and services. People live in societies in which there are also systems though these might not be as obvious as in a physical system. All these different systems interact with each other. A change in the solar system can cause a change on Earth. A big solar storm causes blackouts. A change in the environment causes a change in society. Increased temperatures make people spend more time in their homes and less time socialising. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a way of making changes that have positive outcomes in many systems. We have economic, social and environmental problems that are related to each other. The United Nations includes poverty, equality and justice in the Sustainable Development Goals because we cannot fix one system and cause a problem in another.

They know some of the children do not eat breakfast before school, so they decide to provide a free breakfast. After speaking to businesses, they find a company that will provide a discounted breakfast, so they raise money and buy breakfasts for the kids. The children are happy to receive the breakfast and teachers report that the children are more focussed and answering more questions in the morning classes. After a week, the school asks Kalitha and Jain to stop providing the breakfasts. When Kalitha talks to the school principal, she learns that the breakfasts have created a waste problem. The breakfasts come in a plastic container and the school bins are overflowing with rubbish. The rubbish also costs the school money becasue they must pay a company to take away their waste and the extra waste costs more to remove. The school, the children, parents and Kalitha and Jain want the program to continue but they do not want to create a waste problem and cost the school money. Luckily, they talk to some parents and one of the mothers works for a recycling company. The recycling company takes plastic and turns it into pellets that are sold to be made into new products. The company is happy to take the plastic waste, and they even pay the school for the plastic. The company will only take the waste if it is properly sorted and there are no other kinds of rubbish mixed in. The company sends special plastic bins for collecting the extra waste. Kalitha and Jain create signs for the school to show the children which bin their rubbish needs to go in. From one bad consequence to lots of good outcomes!

Big companies can sell cheap clothes by manufacturing them in countries where workers may not be paid a living wage. In more affluent societies, these garments are considered disposable and not kept as long as they could be. A 'living wage' means paying workers enough to take care of themselves and their families, which includes affording things like housing, food, health care and education for their children.    Image attribution: HollyHarry on Adobe Stock Pressure is rising for designers and clothing manufacturers to reduce the impact of fashion. There are many areas of manufacture in the fashion and textile industry where changes can be made to make this industry more sustainable. Textile recycling &ndash; the textiles (fabric and other materials used to make clothing) can be broken down and the fibres (threads that make up the fabric) can be recycled into new clothes. Repair &ndash; creating garments that are easy to repair ensures that they can last longer. Wages &ndash; garment workers (people who make clothes) are paid a living wage. Reuse - high quality, well made clothes can be resold many times. Cheap, badly made clothes cannot. What is fast fashion? Fast fashion is growing around the world. Fast fashion are clothes made very cheaply and quickly that are only worn a few times before being thrown away. People today own far more clothes than they used to in the past, and some of these clothes are cheap and not made to last. The actual cost of the clothes is much higher than the price people are paying to buy them if we think about the cost of waste produced. Some experts have suggested that by making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of dealing with clothing waste, we might stop people from buying so many cheap clothes.  Image attribution: Halfpoint on Adobe Stock The rise of Internet shopping, propelled further by the recent pandemic, has made it very easy to buy new clothes. Many of these clothes are very cheap. No one needs to buy new clothes every week or every month. Making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of waste is one way to change fast fashion. There are companies recycling textiles that break down the clothes and create new threads and materials. There are many drop-off points in Australia that will accept old clothes for recycling. Buying recycled clothing can help to make the fashion industry more sustainable. If you are choosing new clothes, look for recycled fabrics and support companies that recycle, or are 'fair trade' and pay their workers a fair price for their labour.

Water Encourage people to bring their own water bottle to the event. Provide people with places they can refill water bottles. Consider selling or giving away reusable water bottles so everyone can use one. Did you know you can hire composting or chemical toilets? Using water to flush toilets uses anwhere between 6 to 15 litres of water per flush.  Waste Sorting waste on the site and making sure it goes to the right place is the first step. Where is the right place? Where the waste is recycled or reused rather than going to landfill. Having clear signs will make sure the waste goes to the right bin, saving recycling from being contaminated with rubbish. Food waste Sell tickets or ask people to register to come. Then you know how many people will be there and you can order enough food for everyone and not waste extra food. Any leftover food and green waste can be collected and turned to compost or soil.  Energy Think about where will your power will come from. Can you use solar panels and batteries instead of electricity from fossil fuels? Transportation Consider how people will get to the festival.

Construction companies lose a lot of money because of climate change. Bad weather, worsening storms, and other changes stop construction and cause expensive delays. Climate change also means we will use more concrete to make things, as concrete is heavier, harder and better at making buildings that will last in big storms and other extreme weather conditions. Finding new materials or new ways to make things like concrete is key to creating sustainable construction.

Tyres:  contain toxic chemicals last for many hundreds of years without breaking down are also very flammable &ndash; they catch on fire easily and the fires are hard to put out are dangerous in landfill because they are a fire risk.  Sustainable solution RMIT researchers have found a way to use recycled tyres in concrete. By adding recycled tyres and other waste materials to concrete, they have made stronger and longer lasting concrete. This means the concrete is not only a better quality product, they're also removing waste and recycling a dangerous substance, removing it from landfill.

The Higg index looks at how materials are made, recycled, how much water they use and other things that have an impact on the environment. It also considers where the materials are made. Some countries will have different rules that can impact how much waste a company generates making materials. The Higg index developers applied five principles to understand how sustainable different fabrics are:  climate impact (how much heat this will add to the world's climate) water pollution (how much and what kind of pollution will go into waterways while making this fabric?) water use (some fabrics use a lot more water than others in production) use of fossil fuels (this includes products made of fossil fuels and ones that use fossil fuels for transport or when they are made) chemistry (what is the fabric made of? How will those chemicals breakdown and react after they are not wanted any more?)  Understanding the impact of different fabrics gives designers and companies a way to make more sustainable clothing. The Higg index has expanded since it was first developed. Now, companies can look at their impact from \"cradle-to-grave\" or from the raw materials they use to the waste after the product has finished. This lifecycle view looks at transportation, office spaces, suppliers, materials and much more to help companies find ways to be more sustainable. Note: the Higg index has been criticised for scoring fabric from fossil fuels too highly (nylon and other plastic based fabrics) and rating them more highly than natural fibres (leather, silk and others). In response to this criticism, the Index is not being used as a promotional or marketing tool by fashion brands, anymore.  Image attribution: Fotoschlick on Adobe Stock Beyond fashion The Higg index suite of tools measures the environmental impact of different materials in other industries too. Home textiles, shoes, fashion and other uses of fabric and materials can have the Higg Index applied to their products. \"Materials\" in this context means the parts that a product is made of. A shoe might be made from leather, plastic and rubber &mdash; these are the shoe's materials. Designers and developers can look at the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of materials to find options that are lower in carbon emissions.

In any electrical circuit the sum of all currents flowing into any point is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out of it. Example 1 If at any junction of three wires there is 2A flowing in on one wire and 3A flowing in on another, then there must be a current of 5A flowing out on the third. Sometimes this rule is abbreviated simply to 'the sum of all currents at a point is zero'. Remember that currents flowing into the point will be positive and those flowing away from the point negative. The total potential drop around a closed circuit must be equal to the total EMF in the circuit. Example 2 If we know that a torch battery supplies an EMF of 3.0V and we measure a 2.8V PD (potential difference) across the bulb, there must be a 0.2V drop somewhere else in the circuit \u2013 possibly across the switch contacts if they are a little dirty.

The EMF of the battery is therefore given by \\(EMF\\ =\\ V = V_1 +\\ V_2\\) For resistors in series the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances, or: \\(R_{EQ}=R_1+R_2\\) Where REQ is one resistance equivalent to the sum of R1 and R2. Given that the current I leaving the battery must flow through both R1 and R2, then the current flowing in a series circuit must always be the same, or: For resistors connected in series the same current must pass through each resistor. Example 3 Two pieces of nichrome wire (as used in heater elements) have resistances of 10&#8486; and 20&#8486;.  What current would flow through them, and what power will be produced in them, if they are separately connected to a 12V battery? If they are connected in series what is their total resistance? When placed in series across the 12V battery, what current will flow through them and what power will be produced?  Solution  The current will be given by \\(I= \\frac{V}{R}\\), so for the two wires separately the currents will be \\(\\frac{12}{10} = 1.2A\\), and \\(\\frac{12}{20} = 0.6A\\). The power is found from \\(P= \\frac{V}{I}\\) and so will be \\(\\frac{12}{1.2} = 14.4W\\) and \\(\\frac{12}{0.6} = 7.2W\\). When connected in series the total resistance will be \\(10 + 20 = 30&#8486;\\) The current that flows from the 12V battery will be \\(I= \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{12}{30} = 0.4A\\). The total power will be \\(\\frac{V}{I} = \\frac{12}{0.4} = 30W\\).  Exercise  Emily has found a point in her car where four wires are attached together. She finds currents of +2.5A and +1.0A in two of the wires, and -4.2A in a third ('+' means current into the point and '-' means current out of the point). What is the current in the fourth wire?

He decides that the simplest way to overcome the problem is to wire them in series.  Will the headlamps work correctly? Do you see any problems with this scheme?   Two equal resistors are placed in series and found to have a combined resistance of 34&#8486;. What is the resistance of each one? A 10V power supply is used across two separate resistors. The current through one is found to be 0.4A, and through the other 0.5A. When they are combined in series, what current (in mA) will flow through them and what is their effective resistance? A 400&#8486; resistor and a 100&#8486; resistor are placed in series across a battery with an EMF of 5V.  How much current will flow from the battery? Give your answer in mA.

An index can be an integer \u2013 a counting number - either positive or negative. An index can also be a fraction such as \u00bd, \u00be, or 2.5. Read this section to see what this means, and how the laws of indices apply to fractional indices. In another module, the index laws were introduced and example were given of their application. The actual indices were whole numbers. But the index laws also work with fractional indices. In this module we introduce fractional indices and give some meaning to numbers and expressions like \\(3^{1\/3}\\)or \\(x^{1\/2}\\).  Index Laws Remember the basic index laws:  \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{m}\\div a^{n}=a^{m-n}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{mn}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{0}=1\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{-n}=\\frac{1}{a^{n}}\\)  These hold when \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are whole numbers or fractions. In what follows, we will refer to these as the first index law, the second index law etc.   Fractional Indices What meaning can we give to \\(3^{1\/2}.\\) Using the first index law, we find: \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{1\/2}\\times3^{1\/2} &amp; =3^{1\/2+1\/2}\\\\ &amp; =3^{1}\\\\ &amp; =3. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(3^{1\/2}\\) is the number that when multiplied by itself, gives three. But the square root of \\(3\\) is the number that when multiplied by itself gives \\(3.\\) That is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3} &amp; =3. \\end{align*}\\] Since \\(3^{1\/2}\\) behaves like \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) we say \\[ 3^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{3}. \\] Consider now \\(2^{1\/3}\\). Using the first index law, we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{1\/3}\\times2^{1\/3}\\times2^{1\/3} &amp; =2^{1\/3+1\/3+1\/3}\\\\ &amp; =2^{1}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(2^{1\/3}\\) behave like the cube root of \\(2.\\) That is, \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{1\/3} &amp; =\\sqrt[3]{2} \\end{align*}\\]   In general we say that \\(a^{1\/n}\\) is the \\(n^{th}\\) root of \\(a.\\) That is \\[ a^{1\/n}=\\sqrt[n]{a} \\] for any positive integer \\(n\\) (whole numbers like \\(1,2,\\ldots\\) ).    Examples  \\(\\qquad4^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{4}=2.\\) \\(\\qquad27^{1\/3}=\\sqrt[3]{27}=3.\\) \\(\\qquad3^{1\/4}=\\sqrt[4]{3}.\\) \\(\\qquad b^{1\/5}=\\sqrt[5]{b}.\\) \\(\\qquad x^{1\/2}=\\sqrt{x}.\\) \\(\\qquad32^{-1\/5}=\\frac{1}{32^{1\/5}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[5]{32}}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\)  In most cases the root of a number will not be able to be written as a whole number or fraction and will be an irrational number. For example \\(\\sqrt{2}=1.41421356\\ldots\\). For some practice, please do Exercise 1    Exercise 1 Evaluate the following expressions. If the answer is not exact, use a calculator to give a decimal approximation to two decimal places. a)\\(\\;64^{1\/2}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\) b) \\(\\;125^{1\/3}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\)c) \\(\\;36^{1\/4}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\)d) \\(\\;81^{-1\/2}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\)e) \\(\\;128^{-1\/7}\\) \\(\\quad\\quad\\)f) \\(\\;250^{1\/5}\\)        More Complicated Fractional Indices In this section, we introduce terms like \\(a^{2\/3}\\). Using the third index law1 The third law is: \\(\\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{mn}\\) we have: \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2\/3} &amp; =\\left(a^{2}\\right)^{1\/3}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}\\quad\\textrm{using the definition of indices as roots.} \\end{align*}\\] Again using the third index law:2 We use the commutative law: \\[\\begin{align*} mn &amp; =m\\times n\\\\ &amp; =n\\times m\\\\ &amp; =nm. \\end{align*}\\] In our case, we are using the fact that \\(2\\times\\left(1\/3\\right)=\\left(1\/3\\right)\\times2.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2\/3} &amp; =a^{2\\times\\left(1\/3\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =a^{\\left(1\/3\\right)\\times2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\sqrt[3]{a}\\right)^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]   In general, \\[\\begin{align*} a^{p\/q} &amp; =\\sqrt[q]{a^{p}} \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} a^{p\/q} &amp; =\\left(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\right)^{p} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are integers with \\(q\\neq0.\\)    Examples  \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\)=\\(\\sqrt[4]{5^{3}}\\)or \\(\\left(\\sqrt[4]{5}\\right)^{3}\\). \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(7^{5\/2}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{7^{5}}\\) = \\(\\left(\\sqrt{7}\\right)^{5}\\). \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(a^{7\/5}\\) = \\(\\sqrt[5]{a^{7}}\\)= \\(\\left(\\sqrt[5]{a}\\right)^{7}\\). \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(y^{-\\frac{3}{4}}\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{y^{\\frac{3}{4}}}\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{y^{3}}}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{\\left(\\sqrt[4]{y}\\right)^{3}}\\) .  Using the fifth index law: The fifth law is \\(a^{-n}=\\frac{1}{a^{n}}\\).  \\(\\quad\\quad\\) \\(\\sqrt[4]{x^{3}}=x^{3\/4}.\\)     Simplification of Expressions The index laws may be used to simplify algebraic expressions as shown in the following examples. Note that you don\u2019t have to put in the lines of text explaining each step.  Simplify \\(\\left(x^{3}y^{9}\\right)^{2\/3}.\\) Solution:  The third index law is: \\[ \\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{mn} \\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}y^{9}\\right)^{2\/3} &amp; =x^{3\\times\\left(2\/3\\right)}y^{9\\times\\left(2\/3\\right)}\\quad\\textrm{using the third law,}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}y^{6}. \\end{align*}\\]  Simplify \\(3^{1\/3}\\div3^{4\/3}.\\) Solution:  The second index law is: \\[ a^{m}\\div a^{n}=a^{m-n}. \\] \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{1\/3}\\div3^{4\/3} &amp; =3^{\\left(1\/3\\right)-\\left(4\/3\\right)}\\quad\\textrm{using the second index law,}\\\\ &amp; =3^{-\\left(3\/3\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =3^{-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}. \\end{align*}\\]  Simplify \\(32^{3\/5}\\).

We've learned how to limit this to a section of the x axis. But what if you have an area that is bounded by limits on both the x and the y axes? You will need to integrate with respect to the x axis and then integrate with respect to the y axis as well.  Double Integrals is the method you will need. Read this worksheet for some examples and exercises. There are linear, exponential and trigonometric functions defining boundaries for shapes on the x-y axes.  A double integral is of the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\underset{R}{\\iint}f(x,y)\\:dA &amp; =\\underset{R}{\\iint}f(x,y)\\:dx\\:dy=\\underset{R}{\\iint}f(x,y)\\:dy\\:dx \\end{align*}\\] where  \\(z=f(x,y)\\) is a continuous function on the region \\(R\\); \\(R\\) is a region of integration in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane; \\(dA\\) is an infinitesimal element of area in \\(R\\) and \\(dA=dx\\:dy=dy\\:dx\\). If \\(f(x,y)\\geq0\\) then the double integral is equal to the volume below the surface \\(f(x,y)\\) and above the region \\(R\\).    Evaluation A double integral may be evaluated in two ways:  Integrating first with respect to \\(x\\), keeping \\(y\\) constant. If \\(a\\leq x\\leq b\\) and \\(c\\leq y\\leq d\\) , the integral becomes \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}f(x,y)\\:dA=\\int_{c}^{d}\\left[\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y)\\:dx\\right]\\:dy\\) . The \u201cinner\u201d integral is the integral with respect to \\(x\\) and the \u201couter\u201d integral is the integral with respect to \\(y\\) . Integrating first with respect to \\(y\\), keeping \\(x\\) constant, with \\(a\\leq y\\leq b\\) and \\(c\\leq x\\leq d\\) . The integral becomes \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}f(x,y)\\:dA=\\int_{c}^{d}\\left[\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y)\\:dy\\right]\\:dx\\) . The \u201cinner\u201d integral is the integral with respect to \\(y\\) and the \u201couter\u201d integral is the integral with respect to \\(x\\) . In practice integrating first with respect to \\(x\\) (or \\(y\\)) may be easier than integrating first with \\(y\\) (or \\(x\\)).  To evaluate a double integral it is helpful to:  Sketch the region of integration; Determine the limits of integration; Work out the inner integral, then Evaluate the outer integral.    Double Integrals Over a Rectangular Region The easiest case is when the region is a rectangle.  Example 1 Evaluate \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(3x^{2}-2xy)\\:dx\\:dy\\) where \\(R\\) is the rectangle with vertices \\((2,1),\\) \\((2,3),\\) \\((4,1),\\) \\((4,3)\\) . Solution The region is shown below.  The limits of integration for the inner integral are \\(x=2\\) to \\(x=4\\) . The limits of integration for the outer integral are \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=3\\) . Thus, the integral becomes: \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\int_{2}^{4}(3x^{2}-2xy)\\:dx\\right]\\:dy\\) First, we work out the inner integral, integrating with respect to \\(x\\) while treating \\(y\\) as a constant. Then integrate with respect to \\(y\\) and evaluate. \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\int_{2}^{4}(3x^{2}-2xy)\\:dx\\right]\\:dy &amp; =\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\left(\\frac{3x^{3}}{3}-\\frac{2x^{2}y}{2}\\right)_{2}^{4}\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}y\\right)_{2}^{4}\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\left(4^{3}-4^{2}y\\right)-\\left(2^{3}-2^{2}y\\right)\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[\\left(64-16y\\right)-\\left(8-4y\\right)\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{1}^{3}\\left[56-12y\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\left[56y-\\frac{12y^{2}}{2}\\right]_{1}^{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\left[56y-6y^{2}\\right]_{1}^{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(56(3)-6(3)^{2}\\right)-\\left(56(1)-6(1)^{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =168-54-56+6\\\\ &amp; =64 \\end{align*}\\] In this example you could reverse the order of integration and still obtain the same answer.   Example 2: Reversing the Order of Integration in Example 1 Solution In this case, the integral becomes: \\(\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\int_{1}^{3}(3x^{2}-2xy)\\:dy\\right]\\:dx\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\int_{1}^{3}(3x^{2}-2xy)\\:dy\\right]\\:dx &amp; =\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\left(3x^{2}y-2x\\frac{y^{2}}{2}\\right)_{1}^{3}\\right]\\:dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\left(3x^{2}y-xy^{2}\\right)_{1}^{3}\\right]\\:dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\left(3x^{2}(3)-x(3)^{2}\\right)-\\left(3x^{2}(1)-x(1)^{2}\\right)\\right]\\:dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[\\left(9x^{2}-9x\\right)-\\left(3x^{2}-x\\right)\\right]\\:dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{2}^{4}\\left[6x^{2}-8x\\right]\\:dx\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\frac{6x^{3}}{3}-\\frac{8x^{2}}{2}\\right]_{2}^{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\left[2x^{3}-4x^{2}\\right]_{2}^{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(2(4)^{3}-4(4)^{2}\\right)-\\left(2(2)^{3}-4(2)^{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =128-64-16+16\\\\ &amp; =64 \\end{align*}\\] As expected the same answer is obtained regardless of the order of integration (provided that the function is continuous over the region of integration).    Exercise 1  Evaluate \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(4xy)\\:dx\\:dy\\) where \\(R\\) is the rectangle with vertices \\((0,1),\\) \\((0,3),\\) \\((3,1),\\) \\((3,3)\\) . Evaluate \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(6e^{x}+e^{y})\\:dy\\:dx\\) where \\(R\\) is the region bounded by the lines \\(x=0,\\) \\(x=4,\\) \\(y=1,\\) \\(y=2\\) . Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{1}^{4}(\\sin\\pi x+\\cos\\pi y)\\:dy\\:dx\\) Find \\(\\int_{0}^{b}\\int_{0}^{a}(5)\\:dx\\:dy\\) . What is the physical significance of this result?       Double Integrals Over a General Region For a general region of integration the limits of integration are not necessarily constants. Frequently they are functions. It is important to be able to sketch the region to identify the limits of integration.  Example 3 Evaluate \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(10x-4y+5)\\:dx\\:dy\\) where \\(R\\) is the region bounded by the curve \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) and the \\(x\\)- axis, from \\(x=0\\) to \\(x=1\\) .  Solution Firstly, sketch the region of integration on the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) plane.  Secondly, find the limits of integration. The \u201cinner\u201d integration is with respect to \\(x\\) , so we draw an arrow across the region of integration, parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis (keeping \\(y\\) constant) from left to right. The left boundary is \\(x=y^{2}\\) (making \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\)). The right boundary is \\(x=1\\) . These are the limits of integration for \\(x\\) . The outer integration is with respect to \\(y\\). The limits of integration are simply the lower and upper limits of \\(y\\) for the region of integration. Lower limit: \\(y=0\\) Upper limit: \\(y=1\\) Therefore the integral becomes, \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\int_{x=y^{2}}^{1}(10x-4y+5)\\:dx\\right]\\:dy\\) Thirdly, integrate with respect to \\(x\\) and then with respect to \\(y\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\int_{x=y^{2}}^{1}(10x-4y+5)\\:dx\\right]\\:dy &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\left(5x^{2}-4yx+5x\\right)_{x=y^{2}}^{1}\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\left(5(1)^{2}-4y(1)+5(1)\\right)-\\left(5(y^{2})^{2}-4y(y^{2})+5(y^{2})\\right)\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\left(5-4y+5\\right)-\\left(5y^{4}-4y^{3}+5y^{2}\\right)\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[-5y^{4}+4y^{3}-5y^{2}-4y+10\\right]\\:dy\\\\ &amp; =\\left[-y^{5}+y^{4}-\\frac{5y^{3}}{3}-2y^{2}+10y\\right]_{0}^{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(-(1)^{5}+(1)^{4}-\\frac{5(1)^{3}}{3}-2(1)^{2}+10(1)\\right)-\\left(0\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-1+1-\\frac{5}{3}-2+10\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{19}{3}\\textrm{ or $6\\frac{1}{3}.$ } \\end{align*}\\] The same answer could be found by reversing the order of integration and evaluating the double integral \\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(10x-4y+5)\\:dy\\:dx\\).   Example 4: Reversing the Order of Integration in Example 3. Solution Firstly sketch the region of integration.  Secondly, find the limits of integration. The \u201cinner\u201d integration is with respect to \\(y\\) , so we draw an arrow across the region of integration, parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis (keeping \\(x\\) constant) from bottom to top. The lower boundary is \\(y=0\\) The upper boundary is \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) . These are the limits of integration for \\(y\\) . The outer integration is with respect to \\(x\\). The limits of integration are simply the left and right limits of \\(x\\) for the region of integration. Left limit: \\(x=0\\) Right limit: \\(x=1\\) Therefore the integral becomes, \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\int_{0}^{y=\\sqrt{x}}(10x-4y+5)\\:dy\\right]\\:dx\\) Thirdly, integrate with respect to \\(y\\) and then with respect to \\(x\\). (You can check this yourself and see that you get the same answer, regardless of the order of integration).   Example 5 Determine the limits of integration for\\(\\underset{R}{\\iint}(2xy)\\:dA\\) over the region shown below,  by a) integrating with respect to \\(x\\) first and b) integrating with respect to \\(y\\) first. Solution a) Integrating with respect to \\(x\\) first. We draw an arrow parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis.  Looking at this arrow, it can be seen that the left limit is \\(x=-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(y-4\\right)\\) (this is found by re-arranging the equation \\(y=-3x+4\\)) and the right limit is \\(x=y\\). The \\(y\\)-limits are the lower and upper values of \\(y\\). Lower limit, \\(y=1\\) and the upper limit is \\(y=4\\). Therefore, the integral becomes \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\left[\\int_{x=-\\frac{1}{3}(y-4)}^{x=y}(2xy)\\:dx\\right]\\ dy\\) Solution b) Integrating with respect to \\(y\\) first. In this case we need to divide the region in two and draw two lines parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis.  The diagram shows that, although the upper limit is always \\(y=4\\), the lower limit changes from \\(y=-3x+4\\) (between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1)\\), to \\(y=x\\) (from \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=4\\)). This gives two double integrals that must be added together to cover the entire region. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\int_{y=-3+4}^{y=4}(2xy)\\:dy\\right]\\ dx+\\int_{1}^{4}\\left[\\int_{y=x}^{y=4}(2xy)\\:dy\\right]\\ dx\\) In this case it appears that integrating with respect to \\(x\\) first is the easier option. In fact, sometimes one order may be impossible, but if the order of integration is reversed then the double integral can be evaluated.

This reflects the product rule in differentiation and is applicable to logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and algebraic functions. Integration by parts is a technique for integrating the product of two functions. For example: \\[ \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx \\] where the functions are \\(x\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) or \\[ \\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx \\] where the functions are \\(x^{3}\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\). This module gives some information on using this technique.  Formula The integration by parts formula is obtained from the product rule for differentiation. For any two differentiable functions \\(v\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)\\) we have, by the product rule, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right) &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrating both sides with respect to \\(x\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}\\right)dx,\\;\\textrm{that is,}\\\\ v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx+\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] This can be rearranged to give the formula for integration by parts: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)-\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] Which is often abbreviated to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] The hope is that by choosing the functions \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) carefully, the integral on the right hand side is easier than the original integral. Successful use of integration by parts requires a correct choice for \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\). If the integral on the right is harder, then try swapping \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\). To assist you in choosing \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) choose \\(v\\) to be the function that comes first in the sequence of functions:  logarithmic function inverse trig function algebraic function trigonometric function exponential function  \\(u'\\) is then the other function in the integrand. 1 The integrand is the function that is being integrated. For example the integrand in \\[ \\int x\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx \\] is \\(x\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). In this case it is the product of an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) so we would set \\(v=x\\), (because algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions), and \\(u'=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\).  Example 1: Find \\(\\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx\\). Here we have an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Since algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions, we let \\(v=x\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\\) and \\(u=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). Using the formula we have: 2 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] and the fact that \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\).  \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\left(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\cdot1dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)+\\cos\\left(x\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant.} \\end{align*}\\] Note that if we chose the functions as \\(v=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u'=x\\), then \\(v'=-\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}.\\) Substituting in the formula will give: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right is harder than the one we began with and we make no progress. If this happens to you, change the selection.   Example 2: Find \\(\\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx\\). Here we have an algebraic function \\(x^{3}\\) and a logarithmic function \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\). Since logarithmic functions are higher on the list than algebraic functions, we let \\(v=\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=x^{3}\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\/x\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\). Using the formula we have 3 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\right)-\\int\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\int x^{3}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}+c\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)}{4}-\\frac{x^{4}}{16}+c. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 3: Find \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx.\\) We apparently have only one function \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\). The trick here is to note that the integrand 4 The integrand is the function that is integrated. In this case it is \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) which is the same as \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\). can always be multiplied by \\(1\\) without change. So instead of seeing \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx.\\) We see \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1dx.\\) We can view \\(1\\) as the constant value function.5 The constant value function \\(1\\) is just a function that gives the value \\(1\\) regardless of its argument. That is \\(1\\left(x\\right)=1\\) for all \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) The constant value function is algebraic, \\(\\left(1=x^{0}\\right)\\) and below an inverse trigonometric function like \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) on the list above. So we set \\(v=\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=1,\\) then \\(dv\/dx=1\/\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and \\(u=x.\\) Substituting in the formula we get:6 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx. &amp; (1) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side can be evaluated with the substitution \\(w=1-x^{2}\\) then \\(dw\/dx=-2x\\) and \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\), using the substitution rule7 The substitution rule states \\[ \\int f\\left(g\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\frac{dg}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(w\\right)dw \\] where \\(w=g\\left(x\\right)\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx &amp; =\\int-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w}}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\int w^{-1\/2}dw\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2\\right)w^{1\/2}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)^{1\/2}+c\\\\ &amp; =-\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this result in equation (1) we get the final result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx.\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\]    Repeated Use of Integration by Parts Some integrals require the use of the integration by parts technique more than once. For example, consider \\(\\int x^{2}e^{x}dx\\). We have an algebraic function \\(x^{2}\\) multiplying an exponential function \\(e^{x}.\\) According to our guide we set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2x\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula we get: 8 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx. &amp; (2) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side requires another integration by parts. We set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=2x\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx &amp; =2xe^{x}-\\int2e^{x}dx\\\\ &amp; =2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}. &amp; (3) \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute this result in equation (2) to get the result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\left(2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c\\right)\\;\\textrm{using ($3$ )}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-2xe^{x}+2e^{x}-c\\\\ &amp; =e^{x}\\left(x^{2}-2x+2\\right)-c. \\end{align*}\\] Note that it doesn\u2019t matter if we put \\(c\\) or \\(-c\\) as \\(c\\) is just any constant.

Integrating using partial fractions helps you to solve this problem. Read this worksheet for several worked examples.  Some times a complex function may be integrated by breaking it up into partial fractions. The idea is that each partial fraction is an easier integral than the original. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int &amp; \\frac{1}{x^{2}+5x+6}dx=\\int\\frac{1}{x+2}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x+3}dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integrals on the right are much simpler than that on the left. This module explains how this can be done.  Adding Fractions When adding fractions we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator and then add the numerators.1 The numerator is the top line of the fraction and the denominator is the bottom line. For \\(\\frac{2}{x+2}\\), the numerator is \\(2\\) and the denominator is \\(x+2.\\) For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3}{3x+4}+\\frac{2}{x-5} &amp; =\\frac{3}{3x+4}\\times\\frac{x-5}{x-5}+\\frac{2}{x-5}\\times\\frac{3x+4}{3x+4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3x-15}{\\left(3x+4\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}+\\frac{6x+8}{\\left(3x+4\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3x-15+6x+8}{\\left(3x+4\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9x-7}{\\left(3x+4\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\]   Finding Partial Fractions To find partial fractions, we do the reverse of what we did when adding fractions above. In other words we want to go from \\[ \\underbrace{\\frac{9x-7}{\\left(3x+4\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}}_{\\textrm{algebraic fraction}}\\quad\\textrm{to$\\quad$ $\\underbrace{\\frac{3}{3x+4}+\\frac{2}{x-5}}_{\\textrm{partial fractions}}$ }. \\] The first step in finding partial fractions is to factorize the denominator. The factorization used will depend on the form of the original fraction\u2019s s denominator. We summarize this below. Note that \\(a,b,c,k,m,n,p\\) and \\(q\\) are constants that are known and \\(A,A_{i}\\) \\(\\left(i\\in\\left\\{ 1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\} \\right),B\\) and \\(C\\) are constants that you have to determine. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two distinct linear factors: \\[ \\frac{mx+k}{\\left(x-a\\right)\\left(x-b\\right)}\\quad\\textrm{factorize using$\\quad\\frac{A}{x-a}+\\frac{B}{x-b}$ }. \\] 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repeated linear factors: \\[ \\frac{mx+k}{\\left(x-a\\right)^{n}}\\quad\\textrm{factorize using$\\quad\\frac{A_{1}}{x-a}+\\frac{A_{2}}{\\left(x-b\\right)^{2}}+\\ldots+\\frac{A_{n-1}}{\\left(x-b\\right)^{n-1}}+\\frac{A_{n}}{\\left(x-b\\right)^{n}}.$ } \\] 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linear factor and irreducible quadratic factor: \\[ \\frac{mx+k}{\\left(px+q\\right)\\left(ax^{2}+bx+c\\right)}\\quad\\textrm{factorize using$\\quad\\frac{A}{px+q}+\\frac{Bx+C}{ax^{2}+bx+c}$ }. \\]  To express an algebraic fraction as partial fractions:  Factorize the denominator (using the guidelines above); Write the algebraic fraction in partial fraction form with unknown constants \\(A,A_{i},B\\) and \\(C\\); Add the partial fractions; Equate coefficients, or substitute values of \\(x\\) to determine the value of the unknown constants.     Using Partial Fractions in Integration To integrate a function that is an algebraic fraction that is too hard to integrate directly we first convert it into partial fraction form and integrate each of the partial fractions.  Example 1: Find the integral of \\(\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\) with respect to \\(x\\). Solution: We first decompose the integrand into partial fractions. Since \\(x^{2}+2x-3=\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\), we are dealing with the case where the denominator has two distinct linear factors. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] Now we have to determine the constants \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\) First add the partial fractions. We do this by finding a common denominator, in this case \\(\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right):\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1} &amp; =\\frac{A}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x-1\\right)}{\\left(x-1\\right)}+\\frac{B}{\\left(x-1\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A\\left(x-1\\right)+B\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax-A+Bx+3B}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax+Bx-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(A+B\\right)x-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3} \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{\\overbrace{\\left(A+B\\right)}^{x-\\textrm{coefficient}}x\\overbrace{-A+3B}^{\\textrm{constant term}}}{x^{2}+2x-3}. \\end{align*}\\] The constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be found by equating the coefficients of terms on the left and right sides of the equation. On the left, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\) and on the right the coefficient is \\(A+B\\) . Similarly the constant term on the left side is \\(-5\\) and on the right it is \\(-A+3B\\). This gives us the following simultaneous equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -A+3B &amp; =-5 &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These equations are easily solved by elimination. Adding the equations we get \\[\\begin{align*} 4B &amp; =-4\\\\ B &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting for \\(B\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} A-1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Finally we have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}+\\frac{-1}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] We can now evaluate the integral \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{2}{x+3}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x-1}dx\\\\ &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ,c\\textrm{ being a constant. } \\end{align*}\\] Using the laws of logarithms, \\(a\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\ln\\left(x^{a}\\right)\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(a\\right)-\\ln\\left(b\\right)=\\ln\\frac{a}{b}\\) , we can also write the answer as: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ c\\textrm{ being a constant. }\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}}{\\left|x-1\\right|}+c \\end{align*}\\]   Example 2: Find the integral of \\(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}.\\) We first factorize the denominator: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5 &amp; =x^{2}\\left(x-5\\right)+x-5\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right). \\end{align*}\\] In this case we have a quadratic factor and a linear factor. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x+5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(Ax+B\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}+\\frac{C\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax^{2}-5Ax+Bx-5B+Cx^{2}+C}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x+5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(A+C\\right)x^{2}+\\left(-5A+B\\right)x-5B+C \\end{align*}\\] Equating coefficients of \\(x^{2}\\), \\(x\\) and the constant gives the three equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+C &amp; =1 &amp; &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -5A+B &amp; =-3 &amp; &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ -5B+C &amp; =16. &amp; &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] which may be solved simultaneously as follows. Multiply \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(5\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 5A+5C &amp; =5 &amp; &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and add equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} B+5C &amp; =-3+5\\\\ &amp; =2\\\\ 5B+25C &amp; =10\\;\\textrm{\\;multiplying by $5$ .} &amp; &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding equation \\(\\left(5\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} 26C &amp; =26\\\\ C &amp; =1. &amp; &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) into \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} A+1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =0. &amp; &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Finally substituting \\(A=0\\) in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =-3. &amp; &amp; \\left(8\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Therefore the partial fraction decomposition is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x-5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}. \\end{align*}\\] We can now do the integral: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}\\right)dx\\;\\;\\textrm{using partial fractions}\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{x-5}dx-3\\int\\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left|x-5\\right|-3\\tan^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+c,\\ \\ \\;c\\textrm{ being a constant.} \\end{align*}\\]    Important Note The process of finding partial fractions can only be performed on fractions where the degree of the denominator of the algebraic fraction is greater than that of the numerator. If necessary, divide the denominator into the numerator then express the remaining fractional part as partial fractions. For example, the numerator and denominator of \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} \\end{align*}\\] are of degree \\(2\\). So before finding partial fractions we would divide the numerator by the denominator to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} &amp; =1+\\frac{4x+5}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The fraction at right can then be changed into partial fractions to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} &amp; =1+\\frac{1}{x+1}+\\frac{3}{x+2}. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises  Rewrite each of the following in the appropriate generalized partial fractions form. Do not calculate the constants. For example \\(\\frac{x}{x^{2}-1}=\\frac{x}{\\left(x-1\\right)\\left(x+1\\right)}=\\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{x+1}\\).  \\[\\begin{array}{llll} a) \\frac{x+6}{x^{2}-5x+6} &amp; b) \\frac{3}{\\left(x^{2}+3\\right)\\left(x+1\\right)} &amp; c) \\frac{2x}{x^{2}+8x+16} &amp; d) \\frac{x^{2}}{\\left(x-1\\right)\\left(x+1\\right)}\\\\ \\end{array}\\]  Express the following as partial fractions:  \\[\\begin{array}{llll} a) \\frac{x+2}{2x^{2}+5x-12} &amp; b) \\frac{3}{x^{2}-2x+1} &amp; c) \\frac{x^{2}-2x+2}{x^{3}+x^{2}+x} &amp; d) \\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}-4}\\\\ \\end{array}\\]  Perform the following integrations:  \\[\\begin{array}{lll} a) \\int\\frac{4x+9}{x^{2}+x-12}dx &amp; b) \\int\\frac{21-8x}{x^{2}-x-6}dx &amp; c) \\int\\frac{5x^{2}-5x+2}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)^{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\]      Download this page, IN7 Integration Using Partial Fractions (PDF 238 KB)   What's next...

You can simplify this by substituting a single pronumeral (say u) to represent one of the functions. The substitution rule for integration is like the chain rule for differentiation: it breaks a complex expression into manageable parts.  Under some circumstances, it is possible to use the substitution method to carry out an integration. The idea is to make a substitution that makes the original integral easier. Generally, if some part of the integrand is a derivative of another part multiplied by a constant, substitution may be useful. 1 The integrand of an integral is the function being integrated. For example the integrand of the integral \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] is \\(2x\\cos x^{2}\\).  Integration by Substitution The basic rule is:   If \\(u=g\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(\\frac{du}{dx}=g'\\left(x\\right)\\) then \\[ \\int f\\left(g\\left(x\\right)\\right)g'\\left(x\\right)dx=\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\] This may also be written: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\end{align*}\\]   A simple test may be used to see if substitution is useful. Look at the integrand2 The integrand of an integral is the function being integrated. For example the integrand of the integral \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] is \\(2x\\cos x^{2}\\). and see if one part of it is the derivative of another part multiplied by a constant. If so, substitution may be helpful. For example consider \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx. \\] Note that the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\) and so one part is the derivative of another part and substitution can be used. Even if we have the integral \\[ \\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\). Since \\(x\\) is 1\/2 of the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\), substitution is still possible.  Example 1: Calculate \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx.\\) Solution: In this solution we use the second form of the substitution rule.3 \\[ \\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\] Let \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)=\\cos\\left(u\\right)=f\\left(u\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=2x\\). Substituting these in the integral gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{du}{dx}\\cos\\left(u\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int f\\left(u\\right)du\\quad\\textrm{using the substitution rule}\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\cos\\left(u\\right)du\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(u\\right)+c+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x^{2}\\right)+c. \\end{align*}\\] Note that our choice of \\(u=x^{2}\\) was based on the fact that the derivative is \\(2x\\) which is part of the integrand.   Example 2: Calculate \\(\\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx.\\) Solution: Again set \\(u=x^{2}\\) because \\(du\/dx=2x\\) and so \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\). As in the first example, \\(\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)=\\cos\\left(u\\right)=f\\left(u\\right)\\) and substituting in the integral we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\cos\\left(u\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int f\\left(u\\right)du\\quad\\textrm{using the substitution rule}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\cos\\left(u\\right)du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\left(u\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\left(x^{2}\\right)+c \\end{align*}\\]   Example 3: Find \\(\\int\\left(8x-5\\right)^{9}dx\\). Solution: We set \\(u=8x-9\\) then \\(du\/dx=8\\) so 1=\\(\\frac{1}{8}du\/dx\\) and \\(\\left(8x-5\\right)^{9}=u^{9}=f\\left(u\\right)\\). Substituting in the integral we get4 Note that \\(\\left(8x-5\\right)^{9}=1\\times\\left(8x-5\\right)^{9}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(8x-5\\right)^{9}dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{du}{dx}u^{9}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{du}{dx}f\\left(u\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{8}\\int f\\left(u\\right)du\\quad\\textrm{using the substitution rule}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{8}\\int u^{9}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{1}{10}u^{10}+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{80}\\left(8x-5\\right)^{10}+c. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 4: Find \\(\\int x\\left(x^{2}+2\\right)^{3}dx.\\) Solution: We set \\(u=x^{2}+2\\) because the derivative \\(du\/dx=2x\\) and \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\). Then \\(\\left(x^{2}+2\\right)^{3}=u^{3}=f\\left(u\\right)\\) and the integral becomes \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\left(x^{2}+2\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}u^{3}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int u^{3}\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int u^{3}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{4}u^{4}+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{8}\\left(x^{2}+4\\right)^{4}+c. \\end{align*}\\] Note in this example we did not put in the steps involving \\(f\\left(u\\right)\\) as done previously. These steps are not required and were put in to clarify the use of the substitution rule.   Example 5: Find \\(\\int x^{2}e^{4-x^{3}}dx.\\) Solution: We set \\(u=4-x^{3}\\) because \\(du\/dx=-3x^{2}\\) which is \\(-3\\) times the other part of the integrand. So \\(x^{2}=-\\frac{1}{3}du\/dx.\\)Substituting, the integral is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{4-x^{3}}dx &amp; =\\int\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}e^{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}\\int e^{u}\\frac{du}{dx}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}\\int e^{u}du\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}e^{u}+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3}e^{4-x^{3}}+c. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 6: Find \\(\\int\\frac{x^{4}}{1+x^{5}}dx.\\) Solution: Let \\(u=1+x^{5}\\) then \\(du\/dx=5x^{4}\\) and \\(x^{4}=\\frac{1}{5}du\/dx\\). Substituting in the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x^{4}}{1+x^{5}}dx &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{5}du\/dx\\frac{1}{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\int du\/dx\\frac{1}{u}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\int\\frac{1}{u}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\ln\\left|u\\right|+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\ln\\left|1+x^{5}\\right|+c. \\end{align*}\\]    Definite integrals The method of substitution may also be used to evaluate definite integrals but you need to be careful with the limits of integration when you change the variable of integration. For example suppose we want to evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx\\). We set \\(u=2x+1\\)5 We will use the fact that \\[ \\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}=1\\times\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}. \\] then \\(du\/dx=2\\)and so \\(1=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\). Note that when \\(x=0,\\) \\(u=1\\) and when \\(x=1,\\) \\(u=3.\\) Substituting into the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}1.\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}.u^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{1}^{3}u^{5}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{6}\\left[u^{6}\\right]_{u=1}^{u=3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(3^{6}-1^{6}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(729-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{728}{12}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{182}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the change of limits on the integration in line 3 as we are now integrating with respect to \\(u.\\)   Alternative Notation In many texts and possibly your lecture notes, you will find a slight change in notation. For example, consider the integral of Example 1 above: \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx.\\) As before we set \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(du\/dx=2x\\). The alternative notation then rearranges this to give \\(dx=\\frac{1}{2x}du\\). Then substituting for \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(dx\\) in the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int2x\\cos\\left(u\\right)\\frac{1}{2x}du\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\cos\\left(u\\right)du\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(u\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x^{2}\\right)+c. \\end{align*}\\] This method gives the same result and will always work. However, you should realize that \\(du\/dx\\) is not a fraction6 The derivative \\(du\/dx\\) is not a fraction. Remember that the derivative of a function \\(u\\left(x\\right)\\)is defined by the limit: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{du}{dx} &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{u\\left(x+h\\right)-u\\left(x\\right)}{h}. \\end{align*}\\] and you have no right to treat it like one when you rewrite \\(du\/dx\\) as \\(dx=\\frac{1}{2x}du\\).   Exercises Find the following:  \\(\\int\\left(5x+1\\right)^{4}dx\\) \\(\\int3x^{2}\\left(x^{3}+2\\right)^{5}dx\\) \\(\\int\\left(2x+1\\right)\\left(x^{2}+x+3\\right)^{3}dx\\) \\(\\int6x^{2}\\sqrt{\\left(x^{3}+3\\right)}dx\\) \\(\\int\\sin\\left(3x+2\\right)dx\\) \\(\\int6x^{2}e^{x^{3}}dx\\) \\(\\int\\frac{2x}{2+x^{2}}dx\\)       Download this page, IN6:Integration by Substitution (PDF 164 KB)   What's next...

But sections might also be below the axis (and therefore negative). Read this worksheet to see how to deal with finding the integral for sections of graph which go above and below the x-axis (horizontal axis).  This module deals with the problem of finding the area between a curve and the x-axis.  Determining the Area Under a Curve For a curve defined by \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) the definite integral \\[ \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx \\] gives a signed measure of the area bordered by the lines \\(x=a\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=0\\) and the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\).1 Note that the line \\(y=0\\) is the \\(x\\)-axis. If \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\geq0\\) between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\) you would get a positive value for the definite integral as shown below.  If, \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\leq0\\) between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\) you would get a negative value for the definite integral as shown below.  Note that the area under a curve is always given as a positive number. The area is the absolute value of the signed areas: \\[ \\textrm{Area }=\\left|\\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx\\right|. \\] In the general case where \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) crosses the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the value of the definite integral may be positive or negative. However the area under the curve is always taken as the sum of the modulus of the signed areas. For example, the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\) is plotted below. The graph cuts the \\(x\\)-axis at -1, 0 and 2.  Note that the value of the definite integral from \\(x=-1\\) to \\(x=2\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{-1}^{2}\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\right)dx &amp; =\\left[\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x^{2}\\right]_{x=-1}^{x=2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}2^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}2^{3}-2^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\left(-1\\right)^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-1\\right)^{3}-\\left(-1\\right)^{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4-\\frac{8}{3}-4-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-2.25. \\end{align*}\\] But this is not the area. To calculate the area we need to evaluate two integrals. One from -1 to 0 (this is represented by the blue part of the graph) the other from 0 to 2 that represents the negative signed area. The actual area would then be the sum of the absolute value of these integrals. That is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Area} &amp; =\\left|\\int_{-1}^{0}\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\right)dx\\right|+\\left|\\int_{0}^{2}\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}-2x\\right)dx\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x^{2}\\right]_{x=-1}^{x=0}\\right|+\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x^{2}\\right]_{x=0}^{x=2}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|0-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\left(-1\\right)^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-1\\right)^{3}-\\left(-1\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right|+\\left|\\frac{1}{4}\\left(2\\right)^{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(2\\right)^{3}-2^{2}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right)\\right|+\\left|4-\\frac{8}{3}-4\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right|+\\frac{8}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{12}+\\frac{8}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{37}{12}\\;\\textrm{square units}. \\end{align*}\\]  Example 1 Given the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=4x-x^{2}\\) find the area between the graph of the function and the x-axis. Solution: The first step is to sketch the graph of the function. To do this we determine where the graph of the function cuts the x-axis. This gives us the limits of integration for the definite integral. Factorizing the function we see: \\[\\begin{align*} 4x-x^{2} &amp; =x\\left(4-x\\right). \\end{align*}\\] When the graph of the function cuts the x-axis, \\(x\\left(4-x\\right)=0\\) and so \\(x=0\\) or \\(x=4\\). That is the x-axis intercepts of the function are at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=4\\). At this point we need to graph the function as shown below:  We see the function is above the \\(x\\)-axis and so the area will be positive.2 Since the area is positive, we do not need the absolute value sign. The area is \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\int_{0}^{4}f\\left(x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{4}\\left(4x-x^{2}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\frac{4x^{2}}{2}-\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\right]_{x=0}^{x=4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4\\left(4\\right)^{2}}{2}-\\frac{\\left(4\\right)^{3}}{3}-\\left(\\frac{4\\left(0\\right)^{2}}{2}-\\frac{\\left(0\\right)^{3}}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{64}{2}-\\frac{64}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(64)-2(64)}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{64}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{32}{3}\\textrm{ square units}. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 2 Given the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1\\) find the area bounded by the curve, the \\(x\\)-axis and the lines \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\). As in the previous example we need to sketch the graph of the function and then consider the range of integration. Factorizing the function 3 We use \\(a^{2}-b^{2}=\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right).\\) This is an identity you should remember. \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-1 &amp; =\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x-1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] So the x- axis intercepts where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1=0\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\). At this point we need to graph the function as shown below:  We see the signed area will be negative as \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is below the axis between the points of integration. So we must use the modulus of the definite integral: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Area} &amp; =\\left|\\int_{-1}^{1}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)dx\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x\\right]_{x=-1}^{x=1}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{3}-1-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left(-1\\right)^{3}-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{3}-1-\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}+1\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{2}{3}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\frac{4}{3}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{3}\\;\\textrm{square units}. \\end{align*}\\]    Example 3. Given the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-1\\) find the area bounded by the curve, the \\(x\\)-axis and the lines \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\). This is the same function as in Example 2 above. First we graph the function:  As the function crosses the x-axis between 0 and 2, we will have to evaluate two integrals. The first from 0 to 1 and the second from 1 to 2. \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Area} &amp; =\\left|\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)dx\\right|+\\left|\\int_{1}^{2}\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)dx\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x\\right]_{x=0}^{x=1}\\right|+\\left|\\left[\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x\\right]_{x=1}^{x=2}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right|+\\left|\\frac{8}{3}-2-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}-1\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-\\frac{2}{3}\\right|+\\left|\\frac{8}{3}-\\frac{6}{3}-\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\\\ &amp; =2\\;\\textrm{square units}. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises  Find the area enclosed by the curve \\(y=6x-x^{2}\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis.

How do you integrate an exponential function? How do you integrate a trigonometric function?\n\nKeywords(tags): Integration, Maths\n\n\n\n  How do you integrate a logarithm? How do you integrate an exponential function? How do you integrate a trigonometric function? Read this worksheet to see how this is done.  This module looks at integrals such as \\(\\int\\frac{1}{x}dx\\) and\\(\\int\\frac{1}{3x-1}dx.\\)  The Power Rule for Integration One of the most important rules for integration is the power rule which says:1 Note that if \\(n=-1\\), \\({\\textstyle 1\/(n+1)}\\) would be \\({\\textstyle 1\/0}\\) which has no meaning. \\(n\\) can be any number (other than \\(-1\\)) - positive, negative or a fraction. Instead of saying c is a constant, we sometimes write \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) which means \\(c\\) is a real number.   Provided \\(n\\neq-1\\) then \\[ \\int x^{n}dx=\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant.   For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int xdx &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\int x^{2}dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\] The question is, \" How do we deal with the case when \\(n=-1\\). That is, how do we integrate \\(\\int\\left(1\/x\\right)dx\\,\\)? The answer is we define a new function as follows: \\[ \\int\\frac{1}{x}dx=\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c\\textrm{$\\quad\\textrm{where c is a constant.}$ } \\] This function, \\(\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|\\), is called the \u201cnatural logarithm\u201d. It is sometimes written as \\(\\textrm{ln$\\left|x\\right|$ }\\). Note the use of the absolute value sign. The natural logarithm is not defined for negative arguments. We can now integrate \\(f(x)=m\/x\\) where \\(m\\) is any constant: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{m}{x}dx &amp; =m\\int\\frac{1}{x}dx\\\\ &amp; =m\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c \\end{align*}\\] For example, the integral of \\(f(x)=\\frac{5}{x}\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\int\\frac{5}{x}dx=5\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) There is a more general rule which covers more cases. It is:   Let \\(a\\) , b and \\(m\\) be constants with \\(a\\neq0\\), then \\[ \\int\\frac{m}{ax+b}dx=\\frac{m}{a}\\log_{e}\\left|ax+b\\right|+c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant.     Examples  Integrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{2x}\\:\\)with respect to \\(x.\\;\\)2 Here, \\(m=1\\), \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=0\\). Solution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{1}{2x}dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] Calculate the integral \\(\\int\\frac{2}{3x}dx\\) \\(\\;\\,\\)3 Here, \\(m=2\\), \\(a=3\\) and \\(b=0\\). Solution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{2}{3x}dx &amp; =\\frac{2}{3}\\log_{e}\\left|3x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{13}{5x-7}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 4 Here, \\(m=13\\), \\(a=5\\) and \\(b=-7\\). Solution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{13}{5x-7}dx &amp; =\\frac{13}{5}\\textrm{ln}\\left|5x-7\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{6}{2-3x}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 5 Here, \\(m=6\\), \\(a=-3\\) and \\(b=2\\). Solution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{6}{2-3x}dx &amp; =\\frac{6}{-3}\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|+c. \\end{align*}\\] Integrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{6}{2-3x}-\\frac{2}{x+1}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 6 Here, \\(m=6\\), \\(a=-3\\) and \\(b=2\\) in the first term on the right hand side and \\(m=-2\\), \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\)in the second. Solution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(\\frac{6}{2-3x}-\\frac{2}{x+1}\\right)dx &amp; =\\frac{6}{-3}\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|-2\\log_{e}\\left|x+1\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|-2\\log_{e}\\left|x+1\\right|+c \\end{align*}\\]    Exercises  Calculate the following integrals  \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc} a) &amp; \\int\\frac{1}{5x}dx &amp; &amp; b) &amp; \\int\\frac{3}{2x}dx &amp; &amp; c) &amp; \\int\\frac{3}{3x-5}dx &amp; &amp; d) &amp; \\int\\frac{6}{2-7x}dx\\end{array} \\]  Integrate the following functions with respect to \\(x\\):  \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc} a) &amp; f(x)=x^{2}-2\/x &amp; &amp; b) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{1}{3x-2}+\\frac{3}{1-x} &amp; &amp; c) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{3}{3x-7}-x^{2} &amp; &amp; d) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{2}{5x-4}-\\frac{3}{2-5x}\\end{array} \\]      The Definite Integral Answers to all the integrals above were functions of \\(x\\) and involved a constant. Such integrals are called indefinite integrals or antiderivatives. They do not have a specific value. For a function \\(f(x)\\) suppose we can write an antiderivative \\(F(x)=\\int f(x)dx\\). We then define a definite integral of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) with respect to \\(x\\) using the notation:7 This is known as the first fundamental theorem of calculus. \\[ \\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}=F(b)-F(a) \\] where we assume \\(f(x)\\) is defined for all \\(x\\) in the interval \\([a,b]\\). We call \\(a\\) the lower limit of integration and \\(b\\) the upper limit of integration. The notation \\(\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}\\) means substitute \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\) into \\(F(x)\\) and then subtract the values. This gets rid of the constant of integration \\(c\\). For example, suppose we want to find, \\(\\intop_{1}^{3}xdx.\\) Then 8 First we find an antiderivative or indefinite integral \\(\\int xdx+c\\) and then evaluate this at the limits of integration. \\[\\begin{align*} F(x) &amp; =\\int xdx\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+c\\right]_{x=1}^{x=3},\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\frac{1}{2}3^{2}+c\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}1^{2}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\frac{9}{2}+c\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8}{2}\\\\ &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Note that the indefinite integral has a numerical value, in this case \\(4\\), and there is no constant \\(c\\).   Examples  Find the integral \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{2x}dx\\). 9 In this case the antiderivative is \\(F(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) Also remember the log laws: \\[\\begin{align*} \\log b-\\log a &amp; =\\log\\frac{b}{a}\\\\ \\log b+\\log a &amp; =\\log\\left(ba\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{2x}dx &amp; =\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2x\\right|+c\\right]_{x=1}^{x=2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2(2)\\right|+c-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2\\left(1\\right)\\right|+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|4\\right|-\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|\\frac{4}{2}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}2. \\end{align*}\\] Note that it is not usual to include the constant \\(c\\) as we did in lines 1 and 2 of the solution above. The next example shows this. Find the integral \\(\\int_{2}^{3}\\frac{13}{5x-7}dx\\). 10 In this case the antiderivative is \\(F(x)=\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|5x-7\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{2}^{3}\\frac{13}{5x-7}dx &amp; =\\left[\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|5x-7\\right|\\right]_{2}^{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|15-7\\right|-\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|10-7\\right|\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|8\\right|-\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\left|3\\right|\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{13}{5}\\log_{e}\\frac{8}{3}. \\end{align*}\\]    Exercises:  Find the integral \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{2}{3x}dx\\).

We saw this in the previous section on antidifferentiation. But how do you integrate a linear expression in brackets where the whole bracket is raised to a power? This worksheet will show you how.  This module shows how to integrate functions like : \\[ f\\left(x\\right)=2x^{4}-3x+2 \\] or more generally: \\[ f\\left(x\\right)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}x^{n} \\] where \\(a_{i},\\,i=1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\) are constants. Such functions are called polynomials.  Antidifferentiation Antidifferentiation is the opposite process to differentiation. For example if \\(y=x^{2}\\), then an antiderivative of \\(y\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}\\) because the derivative of \\(\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}\\) is \\(y\\). A mathematical notation for this is \\[ \\int x^{2}dx=\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\textrm{ where $c$ is a constant}. \\] This is read as \u201cthe indefinite integral of \\(x^{2}\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c\\)\u201d. The \\(\\int\\) sign means indefinite integral and \\(dx\\) means with respect to \\(x\\). Here the words \u201cindefinite integral\u201d are the same as \u201cantiderivative\u201d. Integration is more complicated than differentiation. However there are some rules to help us. One of the most important is the power rule which says:1 Note that if \\(n=1\\), \\({\\textstyle 1\/(n-1)}\\) would be \\({\\textstyle 1\/0}\\) which has no meaning. \\(n\\) can be any number (other than 1) - positive, negative or a fraction. Instead of saying c is a constant, we sometimes write \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) which means \\(c\\) is a real number.   Provided \\(n\\neq1\\) then (x{n}dx=x{n+1}+c,)   Examples \\[\\begin{align*} \\int xdx &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\int x^{2}dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\]   Linearity The integral has two properties that let us evaluate more complex functions. They are called the linearity rules:   A constant that multiplies a function may be taken out of the integral. For a constant \\(a\\) and functions \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(g\\left(x\\right)\\) \\[ \\int af\\left(x\\right)dx=a\\int f\\left(x\\right)dx \\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(f\\left(x\\right)+g\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\int f\\left(x\\right)dx+\\int g\\left(x\\right)dx\\\\ \\int\\left(f\\left(x\\right)-g\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\int f\\left(x\\right)dx-\\int g\\left(x\\right)dx. \\end{align*}\\]     Examples  Integrate the constant \\(3\\). Solution:2 Note that \\(3=3x^{0}.\\) In fact, any constant \\(m\\) can be written as \\(mx^{0}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\int3dx &amp; =\\int3x^{0}dx\\\\ &amp; =3\\int x^{0}dx\\quad\\textrm{ by linearity}\\\\ &amp; =3x+c,\\, \\textrm{$c$ a constant, using the power rule.} \\end{align*}\\] Find \\(\\int5xdx\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int5xdx &amp; =5\\int xdx\\quad\\textrm{by linearity}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{2}x^{2}+c,\\, \\textrm{$c$ a constant, using the power rule}. \\end{align*}\\] Find \\(\\int\\left(5x^{2}-3x+4\\right)dx.\\) Solution:3 Note there is a constant for each of the integrals on the right hand side. However, a constant plus a constant still gives you a constant so we just use a single constant \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(5x^{2}-3x+4\\right)dx &amp; =\\int5x^{2}dx+\\int\\left(-3x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; \\quad\\quad+\\int4dx\\ \\textrm{ using linearity}\\\\ &amp; =5\\int x^{2}dx-3\\int\\,xdx+4\\quad\\int dx\\ \\textrm{ using linearity}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{3}x^{3}-\\frac{3}{2}x^{2}+4x+c,\\, \\textrm{$c$ a constant, using the power rule.} \\end{align*}\\]  Note that you can have any number of terms in the integral. For example if \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\ldots a_{n}\\) are constant \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x^{n}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int a_{0}dx+\\int a_{1}xdx+\\int a_{2}x^{2}+\\ldots+\\int a_{n}x^{n}dx\\\\ &amp; =a_{0}x+a_{1}\\int xdx+a_{2}\\int x^{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}\\int x^{n}dx. \\end{align*}\\]   Examples  Integrate \\(f(x)=13x^{2}+x+5\\) with respect to \\(x\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(13x^{2}+x+5\\right)dx &amp; =\\frac{13}{3}x^{3}+\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+5x+c\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrate \\(f\\left(y\\right)=4y^{5}-y^{3}\\) with respect to \\(y\\).

Such integrals are called indefinite integrals or antiderivatives. They do not have a specific value. For a function \\(f(x)\\) suppose we can write an antiderivative \\(F(x)=\\int f(x)dx\\). We then define a definite integral of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) with respect to \\(x\\) using the notation:4 This is known as the first fundamental theorem of calculus. \\[ \\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}=F(b)-F(a) \\] where we assume \\(f(x)\\) is defined for all \\(x\\) in the interval \\([a,b]\\). We call \\(a\\) the lower limit of integration and \\(b\\) the upper limit of integration. The notation \\(\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}\\) means substitute \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\) into \\(F(x)\\) and then subtract the values. This gets rid of the constant of integration \\(c\\).   Examples of Definite Integrals  Suppose we want to find, \\(\\intop_{1}^{3}xdx.\\) Then 5 First we find an antiderivative or indefinite integral \\(\\int xdx+c\\) and then evaluate this at the limits of integration.

The inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is written as \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}.\\) Therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{-1} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}. \\end{align*}\\] Not every square matrix has an inverse. If a matrix does not have an inverse, it is called singular. This module describes how to find the inverse of a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix using elementary row operations.  Finding the Inverse In theory, we use the matrix equation \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf AB} &amp; ={\\bf I} \\end{align*}\\] and pre-multiply both sides by \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) (assuming it exists) to get \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf AB} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf {\\bf I}}\\\\ {\\bf I}{\\bf B} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}\\\\ {\\bf B} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}. \\end{align*}\\] In practice, we form the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf A}|{\\bf I}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and use elementary row operations to convert this to \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf I}|{\\bf B}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] That is, for a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix we use elementary row operations to change \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] to \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{ccc} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}\\\\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} &amp; b_{23}\\\\ b_{31} &amp; b_{32} &amp; b_{33} \\end{array}\\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf B} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{ccc} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}\\\\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} &amp; b_{23}\\\\ b_{31} &amp; b_{32} &amp; b_{33} \\end{array}\\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is then the inverse \\({\\bf A}^{-1}.\\) Note that there are other methods to determine the inverse but they are not considered here.  Elementary Row Operations Elementary row operations are:  Multiplication of a row by a constant; Addition and subtraction of a multiple of a row to another row; Interchanging two rows.  When using elementary row operations to find the inverse, there is a preferred order as shown in Figure 1 below. \\[\\begin{align*} \\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\right]}_{\\text{1. Original matrix.}} &amp; \\rightarrow\\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ 0 &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\\\ 0 &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\right]}_{2.a_{11}=1,\\,a_{21}=a_{23}=0}\\rightarrow\\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_{23}\\\\ 0 &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\right]}_{3.a_{22}=1}\\rightarrow\\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; a_{13}\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_{23}\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\right]}_{4.a_{12}=a_{32}=0}\\rightarrow\\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; a_{13}\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_{23}\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]}_{5.a_{31}=1}\\rightarrow\\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]}_{6.a_{13}=a_{23}=0}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that the \\(a_{ij}\\) may take new values at each step of the process. If this looks confusing, don\u2019t worry. It is easier to see with specific numbers as in the following examples.   Example \\(1\\) Find the inverse of the matrix \\({\\bf A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Solution Set up the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf A}|{\\bf I}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We now use row operations to reduce the matrix on the left hand side (LHS) to the identity matrix . Returning to our problem, we already have a \\(1\\) in the \\(a_{11}\\) position of the LHS matrix so we first make \\(a_{21}=a_{31}=0\\) as follows \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}+R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ R_{3}-R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(2\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. Now we want \\(a_{22}=1\\) in the LHS matrix. There are two ways to do this. We could divide \\(R_{2}\\) by \\(2\\) however this introduces a fraction that may be awkward (fractions are commonly required but we delay their use until necessary). The other way, which we will use, is to interchange \\(R_{2}\\) and \\(R_{3}\\) as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3}\\\\ R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(3\\) figure \\(1\\) above and partially completes Step 4. Next we make \\(a_{32}=0\\) in the LHS matrix by subtracting \\(2R_{2}\\) from \\(R_{3}.\\) As a bonus this gives \\(a_{33}=1\\) in the LHS matrix: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}-2R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Steps \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. Finally we make \\(a_{13}=a_{23}=0\\) using \\(R_{3}\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{1}\\\\ R_{2}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(6\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. The LHS matrix is the identity matrix and so the RHS is the inverse. That is \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] You should always check that \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)1 Since in general, for matrices \\({\\bf A}\\)and \\({\\bf B},\\) \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf B} &amp; \\neq{\\bf B}{\\bf A} \\end{align*}\\] it is important to check both \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf I}\\) and \\({\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)  We have \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp;

Transpose of a matrix The transpose of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is denoted \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\)and is found by interchanging the rows and the columns. The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column etc. If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\) is an \\(n\\times m\\) matrix.  Examples  If \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4\\\\ 5 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] then by interchanging the rows and columns we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]  In this case \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a \\(3\\times2\\) matrix and its transpose \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\) is a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix.  If \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{B} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 7 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{B}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 2 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\[\\begin{align*} \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{C}} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{C}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]  Note that in this case \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}^{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is called a symmetric matrix.    Symmetric Matrix A symmetric matrix is a square matrix which is equal to its transpose. It is also symmetric about its leading diagonal (top left to bottom right).  Examples  The matrix  \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{D} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is symmetric because \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{D}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\mathbf{D}. \\end{align*}\\] 2. The matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{E} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 4 &amp; -2 &amp; -3\\\\ 5 &amp; -3 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is symmetric because \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{E}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 4 &amp; -2 &amp; -3\\\\ 5 &amp; -3 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\mathbf{E}. \\end{align*}\\] 3. The matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{F} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 4\\\\ -2 &amp; 3 &amp; -4\\\\ 4 &amp; -4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is symmetric because \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{F}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 4\\\\ -2 &amp; 3 &amp; -4\\\\ 4 &amp; -4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\mathbf{F}. \\end{align*}\\]    Orthogonal Matrix A square matrix is orthogonal if \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{T}=\\mathbf{I}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the unit matrix (also called the identity matrix). Because \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}=\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\\mathbf{I}\\) it follows that for an orthogonal matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}=\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) . This can be useful for finding the inverse of an orthogonal matrix as it is usually easier to find the transpose than the inverse of a matrix. Note that the determinant of an orthhogonal matrix is either equal to \\(+1\\) (a rotation matrix) or \\(-1\\) (a reflection matrix). The rows of an orthogonal matrix are mutually orthogonal (perpendicular) unit vectors. The columns of an orthogonal matrix are also mutually orthogonal unit vectors.  Examples The rotation matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\) is an orthogonal matrix that rotates points, lines and regions through an angle of \\(\\theta^{\\circ}\\) anticlockwise. 1 Note that in the following sections, we use the trigonometric identity \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos^{2}\\theta+\\sin^{2}\\theta &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] The determinant, \\(\\det\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|=\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right|=\\cos^{2}\\theta+\\sin^{2}\\theta=1.\\) \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{A} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos^{2}\\theta+\\sin^{2}\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta-\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta &amp; \\sin^{2}\\theta+\\cos^{2}\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{T} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos^{2}\\theta+\\sin^{2}\\theta &amp; -\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta &amp; \\sin^{2}\\theta+\\cos^{2}\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] That is to say \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{T}=\\mathbf{I}\\). Hence \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{A}^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\det\\mathbf{A}}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{1}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\mathbf{A}^{T}. \\end{align*}\\] The reflection matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) is an orthogonal matrix that reflects points, lines and regions in the \\(x\\)-axis. \\(\\left|\\mathbf{B}\\right|=-1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{T}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) \\(\\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}^{T}=\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{T}=\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\) Note that in this case \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is both orthogonal and symmetric.

You will need to resort to other numerical or analytical methods to solve these differential equations. Keywords(tags): What is a first order linear unseparable differential equation?

If two equal numbers are written to the same base then the indices must be equal. Exponential equations have a term in which the variable appears as a power (index or exponent).

On the calculator the LOG button will calculate \\(\\log_{10}x\\) and the LN button will calculate \\(\\log_{e}x\\). Logarithms with base e are known as natural logarithms and sometimes the abbreviation \\(\\ln x\\) is used for \\(\\log_{e}x.\\)  Examples  Solve \\(3^{x}=10\\) to 3 decimal places.

At primary school you were probably exposed to long division, whereby a big number was divided by another big number. Sometimes this gave an integer1 An integer is a positive or negative whole number and may include \\(0.\\) result or sometimes a number plus a fraction. For example in the case that the result was an integer we could have  This means that \\(6750\\div15=450\\) or \\(6750=15\\times450.\\) In case the numbers do not exactly divide we could have  This means that \\[\\begin{align*} 6751\\div15 &amp; =450+\\frac{1}{15} \\end{align*}\\] or, in decimal form, \\[\\begin{align*} 6751\\div15 &amp; =450.0\\overline{6} \\end{align*}\\] where the over-bar on the \\(6\\) indicates it repeats. In the age of calculators, long division of numbers is not so important. However it is still useful in solving cubic (and higher degree) polynomials.2 The degree of a polynomial is the highest power to which the variable is raised. For example, \\[\\begin{align*} 5x^{4}+2x^{2}-3 \\end{align*}\\] is a polynomial of degree \\(4.\\) Polynomials of degree \\(1,2\\), \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) are called linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic respectively.  This module describes how to divide a polynomial by a polynomial of lower degree using long division and how to solve cubic equations.  The Basic Approach For long division, a useful algorithm, whether for numbers or polynomials is Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring Down.3 An algorithm is a series of instructions. If you look at long division on the web, you may find some differences. This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:   Example 1 Divide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\) First we set up the long division by writing \\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\] Now we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down. Divide Divide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\] Multiply Multiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\] Subtract Subtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\] Bring Down Bring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] We now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero. Divide Divide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below. \\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] Multiply Multiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below. \\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\] Subtract Subtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder. \\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] This is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) In other words4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]    Dividing a Higher Order Polynomial The basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.  Example 2 Divide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\). First we write the long division as shown below: \\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\] We then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down. Divide Divide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\). That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(x^{3}\\) to get \\(x^{2}\\) and write \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\] Multiply Multiply \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) and write as below: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\end{array}\\] Subtract Subtract \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}\\)and write as: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2\\phantom{bbbi+11x)} \\end{array}\\] Bring Down Bring down the \\(11x\\) term and write as: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\] Divide We now repeat the algorithm. We divide the highest power of \\(x-1\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\). That is, we divide \\(x\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x\\) and write as follows. \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,\\,-5x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\] Multiply Multiply \\(-5x\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) and write: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\end{array}\\] Subtract Subtract \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) from \\(-5x^{2}+11x\\) to get \\(6x\\) and write: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ - \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x \\phantom{)-6} \\end{array}\\] Bring Down Bring down the \\(-6\\) and write as \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] Divide Divide the leading term of \\(x-1\\) into the leading term of \\(6x-6.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(6x\\) to get \\(6\\) and write as follows: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] Multiply Multiply \\(x-1\\) by \\(6\\) and write as follows: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\end{array}\\] Subtract Subtract \\(6x-6-\\left(6x-6\\right)\\) to get \\(0\\) and write as follows: \\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] As there are no more terms to bring down, we stop the algorithm. Our result is that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\] This is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6=\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] This is probably the best interpretation as we can then factorise the quadratic term on the RHS to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Which is of value when we are trying to graph \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\) as it gives us the \\(x-\\)intercepts of the function.   Example 3 Divide \\(\\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\). The major difference from example 2 above is that there is no \\(x^{2}\\) term in \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1. \\end{align*}\\] We get around this by writing \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =2x^{3}+0x^{2}-3x+1 \\end{align*}\\] That is, we set up the long division as \\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\] and apply the algorithm used in Example 1 and 2 above. Applying the algorithm we obtain: \\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] Hence we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =2x^{2}+2x-1 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\times\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] In your work, the final result as shown above is all that is required. That is you would write: \\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\] The steps (divide, multiply, subtract, bring down) identified in Examples \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are for explanation only. You do not have to make reference to them. Please try Exercise 1.    The Factor Theorem Solution of a cubic equation is frequently required in maths, science and engineering. The long division of polynomials described above is an important tool in this. However the Factor Theorem is equally important. The Factor Theorem states:   If \\(P(x)\\) is a polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(P(a)=0\\) then \\((x-a)\\) is a factor of \\(P(x)\\). We can use the factor theorem to find one factor of a polynomial, and then use polynomial long division to find the remaining factor(s).    Example 4 Solve the equation \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0.\\) We first use the Factor Theorem to try and get a linear factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24.\\) Let \\[ P\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 \\] then letting \\(x=1,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(1\\right) &amp; =1-5-2+24\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\). Now try \\(x=-1\\) to get, \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1-5+2+24\\\\ &amp; =20\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)=\\left(x+1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\). Now try \\(x=2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(2\\right) &amp; =8-20-4+24\\\\ &amp; =8\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-2\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).

Two equations in two variables are said to be simultaneous if both must be considered at the same time. An ordered pair \\(\\left(x,y\\right)\\) which satisfies both equations is said to be a solution for the simultaneous equations. Three methods for solving a pair of simultaneous equations using algebra are: \\(\\text{1. elimination}\\) \\(\\text{2. substitution}\\) \\(\\text{3. graphical.}\\) Each method is discussed in this module.  Elimination Method In the elimination method we manipulate the equations so that one of the variables has coefficients that are equal or opposite in sign. The manipulation is multiplication of one or both equations by a constant. Then we add or subtract the equations to eliminate a variable.  Example 1 (Elimination) Solve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\). Solution \\[\\begin{align*} x+y &amp; =6\\quad\\left(1\\right)\\quad\\text{(number the equations)}\\\\ x-y &amp; =2\\quad\\left(2\\right)\\quad\\text{(note the $y$ coefficients are equal and opposite)}\\\\ 2x &amp; =8\\quad\\left(1\\right)+\\left(2\\right)\\quad\\text{(add equations to eliminate $y$ )}\\\\ x &amp; =4.\\\\ \\textrm{Substitute $x=4$ } &amp; \\textrm{back into equation $\\left(1\\right)$ or $\\left(2\\right)$ to solve for }y\\\\ 4+y &amp; =6\\quad\\text{(using $\\left(1\\right))$ }\\\\ y &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is (\\(4,2\\)). We can check the solution by substituting in the original equations. Substituting \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=2\\) in \\((1)\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =x+y\\\\ &amp; =4+2\\\\ &amp; =6\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS.} \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=2\\) in \\((2)\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =x-y\\\\ &amp; =4-2\\\\ &amp; =2\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS.} \\end{align*}\\] Hence our solution is correct.   Example 2 (Elimination) Solve simultaneously \\(3x+2y=10\\) and \\(4x+3y=13.\\) Solution \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2y &amp; =10\\quad\\left(1\\right)\\quad\\text{(number the equations)}\\\\ 4x+3y &amp; =13\\quad\\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] In this case we need to manipulate the equations to make the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) coefficients the same or opposite in sign. We will eliminate \\(x\\) and so multiply equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(4\\) (coefficient of \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\)) and multiply equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) by \\(3\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right))\\) to get:1 To eliminate \\(y\\) we would multiply equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(3\\) (coefficient of \\(y\\) in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\)) and multiply equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) by \\(2\\) (the coefficient of \\(y\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right))\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} 9x+6y &amp; =30\\quad\\left(3\\right)\\\\ 8x+6y &amp; =26\\quad\\left(4\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then subtracting \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(x=4\\) into either equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\(y\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 12x+8y &amp; =40\\quad\\left(3\\right)\\\\ 12x+9y &amp; =39\\quad\\left(4\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now \\(x\\) may be eliminated by subtracting equation \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(4\\right)\\):2 We could also subtract equation \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} -y &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The answer is the same and the order of subtraction doesn\u2019t matter. \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute this into either equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right)\\). It doesn\u2019t matter which one you use though sometimes one choice is a little easier. In this case we use equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =10\\\\ 3x &amp; =10+2\\\\ x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is (\\(4,-1\\)) and this may be checked by substitution of \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=-1\\) into equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\) For equation \\(\\left(1\\right):\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3\\left(4\\right)+2\\left(-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =12-2\\\\ &amp; =10\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] and for equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =4\\left(4\\right)+3\\left(-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =16-3\\\\ &amp; =13\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.    Substitution Method In the substitution method, the simpler equation is transposed to make one of the variables the subject. This variable is then substituted into the second equation to get an equation in one variable which may be solved. Once one variable is known, we can solve for the other variable.  Example 3 (Substitution) Solve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\). Solution First number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} x+y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ x-y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Rearrange \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to make \\(x\\) the subject:3 Note that you can also make \\(y\\) the subject and proceed in the same way. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\(y=6-x.\\) Substituting in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x-\\left(6-x\\right) &amp; =2\\\\ -2x &amp; =2+6\\\\ x &amp; =4 \\end{align*}\\] and so on. \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6-y. \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) and solve for \\(y:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 6-y-y &amp; =2\\\\ -2y &amp; =-4\\\\ y &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] To find \\(x\\), substitute \\(y=2\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right)\\). We use equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} x+2 &amp; =6\\\\ x &amp; =4 \\end{align*}\\] and the solution is \\(x=4\\text{ and }y=2\\) or \\(\\left(4,2\\right).\\) This may be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)   Example 4 (Substitution) Solve the simultaneous equations \\(3x+2y=10\\) and \\(4x+3y=13\\). Solution First number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2y &amp; =10 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 4x+3y &amp; =13. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] We can make either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) the subject using equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right).\\) We will make \\(y\\) the subject. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =10-3x\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{10-3x}{2} \\end{align*}\\] Substitute in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 4x+3\\left(\\frac{10-3x}{2}\\right) &amp; =13\\\\ 8x+3\\left(10-3x\\right) &amp; =26\\\\ 8x-9x &amp; =26-30\\\\ -x &amp; =-4\\\\ x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute for \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\times4+2y &amp; =10\\\\ 2y &amp; =-2\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=4,\\ y=-1\\) or \\(\\left(4,-1\\right).\\) This can be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)    Graphical Method In the graphical method the straight line graph representing each equation is plotted on the same set of axes. The solution is the point of intersection of the two lines. The graphs must be plotted accurately for this method to give an accurate answer. For this reason it is not usually used unless specifically asked for.  Example 5 (Graphical Method) Solve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\) graphically. Solution Graphs representing each linear equation are drawn and the point of intersection is read from the graph.  The solution is (\\(4,2\\)). Check by substituting in each equation: \\(4+2=6\\) and \\(4-2=2\\).    Equations Without Solutions Some pairs of equations do not have a solution. Graphically this means that the two lines do not intersect.  Example 6 (No Solution) Solve the simultaneous equations \\(2x-y=6\\) and \\(-4x+2y=-7\\). Solution Number the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x-y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -4x+2y &amp; =-7. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] You can use any of the three methods above to try and solve the equations. We will use substitution. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x-6. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting into equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -4x+2\\left(2x-6\\right) &amp; =-7\\\\ -4x+4x-12 &amp; =-7\\\\ -12 &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The last line is impossible and so we conclude no solution exists. We show the graphs of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) below. The two lines are parallel and never intersect, so no solution exists.     Multiple Solutions Some pairs of simultaneous equations have multiple solutions. In this case, the equations have the same graph. That is one line lies on the other line.  Example 7 (Multiple Solutions) Solve \\(y=1-3x\\) and \\(6x=2(1-y)\\). Solution Rearrange the equations so that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are on the same sides and number the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+y &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 6x+2y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that these two lines are the same because \\(\\left(2\\right)=2\\times\\left(1\\right).\\) Consequently they have the same graph and there are multiple values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy them. For example, setting \\(x=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(y=1\\) so \\(\\left(0,1\\right)\\) is a solution. Setting \\(y=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(x=1\/3\\) and so \\(\\left(1\/3,0\\right)\\) is also a solution. In fact there are an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line \\(3x+y=1.\\)    Exercise 1 Solve simultaneously using either the elimination or substitution method: \\(1.\\ y=x-3\\text{ and $5x-2y=18.$ }\\) \\(2.\\ y=3x+4\\text{ and $2x+3y=23.$ }\\) \\(3.\\ 4x+y=23\\ \\text{and $x-y=2.$ }\\) \\(4.\\ -3x+2y=-4\\ \\text{and $5x-2y=8$ .}\\) \\(5.\\ 3x-5y=14\\ \\text{and $2x+y=5.$ }\\) \\(6.\\ 3x+2y=18\\ \\text{and $2x-5y=-7$ .}\\)      Exercise 2 Solve the following simultaneous equations graphically. \\(1.\\ y=x-3\\ \\text{and $x+y=5.$ }\\) \\(2.\\ 5x-y=8\\ \\text{and $2y-3x=-2.$ }\\) \\(3.\\ x+y=1\\ \\text{and $y-2x=7.$ }\\)       Download this pdf document: ES2 Simultaneous Equations (PDF 247 KB)   What's next...

The graphs of both functions have an amplitude of 1 and a period of 2&pi; radians. The functions \\(y=\\sin x\\) and \\(y=\\cos x\\) have a domain of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and a range of \\([-1,1]\\). The graphs of these functions are periodic graphs, that is, the shape of the graph repeats every set period. The graphs of both functions have an amplitude of \\(1\\) and a period of \\(2\\pi\\) radians (that is the graph repeats every \\(2\\pi\\) units). They are shown below.   When looking at the graphs remember \\(\\pi\\approx3.142,\\) so \\(2\\pi\\approx6.284\\). In this module we look at how the basic graphs may be transformed into graphs of more complex trigonometric functions.  Change of Amplitude and Period The graphs of both \\(y=a\\sin nx\\) and \\(y=a\\cos nx\\) have an amplitude \\(\\left|a\\right|\\) and a period of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\).  Examples  Graph \\(y=3\\sin x\\).   In this case, \\(a=3\\) and \\(n=1\\), therefore the graph has an amplitude of \\(3\\) and period of \\(2\\pi\\).  Graph \\(y=3\\cos2x\\).   In this case, \\(a=3\\) and \\(n=2\\), therefore the graph has an amplitude of \\(3\\) and period of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{2}=\\pi\\).    Vertical translation The graph of \\(y=a\\sin nx+k\\) is the graph of \\(y=a\\sin nx\\) translated up \\(k\\) units (or down \\(k\\) units if \\(k\\) is negative). The graphs of \\({\\color{blue}y=\\sin x+2}\\) and \\({\\color{red}y=\\sin x}\\) are shown below.  Similarly, the graph of \\(y=a\\cos nx+k\\) is the graph of \\(y=a\\cos nx\\) translated up \\(k\\) units (or down \\(k\\) units if \\(k\\) is negative).   Horizontal Translation Replacing the \\(x\\) with \\(\\left(x-\\phi\\right)\\) shifts the graphs of \\(y=\\sin x\\) and \\(y=\\cos x\\) horizontally \\(\\phi\\) units to the right. Replacing the \\(x\\) with \\(\\left(x+\\phi\\right)\\) shifts the graphs of \\(y=\\sin x\\) and \\(y=\\cos x\\) horizontally \\(\\phi\\) units to the left.

If you know the graph of a function, you can often transform it to a graph of a more complex but related function. A simple example is the graph of the line \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =x. \\end{align*}\\] It has the graph:  The graph of \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =x+2 \\end{align*}\\] is shown in red below  This is just the graph of \\(y=x\\) shifted \\(2\\) units upward and is an example of a transformation involving vertical translation. This module discusses how to transform the graphs of known functions to more complex functions using simple rules that are called transformations. In particular, we will consider the following transformations:  Reflection Translation Dilation Combinations of the above.   Basic Graphs When attempting to graph a function, the following items need to be considered:  \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts turning points behavior as \\(x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\) asymptotes. It is very useful to know the graphs of some simple functions. You can then transform them to more complex functions using the contents of this module. Below are some basic graphs that you should know.1 While it is best that you know these graphs, if you cannot recall them, you can still determine their graphs by plotting some points.   Graph of \\(y=x\\) This is a straight line with slope or gradient of \\(1.\\) It passes through the origin and is shown below.    Graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) This is a parabola with vertex at the origin as shown below.    Graph of \\(y=x^{3}\\) The essential feature is that the graph goes through the origin increases for positive \\(x\\) and decreases for negative \\(x.\\)    Graph of \\(y=1\/x\\) This is a graph with asymptotes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x-\\) axis) as shown below.    Graph of \\(y=a^{x}\\) The basic graph is as shown below for \\(a=1.6\\).  The important thing to note is that the \\(y-\\) intercept is at \\(1\\) and doesn\u2019t depend on the value of \\(a\\) because \\(a^{0}=1.\\) Also the function cannot be less than zero so the negative \\(x-\\)axis is an asymptote. Changing the value of \\(a\\) will change the values on the \\(y-\\)axis but the basic shape of the graph is the same. In practice, the most common value of \\(a\\) is \\(e\\) and is most likely to come up in your course. So the graph above gives the basic shape of \\(y=e^{x}\\) but the \\(y-\\) axis values are incorrect.   Graph of \\(y=\\log x\\) The graph is shown below.  The important characteristic is that the graph cuts the \\(x-\\) axis at \\(1\\) because \\(\\log\\left(1\\right)=0.\\) Note that this graph is similar for \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\log_{e}\\left(x\\right)\\) or any other log base .   Graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\)     Transformations As mentioned above, transformations may be used to modify basic graphs. The transformations are  Reflection Translation Dilation Combinations of the above.    Reflection As the name suggests, a reflection is a mirror image of a graph. Reflection may be about any line but generally involves the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axes. For a graph \\(y=f\\left(x\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =f\\left(-x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] reflects the graph about the \\(y-\\)axis while \\[\\begin{align*} y= &amp; -f\\left(x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] reflects the graph about the \\(x-\\)axis.  Example \\(1\\): Reflection of \\(y=a^{x}\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes Referring to the graphs shown below. The original graph is \\(y=a^{x}\\) and is shown in blue. Reflection about the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=a^{-x}\\) and is shown in red. Reflection about the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-a^{x}\\) and is shown in green.    Example \\(2\\): Reflection of \\(y=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes Original graph is \\(y=x^{2}\\) and is shown in blue below Reflection about the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=\\left(-x\\right)^{2}=x^{2}.\\) This means the reflection in the \\(y-\\)axis of the original graph doesn\u2019t change anything. This is due to symmetry of the original graph about the \\(y-\\)axis. Reflection about the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-x^{2}\\) and is shown below in red.    Example \\(3\\): Reflection of \\(y=2x+1\\) in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes Original graph is \\(y=2x+1\\) and is shown in blue below. Reflection in the \\(y-\\)axis is given by \\(y=2\\left(-x\\right)+1=-2x+1\\) and is shown in green. Reflection in the \\(x-\\)axis is given by \\(y=-\\left(2x+1\\right)=-2x-1\\) and is shown in red.     Translation Translation involves moving a graph, in the \\(x-y\\) plane, horizontally or vertically.  Horizontal The graph of \\(y=f\\left(x-a\\right)\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units to the right. The graph of \\(y=f\\left(x+a\\right)\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units to the left.   Vertical The graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)+b\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d units up. The graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)-b\\) is a shift of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d units down.   Example \\(4\\): Translation of \\(y=\\log\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(1\\) unit to the right. Original graph is \\(y=\\log\\left(x\\right)\\) and is shown in blue below. The translated graph is \\(y=\\log\\left(x-1\\right)\\) and is shown in red below. It is the graph of the original function shifted \\(1\\) unit to the right.  Note that the negative \\(y-\\)axis forms an asymptote for the original graph. The translated graph has an asymptote of \\(x=1\\) and is shown as a dotted line. The new asymptote should be shown on the graph of the transformed function.   Example \\(5\\): Translation of \\(y=1\/x\\) three units to the left The original graph is of \\(y=1\/x\\) and is shown in blue below. The translated graph is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\frac{1}{x+3} \\end{align*}\\] and is the graph of the original function shifted \\(3\\) units to the left. It is shown in red below.  The original graph had the \\(y-\\)axis as its asymptote. The transformed graph has an asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) which is shown as a dotted line.   Example \\(6\\): Translation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right),\\) \\(\\pi\/2\\) units to the left The original graph is of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=\\sin\\left(x+\\pi\/2\\right)\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively below.  This is an interesting example as the translation converts the sine function to the cosine function.2 To see this, recall the trigonometry identity \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\left(a+b\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(a\\right)\\cos\\left(b\\right)+\\cos\\left(a\\right)\\sin\\left(b\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now let \\(a=x\\) and \\(b=\\pi\/2.\\) Substituting in the above identity we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\left(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\cdot0+\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\cdot1\\\\ &amp; =\\cos\\left(x\\right). \\end{align*}\\]   Example \\(7\\): Translation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) two units vertically up The original graph is of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)+2\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively below.  It is clear that the translation simply moves the graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) up \\(2\\) units. Nothing else changes.   Example \\(8\\): Translation of \\(y=x^{2}\\) two units vertically down The original graph is of \\(y=x^{2}\\). The transformed graph is \\(y=x^{2}-2\\) . Both graphs are shown below in blue and red respectively.  It is clear that the translation simply moves the graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) down \\(2\\) units. Nothing else changes.    Dilations Dilations stretch or compress a graph of a function. The stretching or compression can occur in the directions of either the \\(x\\) or the \\(y\\) axes, or both. The graph of \\(y=af\\left(x\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. If \\(a&gt;1\\) the graph is stretched or elongated. If \\(a&lt;1,\\)the graph is compressed or squashed. The graph of \\(y=f\\left(bx\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(1\/b\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis. If \\(b&gt;1\\) the graph is compressed or squashed. If \\(b&lt;1,\\)the graph is stretched or elongated.  Example \\(9\\): Dilation of \\(y=x^{2}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis by a factor of \\(4\\) and 1\/3 The graphs are shown below. The original graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) is shown in blue. The dilation \\(y=4x^{2}\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis. The dilation \\(y=\\frac{1}{3}x^{2}\\)is shown in green and shows that the original graph is squashed parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis.    Example \\(10\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(2\\) The graphs are shown below. The original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\) The dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(2x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is squashed by a factor of \\(2\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(\\pi\\) which is half that of the original graph.    Example \\(11\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(1\/2\\) The graphs are shown below. The original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\) The dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(0.5x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(4\\pi\\) which is twice that of the original graph.     Combinations of Transformations More complicated graphs may be obtained from a basic graph by combining reflection, translation and dilation. In such cases you start with the basic graph and do the dilation first (if there is one). After this step, do translations and reflections in any order.  Example \\(12\\): Graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\) The basic graph is \\(y=x^{3}.\\) We want to transform this to \\(y=2x^{3}+4.\\) This involves two transformations \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{\\ 2\\ }_{\\text{Transformation1 }}x^{3}+\\underbrace{\\ 4\\ }_{\\text{Transformation 2}} \\end{align*}\\] Transformation \\(1\\) is a dilation of 2 parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. It is a stretching of the original graph parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. Transformation \\(2\\) is a translation of \\(4\\) units upward. The basic graph to be transformed is \\(y=x^{3}\\) and is shown in blue below.  We first do the dilation on this basic graph. That is we graph \\(y=2x^{3}\\). This is shown as the dashed blue graph below.  Finally we do the translation of \\(4\\) units upwards to get the desired graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\). This is shown in red below.  The only thing left to do is identify where the graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\) intersects the \\(x-\\)axis. To do this we set \\(y=0\\) and solve for \\(x.\\) That is \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}+4 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x^{3} &amp; =-4\\\\ x^{3} &amp; =-2\\\\ x &amp; =-1.26. \\end{align*}\\] This information can be added to get the following figure:  Our final answer is the red graph shown below:    Example \\(13\\): Graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) The basic graph in this case is \\(y=x^{2}.\\) There are three transformations involved: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{-}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}\\underbrace{\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}}_{\\text{Tranformation 2 }}\\underbrace{-1}_{\\text{Transformation 3}} \\end{align*}\\] Transformation \\(1\\) is a reflection about the \\(x-\\)axis. Transformation \\(2\\) is shift of \\(y=x^{2}\\) to the left by \\(2\\)units. Transformation \\(3\\) is a shift of \\(1\\) unit downwards. As there is no dilation, we are free to make the transforms on the basic graph in any order. In this example we will go from transformation \\(1\\) to \\(3\\) but the order does not matter. The figure below shows the basic graph \\(y=x^{2}\\) in blue.  Transformation \\(1\\) reflects this in the \\(x-\\)axis. This is the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\) and is shown in dashed blue below.  Transformation 2 shifts the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\), \\(2\\) units to the left. This is the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x-2\\right)^{2}\\) and is shown in orange.  Transformation \\(3\\) shifts the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}\\) down one unit. This is the desired graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) and is shown below in red.  The intercept of the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) appears to at \\(\\left(0,-5)\\right)\\). This can be checked by setting \\(x=0:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(0+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-5. \\end{align*}\\] The final graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) is shown below in red. We have marked the \\(y-\\)intercept at \\(\\left(0,-5\\right)\\) and the vertex at \\(\\left(-2,1\\right).\\)    Example \\(14\\): Graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) The basic graph is of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) . The graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) involves two transformations: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\sqrt{\\underbrace{\\,-x}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}}+\\underbrace{\\,2}_{\\text{Transformation 2}}. \\end{align*}\\] Transformation 1 is a reflection of the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) in the \\(y-\\)axis and is the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\). Transformation 2 is a translation of \\(2\\)units vertically up and gives the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}+2\\). The graphs of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\), and \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) are shown below in blue, dashed blue and red, respectively.

A quadratic graph is the graph of a quadratic function. This module describes the graphing of quadratic functions. A quadratic function has the form \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) where \\(a\\neq0\\) . The graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola.

A parabola is symmetrical about a vertical line through the vertex. If \\(a&gt;0\\), then the parabola opens upwards (and has a minimum turning point).  If \\(a&lt;0\\), then the parabola opens downwards (and has a maximum turning point).

This module defines the trigonometric functions using angles in a unit circle.  The Unit Circle A unit circle is a circle that is centered at the origin and has a radius of one as shown below. 1 The origin is the point with co-ordinates \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\)  An angle measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis maybe used to define any point on the unit circle. Angles may be positive or negative. Positive angles are in an anti-clockwise direction. and negative angles are in a clockwise direction as shown below.  Although there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle, it is possible to to rotate through more than \\(360^{\\circ}\\). For example a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}\\) identifies the same point as a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}=405^{\\circ}\\).   Angular Measurement and the Unit Circle Though angles are often measured in degrees, they may also be measured in radians. One radian is the angle subtended from the \\(x-\\) axis by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. In a unit circle , the radius is \\(1\\). This is illustrated below:  In the figure, the red arc is of length \\(1\\) and is the same length as the radius. The angle formed is one radian. Radians are abbreviated as rad or a superscript \\(c\\) like \\(^{c}\\). Since the circumference of the unit circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians 2 The circumference formula is \\(C=2\\pi r\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius. Since \\(r=1\\) in a unit circle, we see the circumference is \\(2\\pi\\). and there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle we have \\[ 360^{\\circ}=2\\pi\\textrm{ rad.} \\] By dividing the above equation by a number it is possible to derive the following angles in degrees in terms of radians as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} 30^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ 45^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\ 60^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ 90^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ 180^{\\circ} &amp; =\\pi\\\\ 150^{\\circ} &amp; =5\\times30^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =5\\times\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\\\ 270^{\\circ} &amp; =3\\times90^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =3\\times\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\pi}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Angles in radians may also be positive and negative. The same convention is used as for degrees, a positive rotation is anti-clockwise and a negative rotation is clockwise.   Sine and Cosine on the Unit Circle Imagine a point \\(P\\left(x,y\\right)\\) on the unit circle as shown below.  In the triangle \\(POQ\\), the hypotenuse \\(OP\\) is \\(1\\), the adjacent side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(OQ\\) and the opposite side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(QP\\). Using the definitions of sine and cosine in a right angled triangle we get 3 Remember that \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{OQ}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{1}\\\\ &amp; =x \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{QP}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{y}{1}\\\\ &amp; =y \\end{align*}\\] That is, any point on the unit circle has coordinates \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\cos\\theta\\\\ y &amp; =\\sin\\theta \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle (positive or negative) measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis to the point. Examples: \\(\\sin\\left(0\\right)=0\\), \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\sin\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\), \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(0\\right)=1,\\) \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\) cos\\(\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=0\\).   The Tangent Function Consider the figure below.  The triangles \\(OMN\\) and \\(OQP\\) are similar therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{MN}{OM} &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ}\\\\ MN &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ} &amp; since\\ OM=1 \\end{align*}\\] \\(OM=1\\) (it is a unit circle). We define the length \\(MN\\) to be the tangent of the angle \\(\\theta\\) 4 We call this the tangent as it is the distance measured on the vertical tangent to the circle that passes through the point \\(\\left(1,0\\right)\\). and abbreviate this to \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\). Also \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)=PQ\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)=OQ.\\) Substituting these relationships into equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(\\theta\\right) &amp; =\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] This agrees with the usual definition of tan from right angled trigonometry.   Exact Values of Sine, Cosine and Tangent Functions To find the value of \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right),\\,\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) and \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) we usually use a scientific calculator. 5 When using the calculator it is essential that it be in degrees or radians mode. However, there are some special angles that are worth remembering. These are shown in the following table.              Angle \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) \\(0^{\\circ}\\) \\(30^{\\circ}=\\pi\/6\\) \\(45^{\\circ}=\\pi\/4\\) \\(60^{\\circ}=\\pi\/3\\) \\(90^{\\circ}=\\pi\/2\\) \\(180^{\\circ}=\\pi\\) \\(270^{\\circ}=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\)     \\(\\sin\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) 1 0 -1   \\(\\cos\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) \\(1\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) 0 -1 0   \\(\\tan\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) 1 \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) undefined 0 undefined    If you know the exact values above, you can work out the exact values for other angles using the symmetry of the unit circle.   Quadrants The coordinate plane is divided into an upper and lower section by the \\(x\\)-axis. It is further divided into quadrants by the \\(y\\)-axis. These four quadrants are numbered from one to four in an anti-clockwise direction as shown below:  Knowing exact values for some angles in quadrant 1, allows you to find exact values in other quadrants.  Example 1: Find the exact value of \\(\\sin\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\). Solution: It is important to make a sketch as shown below. Remember \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}=120^{\\circ}\\).  First draw in the angle you are interested in. In this case it is \\(2\\pi\/3\\) and is shown in blue as are the required values for the circular functions sin and cos. Now use symmetry of the unit circle about the \\(y-\\) axis to draw in an angle that is related to \\(2\\pi\/3\\) but for which you know the exact value. In this case it is \\(\\pi\/3\\) and is shown in red. You can see that the length of \\(NQ\\) is the same as \\(MP\\) which means \\[\\begin{align*} NQ &amp; =MP\\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\] Now note that the the lengths of \\(ON\\) and \\(MO\\) are the same but \\(MO=-ON=-\\cos\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =-ON\\\\ &amp; =-\\cos\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]   Example 2: Find the exact value of \\(\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right)\\). Plotting \\(330^{\\circ}\\) on a unit circle shows that \\(\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right)\\) is closely related to \\(\\sin\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right).\\) The \\(y-\\)coordinates differ only by sign because the distances from the \\(x-\\)axis are the same.  We have \\[\\begin{align*} MP &amp; =-MQ\\\\ \\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; =-\\sin\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\] Note: \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; =\\cos\\left(360^{\\circ}-30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]   Example 3: Find the exact value of \\(\\tan\\left(4\\pi\/3\\right)\\). Plotting \\(4\\pi\/3\\) on a unit circle shows that \\(\\tan\\left(4\\pi\/3\\right)\\) is closely related to \\(\\tan\\left(\\pi\/3\\right)\\). Remember \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}=\\frac{3\\pi}{3}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}=\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\)  We see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right) &amp; =\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3}\\quad\\textrm{ from the table.} \\end{align*}\\]    Exercises  What are the coordinates for points on the unit circle that make the following angles with the positive \\(x-\\)axis?  \\[\\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,30^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; b)\\,125^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; c)\\:-60^{\\circ}\\\\ d)\\,270^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; e)\\,-180^{\\circ} &amp; &amp; f)\\,720^{\\circ} \\end{array}\\]  Find exact values for:  \\[\\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\sin\\left(330^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; b)\\,\\cos\\left(210^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; c)\\,\\sin\\left(-30^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ d)\\,\\cos\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; e)\\,\\tan\\left(300^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; f)\\,\\cos\\left(180^{\\circ}\\right)\\\\ g)\\,\\sin\\left(-120^{\\circ}\\right) &amp; &amp; h)\\,\\cos\\left(315^{\\circ}\\right) \\end{array}\\]      ","excerpt":"The trigonometric ratios that have been defined in right-angled triangles can be extended to angles greater than 90 degrees Trigonometric functions such as sin, cos and tan are usually defined as the ratios of sides in a right angled triangle.

Sometimes they are referred to as piecewise defined functions.  Introduction Functions which have different rules for each subset of the domain are called hybrid functions. Sometimes they are referred to as piece-wise defined functions. An example of a hybrid function is: \\[\\begin{align*} y=f(x) &amp; =\\begin{cases} -x, &amp; x\\leq-1\\\\ 1, &amp; -1&lt;x&lt;1\\\\ x, &amp; x\\geq1. \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] Note that this hybrid function has three rules, each depending on the value of \\(x\\) in it\u2019s domain. A hybrid function may have two or more rules.   Example 1 Graph the hybrid function \\[\\begin{align*} y=f(x) &amp; =\\begin{cases} -x, &amp; x\\leq-1\\\\ 1, &amp; -1&lt;x&lt;1\\\\ x, &amp; x\\geq1. \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] Solution This is a hybrid function with three rules. We consider the graph of each of the rules, noting the restricted domains: \\(\\text{Rule 1. }y=-x\\) , \\(x\\leq-1\\)  Note that the end point at \\(x=-1\\) is marked with a filled in circle. This means \\(-1\\) is in the domain of the function. Rule 2. \\(y=1\\) , \\(-1&lt;x&lt;1\\)  In this case, the open circles indicate that the points \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) are not included in the domain of the function. Rule 3. \\(y=x\\) , \\(x\\geq1\\)  The \u201cgraphical pieces\u201d from rules \\(1\\) to \\(3\\) above can be put together to form the graph of the hybrid function \\[\\begin{align*} y=f(x) &amp; =\\begin{cases} -x, &amp; x\\leq-1\\\\ 1, &amp; -1&lt;x&lt;1\\\\ x, &amp; x\\geq1 \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] as shown below.

If a number is plotted on a number line then its absolute value can be considered to be the distance from zero.  Introduction The absolute value of a number gives a measure of its size or magnitude regardless of whether it is positive or negative. If a number is plotted on a number line then its absolute value can be considered to be the distance from zero. The absolute value of a number or a pro-numeral is designated by two vertical lines such as \\(\\left|\\,\\cdot\\,\\right|\\). For example the absolute value of the pro-numeral \\(x\\) is \\(\\left|x\\right|.\\)  Examples  \\(\\left|2\\right|=2\\) \\(\\left|-2\\right|=2\\) \\(\\left|-4+3\\right|=\\left|-1\\right|=1\\) \\(\\left|-8\\right|+\\left|-1\\right|=8+1=9\\) \\(\\left|x\\right|=7\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(x=7\\) or \\(x=-7\\)     The Absolute Value Function and its Graph The absolute value function is a hybrid function1 A hybrid function involves two or more cases. Each case depends on the domain of the function. defined as follows:2 In what follows, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers. \\[\\begin{align*} f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R},\\textrm{where $f(x)=$ $\\left|x\\right|$ } &amp; =\\begin{cases} -x, &amp; x&lt;0\\\\ x &amp; x\\geq0 \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] with graph  The domain of \\(f(x)\\)=\\(\\left|x\\right|\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the range of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\cup\\left\\{ 0\\right\\}\\). That is the set of all positive real numbers and zero. The graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) may be translated in the same way as the graphs of other functions. Compare the graphs of the following functions with that of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\)  The graph of \\(y=\\left|x-2\\right|\\) is shown below   and is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated horizontally two units to the right. 3 The graph of \\(y=\\left|x+2\\right|\\) is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) shifted two units to the left.  The graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|+1\\) is shown below   and is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated vertically one unit up. 4 The graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|-1\\) is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated vertically one unit down.  The graph of \\(y=3-\\left|x\\right|=-\\left|x\\right|+3\\) is shown below   and is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) reflected in the \\(x\\) axis followed by a vertical shift of three units up.   In general, to sketch the graph of \\(y=\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\), we need to sketch the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) first and then reflect in the \\(x\\)-axis the portion of the graph which is below the \\(x\\)-axis.    Sketch \\(\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=\\left|x^{2}-1\\right|\\right\\}\\)  The graph of this function is the graph of \\(y=x^{2}-1\\) with the portion below the \\(x\\)-axis reflected in the \\(x\\)-axis and is shown below:    Equations and Inequalities Involving \\(\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\) Because \\(y=\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\) is a hybrid function, two cases must be considered when solving equations and inequalities.  Examples  Solve \\(\\left|x-2\\right|=3\\)  Solution If \\(\\left|x-2\\right|=3\\) we must consider the two cases: \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =3+2\\\\ &amp; =5 \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =-3+2\\\\ &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3.\\)  Solve \\(\\left|2x+1\\right|=\\left|x-5\\right|\\).  Solution With an absolute value expression on each side of the equation it is easier to square both sides. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|2x+1\\right| &amp; =\\left|x-5\\right|\\\\ \\left(2x+1\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(x-5\\right)^{2}\\\\ 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =x^{2}-10x+25\\\\ 4x^{2}+4x+1-x^{2}+10x-25 &amp; =0\\\\ 3x^{2}+14x-24 &amp; =0\\\\ (3x-4)(x+6) &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] So \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-4 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{4}{3} \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} x+6 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =-6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is \\(x=4\/3\\) and \\(x=-6.\\)  Find the set of \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\left|\\frac{2-x}{3}\\right|&lt;4\\).  Solution: 5 Care must be taken when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number. In such cases the inequality is reversed. The answer to this type of question is in fact a set as it involves an infinite number of solutions. We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\frac{2-x}{3}\\right| &amp; &lt;4. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying each side by \\(3:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|2-x\\right| &amp; &lt;12 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} -12&lt;2-x &amp; &lt;12. \\end{align*}\\] Adding \\(2\\) to all sides we get: \\[\\begin{align*} -14&lt;-x &amp; &lt;10. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying by \\(-1\\), and noting the reversal of the inequality signs, \\[\\begin{align*} 14&gt;x &amp; &gt;-10\\,\\textrm{ or }-10&lt;x&lt;14. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is that \\(x\\) is greater than \\(-10\\) but less than \\(14\\) \\(.\\) More formally, this may be expressed as a set \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x\\in\\mathbb{R}:-10&lt;x&lt;14\\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\]  Find the set of \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\left|\\frac{x-2}{3}\\right|\\geq2\\).  Solution:  Multiply both sides by \\(3\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|x-2\\right| &amp; \\geq6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; \\geq6\\\\ x &amp; \\geq8 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; \\leq-6\\\\ x &amp; \\leq-4. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x:x\\leq-4\\right\\} &amp; \\cup\\left\\{ x:x\\geq8\\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\]    Exercise 1 Evaluate: \\(\\text{a) $\\left|-11\\right|\\quad\\text{b) $\\left|-9+4\\right|\\quad\\text{c) $-\\left|4\\right|-\\left|-5\\right|\\quad\\text{d) $\\left|-12\\right|-\\left|3\\right|\\quad\\text{e) $\\left|-30\\right|\\div\\left|5\\right|$ }$ }$ }$ }$ }\\)      Exercise 2 Sketch the graph of \\(\\text{a) $y=\\left|x+4\\right|\\quad\\quad\\text{b) $y=\\left|x-1\\right|-3\\qquad\\text{c) $y=\\left|3-x^{2}\\right|$ }$ }$ }\\)      Exercise 3 Find for \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) \\(\\text{a) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|x\\right|=6\\right\\} $ }\\) \\(\\text{b) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|x-1\\right|&lt;3\\right\\} $ }\\) \\(\\text{c) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|\\frac{x-3}{2}\\right|\\geq1\\right\\} $ }\\) \\(\\text{d) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|\\frac{x}{2}\\right|=\\left|x+2\\right|\\right\\} $ }\\)      Download this page, FG4 The Absolute Value Function (PDF 403 KB)   What's next...

Closed Interval Because the endpoints are included in the interval, this is called a closed interval and square brackets are used, eg. \\(\\left[2,5\\right]\\). The end points on the real number line are represented by solid circles (or square brackets).   Open Interval If the endpoints are not included in the interval, this is called an open interval and curved brackets are used, eg. \\(\\left(2,5\\right)\\). The end points on the real number line are represented by open circles (or curved brackets).  This is written in inequality notation as \\(a&lt;x&lt;b\\) . In interval notation as \\(\\left(a,b\\right)\\).   Examples  In interval notation the smaller number is always written to the left; i.e.\u00a0\\([-3,5)\\) not \\((5,-3]\\) Note: the symbol \\(\\infty\\) (infinity) is not a numeral. \\(\\infty\\) is the concept of continuing indefinitely to the right; \\(-\\infty\\) is the concept of continuing indefinitely to the left. Hence we cannot write \\(\\left[b,\\infty\\right]\\) , \\(\\left[-\\infty,a\\right]\\) or \\(b\\leq x\\leq\\infty\\) etc.    Examples  Write the following in inequality notation and graph on the real number line:    \\([-2,3)\\) Inequality notation: \\(-2\\leq x&lt;3\\)    \\((-\\infty,3]\\) Inequality notation: \\(x\\leq3\\)    Write the interval notation and inequality notation for the following line graphs:   Interval notation: \\((-5,6]\\) Inequality notation: \\(-5&lt;x\\leq6\\)  Interval notation: \\([10,\\infty)\\) Inequality notation: \\(x\\geq10\\) See Exercise 1.   Two Intervals Two (or more) subsets of \\(R\\), with end points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), respectively, can also be represented on a real number line.  Examples  Consider the line graph below:   This is written in interval notation as \\([a,b]\\cup[c,d]\\). The symbol \\(\\cup\\) means \u201cin union with\u201d. In inequality notation this may be written: \\(a\\leq x\\leq b\\) with \\(c\\leq x\\leq d\\) , or written as \\(\\left\\{ x:a\\leq x\\leq b\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{ x:c\\leq x\\leq d\\right\\}\\)  Consider the line graph below:   This is written in interval notation as \\((-\\infty,2]\\cup(5,12]\\). In inequality notation this may be written: \\(x\\leq2\\) with \\(5&lt;x\\leq12\\) , or written as \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\leq2\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{ x:5&lt;x\\leq12\\right\\}\\). See Exercises 2 and 3.    Exercises  Write the following inequalities in interval notation and graph on a real number line: (a) \\(1\\leq x&lt;10\\) (b) \\(-6\\leq x&lt;-4\\) (c) \\(x&gt;5\\) Write the following in interval notation and inequality notation:    Write the following in interval notation and inequality notation:    Write the following in interval notation and inequality notation:    Graph the following on the real number line and write in inequality notation: (a) \\(\\left(-\\infty,3\\right)\\cup(8,13]\\) (b) \\(\\left[-1,4\\right]\\cup\\left[6,9\\right]\\) (c) \\((-\\infty,3]\\cup\\left(6,\\infty\\right)\\)       Download this page, FG2 Interval Notation (PDF 329 KB)   What's next...

Relations A relation is a set of ordered pairs. For example \\((1,2),(2,6),(3,4),(x,y)\\) are ordered pairs and \\(\\left\\{ (1,2),(2,6),(3,4),(x,y)\\right\\}\\)is a relation. The domain of a relation is the set of first elements or the \\(x\\)-values of the ordered pairs. For the above ordered pairs the domain, dom = \\(\\left\\{ 1,2,3,x\\right\\}\\). The range of a relation is the set of second elements or the \\(y\\)-values of the ordered pairs. For the above ordered pairs the range, ran = \\(\\left\\{ 2,4,6,y\\right\\}\\). There is often a rule that links the domain and range. For example: 1 The symbol \\(\\in\\) means \u201cis in\u201d or \u201cis an element of\u201d , the symbol \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) stands for the set of real numbers. The expression \\[\\begin{align*} x\\in &amp; \\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\] means that \u201cx is an element of the set of real numbers\u201d. That is, \\(x\\) is a real number. \\[ S=\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y&gt;x,\\,x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\right\\} \\] This relation, called S, consists of the set of all ordered pairs (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)), where the \\(y\\) value is greater than the \\(x\\) value and where \\(x\\) must be a real number. Note that a relation is defined by its rule (in this case \\(y&gt;x\\)) and its domain (in this case \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\)).2 If the domain is not given then we assume the largest possible domain.  Example 1 Sketch the graph of the following relation and state the domain and range: \\[ \\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=x^{2}\\right\\} . \\]  In this example the rule joining the set of ordered pairs (\\(x,y\\)) is \\(y=x^{2}\\). \\(x\\) can be any real number. Domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}.\\) \\(y\\) must be greater than or equal to zero. Range is \\(\\left\\{ y:y\\geq0\\right\\}\\)   Example 2 Sketch the graph of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\). State the Domain and Range of this relation. In this example the rule joining the set of ordered pairs (\\(x,y\\)) is \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\).  From the graph it can be seen that the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:-2\\leq x\\leq2\\right\\}\\) and the range is \\(\\left\\{ y:-2\\leq y\\leq2\\right\\} .\\)   Example 3 Sketch the graph of \\(\\left\\{ (x,y):2x+3y=6,x\\geq0\\right\\}\\) and state the domain and range of this relation. In this example the rule joining the set of ordered pairs \\((x,y)\\) is \\(2x+3y=6\\). The restriction \\(x\\geq0\\) is placed on the domain.  The domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\geq0\\right\\}\\) as is specified in the statement of the relation. The range is \\(\\left\\{ y:y\\leq2\\right\\}\\) as can be seen from the graph. The rule of a relation may be thought of as: \\(\\textrm{DOMAIN$\\rightarrow\\textrm{RULE$\\rightarrow\\textrm{RANGE.}$ }$ }\\) Values taken from the domain produce values for the range, after passing through the rule that defines the relation.3 See Exercise 1    Functions From some of the previous examples it can be seen that some values in the domain (\\(x\\) values) may have many, even an infinite number of corresponding values in the range (\\(y\\) values). A function is a special type of relation. Each point in the domain of a function has a unique value in the range. Every value of \\(x\\) may have only one value of \\(y\\) .  Examples  The relation \\(\\left\\{ (-1,2),(-1,4),(1,6),(2,8),(3,10)\\right\\}\\) is not a function because the value \\(x=-1\\) has two corresponding \\(y\\) values \\((2\\textrm{ and}\\) \\(4)\\). The relation \\(\\left\\{ (-1,1),(0,2),(1,3),(2,5),(3,7)\\right\\}\\) is a function because for each \\(x\\) value there is only one corresponding \\(y\\) value. \\(F=\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=\\sin x,x\\in R\\right\\}\\)   If we choose any possible value of \\(x,\\) there exists only one corresponding value of \\(y\\). Therefore, the relation \\(F\\) is a function. Another way of writing this function is with mapping notation. \\[ f:X\\rightarrow Y,\\textrm{where $f(x)=\\sin x.$ } \\] (The domain, \\(X\\), is mapped onto the range, \\(Y\\), using the rule \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) ) If only the rule is given then we assume that the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).   Vertical Line Test When relations are represented graphically, a vertical line test may be applied to decide if they are functions. If a vertical line crosses the graph more than once, then it is not a function, as an \\(x\\) value has more than one \\(y\\) value.  The graph on the left is not a function (the vertical line crosses the graph more than once), the graph on the right is a function (vertical line only crosses the graph once). 4 See Exercise 2    Implied Domain If only the rule of the function is given, then we assume that the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (the set of real numbers) unless otherwise defined implicitly by the function.  Examples  If a function involves a square root, the domain, in the real number system, is restricted to those values of \\(x\\) that result in a non-negative number under the square root sign. So, the domain of the function \\(y=+\\sqrt{x-4}\\) is restricted such that \\(x-4\\geq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\geq4\\right\\}\\). The domain of the function \\(y=+\\sqrt{9-x^{2}}\\) is restricted such that \\(9-x^{2}\\geq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:-3\\leq x\\leq3\\right\\}\\). If the function involves a fraction, the value in the denominator must not equal zero. So, the domain of the function \\(y=\\dfrac{3}{x+5}\\) is restricted such that \\(x+5\\neq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\neq-5\\right\\}\\).5 The domain may be written as \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x:x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\left\\{ -5\\right\\} \\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\] Here \\(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\left\\{ -5\\right\\}\\) is the set of real numbers excluding \\(-5\\). The domain of the function \\(y=\\dfrac{3}{2x-8}\\) is restricted such that 2\\(x-8\\neq0\\) ; the domain is \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\neq4\\right\\}\\) or \\(\\left\\{ x:x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\left\\{ 4\\right\\} \\right\\}\\). 6 See Exercise 3     Exercises  Exercise 1. State the domain and range of the following relations  \\(\\left\\{ \\left(-2,1\\right),\\left(0,2\\right),\\left(2,5\\right),\\left(2,7\\right),\\left(3,9\\right)\\right\\}\\) \\(\\left\\{ \\left(4,1\\right),\\left(5,2\\right),\\left(6,3\\right)\\right\\}\\) \\(\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):x^{2}+y^{2}=25\\right\\}\\) \\(\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):2y=6-5x,x\\geq2\\right\\}\\)    Exercise 2.

These may be factorised down to numbers that may or may not be surds. Read this sheet to see how larger surds can be factorised out and expressed as a combination of both rational numbers and surds.  A surd is an expression that cannot be expressed exactly without a square root, cube root or other root symbol. Because surds are irrational numbers, in decimal form they contain an infinite number of non-recurring digits. Expressions like \\(\\sqrt{2},\\) \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8},}\\), \\(\\sqrt{20},\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{10},\\) \\(\\sqrt[4]{9},\\) are all surds but \\(\\sqrt{1},\\sqrt{9},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100},},\\sqrt{25},\\sqrt[3]{64},\\sqrt[4]{16},\\) are not because they can be written as \\(1,3,0.1,5,4\\) and \\(2\\) respectively. More complex expressions such as \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}\\) are also surds.  Simplifying Surds Rules for simplifying surds  \\(\\sqrt{a\\times b}=\\sqrt{a}\\times\\sqrt{b}\\) \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}\\)  If a square root surd has a square factor greater than \\(1,\\) that is, \\(4,9,16,25,36...\\) then it can be simplified. Similarly if a cube root surd has a cube factor greater than \\(1,\\) that is, \\(8,27,64,125,\\ldots\\), then it can be simplified.  Examples  Simplify \\(\\sqrt{200}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{200} &amp; =\\sqrt{100\\times2}\\ \\textrm{(factorize out the square factor)}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{100}\\times\\sqrt{2}\\ \\textrm{(using Rule 1)}\\\\ &amp; =10\\sqrt{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{24}}{2}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{24}}{2} &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{8\\times3}\\ }{2}\\textrm{(factorize out the cube factor)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{8}\\times\\sqrt[3]{3}}{2}\\ \\textrm{(using Rule 1)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2\\sqrt[3]{3}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt[3]{3}. \\end{align*}\\]     Addition and Subtraction of Surds Only like surds can be added or subtracted.  Examples  Simplify \\(8\\sqrt{5}-3\\sqrt{5}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 8\\sqrt{5}-3\\sqrt{5} &amp; =5\\sqrt{5}\\;\\;\\textrm{(just as $8x-5x=5x$ .)} \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(2\\sqrt{3}+5\\sqrt{7}-10\\sqrt{3}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\sqrt{3}+5\\sqrt{7}-10\\sqrt{3} &amp; =5\\sqrt{7}-8\\sqrt{3}\\;\\;(\\textrm{just as $2x+5y-10x=5y-8x.)$ } \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(\\sqrt{18}-\\sqrt{8}-\\sqrt{20}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{18}-\\sqrt{8}-\\sqrt{20} &amp; =\\sqrt{9\\times2}-\\sqrt{4\\times2}-\\sqrt{4\\times5}\\\\ &amp; =3\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{5}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{5}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that \\(\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{5}\\) cannot be simplified because \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) are not like surds.     Multiplication of Surds The following rule can be used to multiply terms containing surds: \\[\\begin{align*} a\\sqrt{b}\\times c\\sqrt{d} &amp; =ac\\sqrt{bd}. \\end{align*}\\]  Examples  Simplify \\(\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{3}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{3} &amp; =\\sqrt{6}. \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\times4\\sqrt{5}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\sqrt{3}\\times4\\sqrt{5} &amp; =12\\sqrt{15}. \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\times7\\sqrt{6}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\sqrt{10}\\times7\\sqrt{6} &amp; =14\\sqrt{60}\\ \\ (\\textrm{which can be simplified further)}\\\\ &amp; =14\\sqrt{4\\times15}\\\\ &amp; =14\\times2\\sqrt{15}\\\\ &amp; =28\\sqrt{15} \\end{align*}\\]     Division of Surds The rule \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\) may helpful in simplifying fractions that contain surds.  Examples  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{\\sqrt{6}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{18}{6}}=\\sqrt{3}\\). \\(\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{2}}=\\sqrt{8}=\\) \\(\\sqrt{2\\times4}=2\\sqrt{2}\\).     Expansion of Brackets The usual algebraic rules for removing brackets apply to brackets containing surds  \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)=ab+ac\\) \\(\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(c+d\\right)=ac+bc+ad+bd\\).   Examples  Simplify \\(\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}+5)\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}+5) &amp; =2+5\\sqrt{2} \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(\\left(\\sqrt{6}-4\\sqrt{3})\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{2}-3\\sqrt{5}\\right)\\).  \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(\\sqrt{6}-4\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{2}-3\\sqrt{5}\\right) &amp; =2\\sqrt{12}-8\\sqrt{6}-3\\sqrt{30}+12\\sqrt{15}\\\\ &amp; =2\\sqrt{4\\times3}-8\\sqrt{6}-3\\sqrt{30}+12\\sqrt{15}\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2\\times\\sqrt{3}-8\\sqrt{6}-3\\sqrt{30}+12\\sqrt{15}\\\\ &amp; =4\\sqrt{3}-8\\sqrt{6}-3\\sqrt{30}+12\\sqrt{15} \\end{align*}\\]    Rationalizing Denominators Sometimes fractions containing surds are required to be expressed with a rational denominator.  Examples  Rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}.\\) 1 Note that \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} &amp; =1 \\end{align*}\\] and so multiplication by \\(\\sqrt{5}\/\\sqrt{5}\\) does not change the value of \\(2\/\\sqrt{5}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} &amp; =\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\end{align*}\\] Rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3\\sqrt{2}} &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{6} \\end{align*}\\]     Conjugate Surds The pair of expressions \\(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}\\) are called conjugate surds. Each is the conjugate of the other. The product of two conjugate surds does NOT contain any surd term! That is, \\[ \\left(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}\\right)=(\\sqrt{a})^{2}-(\\sqrt{b})^{2}=a-b. \\] For example2 Factorization of a difference of two squares:\\(\\ \\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)=a^{2}-b^{2}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} (\\sqrt{10}+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{10}-\\sqrt{3}) &amp; =\\left(\\sqrt{10}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{3}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =10-3\\\\ &amp; =7. \\end{align*}\\] We make use of this property of conjugates to rationalize denominators of the form \\(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\) or \\(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}\\).  Example Rationalize the denominator of \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{5+\\sqrt{2}} &amp; . \\end{align*}\\] Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{5+\\sqrt{2}} &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{5+\\sqrt{2}}\\times\\frac{5-\\sqrt{2}}{5-\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\left(5-\\sqrt{2}\\right)}{\\left(5+\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(5-\\sqrt{2}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{6}}{5^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{6}}{25-2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{6}}{23} \\end{align*}\\]    Exercise 1 Simplify  \\(\\sqrt{500}\\) \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{20}}\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)+\\(\\sqrt{7}+3\\sqrt{2}-4\\sqrt{7}\\) \\(\\sqrt{54}-\\sqrt{24}\\) \\(\\sqrt{10}\\times3\\sqrt{10}\\) 2\\(\\sqrt{8}\\times2\\sqrt{50}\\times\\sqrt{2}\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{32}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) \\(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}\\times3\\sqrt{3}}{6\\sqrt{6}}\\)     Adding and Subtracting Fractions Involving Surds When adding or subtracting fractions containing surds it is generally advisable to first rationalize the denominators of each fraction.  Example Evaluate \\(\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}} &amp; =\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2}+1}\\times\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-1}{3\\sqrt{2}-1}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}}\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}}(\\textrm{rationalize denominators)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}-2}{18-1}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}}{3-2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}-2}{17}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}-2}{17}+\\frac{17\\left(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)}{17}(\\textrm{obtain a common denominator to add the fractions)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}-2+17\\left(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)}{17}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{23\\sqrt{2}-2+17\\sqrt{3}}{17}\\,. \\end{align*}\\]    Exercise 2  Expand and simplify if possible   \\(\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\sqrt{2}-8\\right)\\) \\(\\left(\\sqrt{11}+3\\right)\\) \\(\\left(\\sqrt{11}-3\\right)\\)    Express with a rational denominator   \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{\\sqrt{3}-2}\\)    Evaluate and express with a rational denominator  \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}-1}+\\frac{3}{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\)    Download this page, ILS 3.1 Simplifying Surds (PDF 198 KB)    ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1689 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: What happens if you want to take the root of larger surds?

These can be divided into two components, the normal (resisting) force pushing into the slope which produces friction and the shear or driving force pushing the block down the slope. So we must consider forces parallel and perpendicular to the slope.  Diagrams of forces acting on an inclined plane Just as we can analyse the horizontal and vertical components of the motion of an object separately, we can look at components parallel to, and perpendicular to, the sloping surface as well. The normal force of an object placed on a sloping surface is always perpendicular to the surface and the other forces are parallel to the surface. See diagrams below.  Forces acting on a block on an inclined plane: (At rest or slipping down the plane.)    Weight Force acting on a block resolved into its components: Perpendicular and parallel to the incline. Remember that the normal force \\(F_{N}\\) is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the object on the plane \\(mg\\cos\\theta\\) (perpendicular to plane) otherwise it would fall through the plane, and \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) (parallel to plane) forcing the object down the plane if no friction occurs.  To work out the angles remember sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees and remember a right angle is 90 degrees.   Note that with the above diagrams:  Weight \\(=mg\\); acts through the centre of mass. Normal force \\(F_{N}\\) is always at right angles to the surface. Friction acts to oppose sliding motion (eg, if the mass were being dragged uphill, friction would act downhill) The weight force is resolved into 2 components: \\(\\ \\ (1)\\ \\ \\) perpendicular to plane, and \\(\\ \\ (2)\\ \\ \\) parallel to the plane. The resultant force \\(\\Sigma F\\) down the slope is given by \\(\\Sigma F=mg\\sin\\theta-F_{f}\\) where \\(F_{f}\\) is friction The resultant force \\(\\Sigma F\\) perpendicular to the slope is zero (because it sits on the slope), hence: \\(mg\\cos\\theta=F_{N}\\)     Example: A toy car of mass \\(50g\\) travels down a smooth incline at \\(30\\) degrees to the horizontal. Calculate:  \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\)The net force acting on the car as it rolls down the slope, and \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\)The force of the incline on the car as it travels down the slope.  Friction may be ignored in this case. Gravity = 9.8\\(ms^{-2}\\).  Forces parallel to slope:  Note the angles: If slope is \\(30\\) degrees then \\(90-30=60\\) degrees in top corner then again \\(90-60=30\\) degrees from normal to vertical force so we would use \\(mg\\sin30\\) down the slope as the sum of all forces. (a)\\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\) As \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) is the component of the force parallel to the slope then \u201csum of all forces\u201d = \\(\\Sigma F\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ &amp; =mg\\sin\\theta-F_{f}\\\\ &amp; =mg\\sin\\theta-0\\\\ &amp; =mg\\sin\\theta \\end{align*}\\] Where \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) is the component of the force parallel to the slope. Note: the surface is friction-less (smooth) ie. \\(F_{f}=0\\), therefore the only force allowing the car to roll down the incline is the component of the gravitational force \u2018\\(mg\\sin\\theta\\)\u2019 . \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =mg\\sin\\theta\\\\ &amp; =m\\times g\\times\\sin\\theta\\\\ &amp; =50\\times10^{-3}\\times9.8\\times\\sin30\\\\ &amp; =0.25N \\end{align*}\\] Note: grams have been converted into kilograms   Forces perpendicular to slope:  Also note the angles: If slope is \\(30\\) degrees then \\(90-30=60\\) degrees in top corner then again \\(90-60=30\\) degrees from normal to vertical force so we use \\(mg\\cos30\\) perpendicular to the slope as the normal force. (b)\\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\) The force of the incline on the car is a force that acts perpendicular to the slope, ie. the normal force \\(F_{N}\\) is equal to \\(mg\\cos\\theta\\) \\[\\begin{align*} F_{N} &amp; =mg\\cos\\theta\\\\ &amp; =m\\times g\\times\\cos\\theta\\\\ &amp; =50\\times10^{-3}\\times9.8\\times\\cos30\\\\ &amp; =0.43N \\end{align*}\\]    Trivia The steepest road in the world is in Dunedin, New Zealand. It has an incline of \\(52\\) degrees. Ignoring friction, a car left with its handbrake off would accelerate down this street at: \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =g\\times\\sin\\theta\\\\ &amp; =9.8\\times\\sin52\\\\ &amp; =7.7ms^{-2} \\end{align*}\\] Hint: always draw the diagram of what is happening. The force along the slope is \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) so \\(\\Sigma F=ma=mg\\sin\\theta\\) since there is no frictional force.

For instance, you say to a friend that you have gained \\(3kg\\) during the past three months. If you say just three without kilograms, it won't make sense to your friend as three can be in any units we use to measure mass, such as grams, miligrams, kilograms, pounds etc. Therefore, adding a unit next to a quantity is essential to get the correct information.  A physical quantity can be measured in several units. For instance, weight can be expressed in kilograms, grams, pounds etc. Therefore, scientists have introduced standard units for each physical quantity to avoid confusion. This system is known as the international system of units (SI Units). Some SI units and symbols    Quantity Unit Symbol     Mass Kilogram \\(kg\\)   Length Metre \\(m\\)   Volume Cubic metre \\(m^{3}\\)   Temperature Kelvin \\(K\\)   Time Second \\(s\\)   Electric current Ampere \\(A\\)   Amount of substance Mole \\(mol\\)   Luminous intensity Candela \\(cd\\)    A common issue associated with any measuring system is that depending on the quantity, the unit we use might be inconvenient to express. For instance, expressing the diameter of a bacterial cell \\(\\left(0.0000001m\\right)\\) in metres is challenging. Therefore, prefixes have been introduced to express such measurements. The multiples and fractions of SI units are expressed with prefixes. Common SI and matrix unit prefixes    Prefix Symbol Multiplied by     giga G \\(10^{9}\\)   mega M \\(10^{6}\\)   kilo \\(k\\) \\(10^{3}\\)   deci \\(d\\) \\(10^{-1}\\)   centi \\(c\\) \\(10^{-2}\\)   milli \\(m\\) \\(10^{-3}\\)   micro \\(\\mu\\) \\(10^{-6}\\)   nano \\(n\\) \\(10^{-9}\\)   pico \\(p\\) \\(10^{-12}\\)     Unit Conversions We can use conversion factors to convert one unit to another. For instance, conversion of miligrams to grams. From prefixes we know&nbsp;\\[ 1000mg=1g \\] Both \\(1000mg\\) and \\(1g\\) refer to the same amount, but in different units. Based on this relationship we can create pair of conversion factors \\[ \\frac{1000mg}{1g}\\:\\:\\textrm{and}\\:\\:\\frac{1g}{1000mg} \\] Express \\(150.0mg\\) in grams? We can calculate \\(150mg\\) in grams using the conversion factor \\(\\frac{1g}{1000mg}\\) as follows \\[ \\frac{1g}{1000mg}\\times150.0mg=0.1500g \\] Express \\(0.275g\\) in milligrams? Here we can use the other conversion factor \\(\\frac{1000mg}{1g}\\) as follows \\[ \\frac{1000mg}{1g}\\times0.275g=275mg \\] When you observe these two calculations, you can identify that the conversion factor used from the pair depends on the unit required to be converted. Other Conversions Time To change from hours to seconds we multiply by 3600 since there are (60 x 60) seconds in 1 hour. Conversely, we divide by 3600 to change from seconds to hours. Multiple conversions Velocity may be given in km\/h. To change to m\/s involves two conversions: 1 km\/h = 1000 m\/h = (1000\/3600) m\/s = (1\/3.6) ms Examples 60 km\/h = (60\/3.6) = 16.7 m\/s.

This theory can not explain why compounds without hydroxyl groups behave as bases, such as ammonia generating a basic aqueous solution.\nBronsted-Lowry acid-base theory\nDue to the limitations in the Arrhenius acid-base theory, the Bronsted-Lowry Acid-Base Theory was introduced.\n\nBronsted-Lowry acid: any substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (or a proton) to another substance.\n\nBronsted-Lowry base: any substance that can accept a hydrogen ion (or a proton) from another substance1 \\(=\\) hydrogen ion\/proton acceptor\n\nBronsted-Lowry acids can donate a different number of hydrogen ions. For instance, \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) and \\(\\ce{HNO}_{3}\\) can donate one hydrogen ion (monoprotic acids), \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) is capable of donating two hydrogen ions (diprotic acids), and \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) can donate three hydrogen ions (triprotic acids).\n\nNot all hydrogens are acidic. Only the hydrogens bound to highly electronegative atoms such as oxygen and chlorine can be released as protons or hydrogen ions. Hydrogens in the examples above, \\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{HNO}_{3}\\), \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\), and \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) are all acidic as those hydrogens are bound to \\(\\ce{Cl}\\), \\(\\ce{O}\\).

Proton donation and acceptance are complementary processes. For instance, consider the following reactions:\n\n \tWhen \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) gas dissolves\u00a0in water - \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) donates the proton to the water (Bronsted-Lowry acid). The polar water molecules accept the proton (Bronsted-Lowry base) and become\u00a0hydronium ions.

The \\('H'\\) represents the hydrogen atom, and the \\('A'\\) represents the rest of the acid.\n\nBronsted-Lowry bases are denoted by \\(\\ce{B}\\colon\\) as the main requirement of a Bronsted-Lowry base is to bear a lone pair of electrons.\n\nThe general equation of the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction can be written as the following: \\[ \\ce{HA}+\\ce{B}\\colon\\rightarrow\\ce{A}^{-}+\\left[\\ce{B}\\colon\\ce{H}\\right]^{+} \\]\nConjugate acid-base pairs\nMany Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reactions are reversible.\n\nLet's consider the general equation for the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction.

For instance, \\(\\ce{HA}\\) (conjugate acid) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) (conjugate base).\n\n\n\nIn a conjugate acid-base pair, acid always has one more hydrogen atom than the base. For instance, \\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\) (acetic acid) dissociation in water. \\[ \\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COO}^{-}+\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+} \\]\n\n\\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\/\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COO}^{-}\\) \\(=\\) conjugate acid-base pair. \\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\) has one hydrogen atom greater than the \\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COO}^{-}\\) ion.

Strong acids can transfer nearly all (100%) of their protons (hydrogen ions) to the water. Weak acids can only transfer some of their protons to the water.\n\nThe extent of electron transfer depends on the molecular structure of acids.

For instance, hydrochloric acid (\\(\\ce{HCl}\\)). If hydrogen is bound to a less electronegative atom like carbon, the bond is not polar enough to release hydrogen. For instance, hydrogen bound to carbon in acetic acid (\\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\)). Acetic acid has four hydrogens: one bound to oxygen and the other three to carbon. Only the hydrogen bound to oxygen is released as acidic hydrogen, making acetic acid a weak acid. \\[\\begin{align*} \\ce{HCl}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right) &amp; \\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\left(aq\\right)\\\\ \\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right) &amp; \\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COO}^{-}\\left(aq\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nMost of the acids are weak acids. The common strong acids are listed below.\n\n\n\nChemical formula\nName\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HCl}\\)\nHydrochloric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HBr}\\)\nHydrobromic acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HI}\\)\nHydroiodic acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HNO}_{3}\\)\nNitric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO}_{3}\\)\nChloric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO}_{4}\\)\nPerchloric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\)\nSulfuric acid\n\n\n\nIn a strong acid, dissociation equilibrium lies more to the right side as dissociation is closer to 100%. For a weak acid, equilibrium lies more to the left side. Therefore, in a solution of a strong acid, dominant species are \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\), while that in a weak acid is \\(\\ce{HA}\\).\n\nStrong Bases and Weak Bases\nStrong bases show a high affinity for protons in an aqueous solution. For instance, \\(\\ce{NaOH}\\), \\(\\ce{KOH}\\) and hydroxides of main group one and two elements in the periodic table.\n\nWeak bases show less affinity for protons in aqueous solutions. For instance, the solution of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) gas in water.\n\n\n\nIn a solution of a strong base, the equilibrium lies more towards the right side. Therefore the dominant species in the solution are \\(\\ce{BH}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{OH}^{-}\\). In a solution of a weak base, the equilibrium lies more towards the left, which means the dominant species in the solution is \\(\\ce{B}\\).\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between the strength of an acid and the strength of a base. The conjugate base of a strong acid is always a weak base, and the conjugate base of a weak acid is always a strong base. This relationship can be explained using the definition of a strong\/weak acid and strong\/weak base. The strong acid has the capacity to completely (nearly 100%) dissociate in water to donate protons, which means its conjugate base has less affinity to protons as the reaction equilibrium favours towards the right side (forward reaction predominates). A base showing less affinity for protons is a weak base. Similarly, in water, the weak acid partially dissociates to produce protons, which means its conjugate base displays a high affinity for the protons, as reaction equilibrium lies towards the left (reverse reaction predominates). Therefore, the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base, and the weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate base.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcids and Bases Ionisation Constants\nThe strengths of acids and bases can be quantified using ionisation constants.\n\nDissociation of a weak acid in water can be written as: \\[ \\ce{HA}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(l\\right)\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\left(aq\\right)+\\ce{A}^{-}\\left(aq\\right) \\]\n\nIonisation constant is a form of the equilibrium constant. Therefore, the ionisation constant of the above reaction can be written as follows: \\[ K_{a}=\\frac{\\left[\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\right]\\left[\\ce{A}^{-}\\right]}{\\left[\\ce{HA}\\right]} \\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\(K_{a}\\)= acid ionisation\/dissociation constant\n\nWater is not included in the ionisation constant expression as water is a pure liquid. The concentrations of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\)and \\(\\ce{HA}\\) are experimentally determined to calculate the ionisation constant. We can predict the strength of an acid using the acid ionisation constant. The strength of an acid is directly proportional to the acid ionisation constant. Strong acids have large \\(K_{a}\\)values (\\(&gt;1\\)) as a forward reaction is favoured, leading to a larger concentration of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) than \\(\\ce{HA}\\). Weak acids possess \\(K_{a}\\) values less than \\(1\\), as ionisation (forward reaction) is not favoured.\n\n1Electronegativity (EN) is the power in an atom in a molecule to attract electrons.\n\n","excerpt":"What is the difference between a strong and a weak acid?

Everyone is different;&nbsp;we have different ways of approaching problems and the work we do. That doesn't mean there's one way of working that will suit everyone, and there isn't one technique that will help everyone remain focused on a task. Being able to manage your time well means you will find tasks less stressful and have more free time. One of the best ways to ensure you get the most out of your time is to implement strategies to stop procrastination in its tracks.   \"In many ways, procrastination is a fundamental law of the universe. It's Newton's first law applied to productivity. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.\" - James Clear  Reasons you might be procrastinating Procrastination isn't laziness. Most people don't like procrastinating and want to change their work habits and behaviours. There are many reasons why you may find yourself avoiding certain tasks, such as:  thinking that the task is too difficult or not interesting; fear of failure or judgement; anxiety, depression or low self esteem; having multiple tasks with looming deadlines; other factors in your life like home, family or work issues that get in the way.  What can you do about it? Understand your ideal workspace We can't always have a distraction-free environment, but we can remove the distractions that may stop us reaching our goals. Being aware of what distractions exist can help you minimise their effect. Identify when you are procrastinating It's never too early to start an assignment! You may be doing things that are keeping you busy instead of getting work done. This could include:  preparing your workspace rather than working at&nbsp;it; actively seeking distractions, such as checking your phone for updates, or starting new conversations with people online; if you're at home, you may prioritise housework over your studies.  Tips to break procrastination cycles  Set small goals (unrelated ones are ok) to evidence achievement. Break a big task into small pieces to make it easier to start working. What are the easy solutions? Study with your friends - \"Shut up and write\". Eliminate distractions &ndash; study in a quiet place like your University Library. Explore tools like the Forest app, modify your phone (or computer) settings to only allow interruptions from important people. You can turn off notifications on your devices or set them to 'focus' mode. Write up a 'Done' list as an alternative as a 'To-Do' list to remind&nbsp;yourself of your accomplishments. This may help break procrastination cycles if you feel you don't have momentum. Plan regular times to focus on studying. Having a regular time to do something each day helps to form a good work habit.  Still having trouble focusing or getting things done? These are established systems used by others to remain focused, and are popular worldwide. They might help break some bad habits when you're studying. Pomodoro Technique This technique involves choosing a task and working on it in 25-minute bursts followed by short breaks, as directed by a timer. After 4 Pomodoros, you can take a longer break. An online pomodoro timer that might help you stick to your task is Pomofocus. SMART goals SMART goals are those that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:\n\n\n\nExample 1\nDivide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\)\n\nFirst we set up the long division by writing\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\n\nNow we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down.\nDivide\nDivide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\nMultiply\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\]\nSubtract\nSubtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\]\nBring down\nBring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nWe now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero.\nDivide\nDivide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\nMultiply\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\]\nSubtract\nSubtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nThis is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) In other words4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nDividing a higher order polynomial\nThe basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.\n\nExample 2\nDivide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\n\nFirst we write the long division as shown below:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\n\nWe then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down.\nDivide\nDivide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\). That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(x^{3}\\) to get \\(x^{2}\\) and write\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\nMultiply\nMultiply \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) and write as below:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\end{array}\\]\nSubtract\nSubtract \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}\\)and write as:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2\\phantom{bbbi+11x)} \\end{array}\\]\nBring down\nBring down the \\(11x\\) term and write as:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\nDivide\nWe now repeat the algorithm. We divide the highest power of \\(x-1\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\). That is, we divide \\(x\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x\\) and write as follows.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,\\,-5x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\nMultiply\nMultiply \\(-5x\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) and write:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\end{array}\\]\nSubtract\nSubtract \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) from \\(-5x^{2}+11x\\) to get \\(6x\\) and write:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ - \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x \\phantom{)-6} \\end{array}\\]\nBring down\nBring down the \\(-6\\) and write as\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\nDivide\nDivide the leading term of \\(x-1\\) into the leading term of \\(6x-6.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(6x\\) to get \\(6\\) and write as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\nMultiply\nMultiply \\(x-1\\) by \\(6\\) and write as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\end{array}\\]\nSubtract\nSubtract \\(6x-6-\\left(6x-6\\right)\\) to get \\(0\\) and write as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nAs there are no more terms to bring down, we stop the algorithm. Our result is that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThis is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6=\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThis is probably the best interpretation as we can then factorise the quadratic term on the RHS to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Which is of value when we are trying to graph \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\) as it gives us the \\(x-\\)intercepts of the function.\n\n\n\nExample 3\nDivide \\(\\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\n\nThe major difference from example 2 above is that there is no \\(x^{2}\\) term in \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1. \\end{align*}\\] We get around this by writing \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =2x^{3}+0x^{2}-3x+1 \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThat is, we set up the long division as\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\n\nand apply the algorithm used in Example 1 and 2 above.\n\nApplying the algorithm we obtain:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nHence we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =2x^{2}+2x-1 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\times\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\nIn your work, the final result as shown above is all that is required. That is you would write:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nThe steps (divide, multiply, subtract, bring down) identified in Examples \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are for explanation only. You do not have to make reference to them.\n\nPlease try Exercise 1.\n\n\n\n\nThe factor theorem\nSolution of a cubic equation is frequently required in maths, science and engineering.\n\nThe long division of polynomials described above is an important tool in this. However the Factor Theorem is equally important.\n\nThe Factor Theorem states:\n\n\n\nIf \\(P(x)\\) is a polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(P(a)=0\\) then \\((x-a)\\) is a factor of \\(P(x)\\). We can use the factor theorem to find one factor of a polynomial, and then use polynomial long division to find the remaining factor(s).\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\nSolve the equation \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0.\\)\n\nWe first use the Factor Theorem to try and get a linear factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24.\\) Let \\[ P\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 \\] then letting \\(x=1,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(1\\right) &amp; =1-5-2+24\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\n\nNow try \\(x=-1\\) to get, \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1-5+2+24\\\\ &amp; =20\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)=\\left(x+1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\n\nNow try \\(x=2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(2\\right) &amp; =8-20-4+24\\\\ &amp; =8\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-2\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\n\nNow try \\(x=-2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =-8-20+4+24\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-2\\right)\\right)=x+2\\) is factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\). We now use polynomial division to divide \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\) by \\(x+2.\\) We have\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2-7x+12\\phantom{)} \\\\ x+2{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-5x^2-2x+24\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3+ 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- 7x^2 \\,-2x\\phantom{bbbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-7x^2-\\!14x)}\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ 12x+24 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(12x+24)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\n\nThat is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\right)\\div\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\\\ x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\left(x+2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The quadratic on the RHS may be factorised as 5 This can be done by inspection, or more formally using the quadratic formula which says for a quadratic equation: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0,\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] In our case \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-\\left(-7\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{49-4\\left(1\\right)12}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{1}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =4\\text{ or $3$ .} \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-7x+12 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solutions to \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0\\), are \\(x=4\\), \\(x=3\\) and \\(x=-2.\\)\n\nPlease try Exercise 2 below.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\\(\\quad\\)a.

Properties of perfect squares will help you in factorising and expanding algebraic expressions. An understanding of perfect squares is essential for success in mathematics.\nA perfect square is something like \\(5^{2}, x^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\). In this module we deal with perfect squares of the form: \\(\\left(x\\pm y\\right)^{2} =x^{2}\\pm2xy+y^{2}.\\)These forms are very common in mathematics and help us simplify expressions. They are important to know if you are an engineering or science student.\n\nIs this quadratic a perfect square? Some quadratics (but not all) are perfect squares. This means they can be factorised neatly into the form of (a+b) (a-b). Find out if your quadratic can be factorised in this simple way.\n\n\nExamples of perfect squares are \\(5^{2},\\,x^{2},\\,a^{2}b^{2},\\,\\left(xy\\right)^{2}\\) and \\(\\left(a\\pm b\\right)^{2}.\\) For your development of algebraic skills, the most interesting of these are \\(\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}\\) and \\(\\left(a-b\\right)^{2}.\\)\n\n\n\nRules for expanding perfect squares\nConsider \\(\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)\\text{ by definition}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+ab+ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Similarly, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\text{ by definition}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-ab-ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] You must remember the equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\).

Properties of perfect squares will help you in factorising and expanding algebraic expressions. An understanding of perfect squares is essential for success in mathematics. A perfect square is something like \\(5^{2}, x^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\). In this module we deal with perfect squares of the form: \\(\\left(x\\pm y\\right)^{2} =x^{2}\\pm2xy+y^{2}.\\)These forms are very common in mathematics and help us simplify expressions.

The method of partial fractions involves breaking up an algebraic fraction into simpler parts that are added together. This is useful in integration and in finding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding fractions\r\nTo add fractions, we rewrite the fractions with common denominator and then add the numerators.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3}{3x+4}+\\frac{2}{x-5} &amp; =\\frac{3}{(3x+4)}\\times\\frac{(x-5)}{(x-5)}+\\frac{2}{(x-5)}\\times\\frac{(3x+4)}{(3x+4)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(x-5)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}+\\frac{2(3x+4)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(x-5)+2(3x+4)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3x-15+6x+8}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9x-7}{(3x+4)(x-5)}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding partial fractions\r\nThe reverse of this process is to split a fraction into partial fractions.\r\n\r\nIn the above example,1 The partial fractions are \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3}{3x+4} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{2}{x-5}\\,. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{9x-7}{(3x+4)(x-5)} &amp; =\\dfrac{3}{3x+4}+\\dfrac{2}{x-5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe first step in finding partial fractions is to factorise the denominator. The factorisation will determine the form of the partial fractions: \\[\\begin{align*} 1.\\, &amp; \\text{Distinct linear factors$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(x+a)(x+b)}=\\frac{A}{x+a}+\\frac{B}{x+b}\\\\ 2.\\, &amp; \\text{Repeated linear factors$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(x+a)^{2}}=\\frac{A}{x+a}+\\frac{B}{(x+a)^{2}}\\\\ 3.\\, &amp; \\text{Quadratic and linear factor$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(ax^{2}+bx+c)(px+q)}=\\frac{Ax+B}{ax^{2}+bx+c}+\\frac{C}{px+q}. \\end{align*}\\] The last step is to determine the constants \\(A,\\,B\\) and \\(C.\\) This is discussed in a later section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of partial fractions\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2x+1}{x^{2}+3x+2} &amp; =\\frac{2x+1}{(x+2)(x+1)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+2}+\\frac{B}{x+1}\\\\ \\\\ \\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x^{2}+4x+4)} &amp; =\\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x+2)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{2x-1}+\\frac{B}{x+2}+\\frac{C}{(x+2)^{2}}\\\\ \\\\ \\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x^{2}+4x+5)} &amp; =\\frac{A}{2x-1}+\\frac{Bx+C}{x^{2}+4x+5} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) cannot be factorised into two linear factors.\r\n\r\nImportant point\r\nThe process of finding partial fractions can only be performed on fractions where the degree of the numerator of the algebraic fraction is less than the degree of the denominator (that is, the greatest power of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d on the top of the fraction must be less than the greatest power of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d on the bottom of the fraction). If necessary, divide the denominator into the numerator and then express the remaining fractional part as partial fractions.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{x^{2}+7x+7}{x^{2}+3x+2} &amp; =1+\\dfrac{4x+5}{x^{2}+3x+2}\\\\ &amp; =1+\\dfrac{4x+5}{(x+2)(x+1)}\\\\ &amp; =1+\\dfrac{3}{x+2}+\\dfrac{1}{x+1}\\quad\\text{(After calculating partial fractions)} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nRewrite each of the following in the appropriate generalised partial fraction form (do not calculate the constants).\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{x+6}{2x^{2}+5x-12}\\qquad\\text{b)$\\;\\dfrac{2x}{(x^{2}+3)(x+1)}$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{c)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{2x}{x^{2}+8x+16}$ $\\qquad\\text{d)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{x^{2}}{x^{2}-1}$ .}$ }\\)2 Hint: If the power of \\(x\\) in the numerator is greater than or equal to that of the denominator, first perform a long division and then factorise the resulting algebraic fraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermining the constants\r\nThe constants \\(A,\\,B\\) and \\(C\\) are determined using simultaneous equations or substitution of particular values of \\(x.\\) Both these methods are explained in the following examples.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Simultaneous equations\r\nExpress \\(\\dfrac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\) as a sum of partial fractions.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{(x-1)(x+3)} \\end{align*}\\] This is a case of distinct linear factors so \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{(x-1)(x+3)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{x+3} &amp; \\left(1.1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+3)}+\\frac{B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+3)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A(x+3)+B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+3)}. &amp; \\left(1.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] From equation \\(\\left(1.1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(1.2\\right)\\),\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x-5 &amp; =A(x+3)+B(x-1) &amp; \\left(1.3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =Ax+3A+Bx-B\\\\ &amp; =(A+B)x+(3A-B). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nEquating terms involving \\(x\\) and constants on the LHS and RHS gives: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =(A+B)x\\\\ 1 &amp; =A+B\\text{ assuming $x\\neq0,$ } &amp; \\left(1.4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} -5 &amp; =3A-B\\:. &amp; \\left(1.5\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nEquations \\(\\left(1.4\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(1.5\\right)\\) may be solved simultaneously.3 There are several way of doing this. The method we use is not unique. However any valid method will lead to the same solution for \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\)\r\n\r\nAdding equations \\(\\left(1.4\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(1.5\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} -4 &amp; =4A\\\\ 4A &amp; =-4\\\\ A &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this result in equation \\(\\left(1.4\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 1 &amp; =-1+B\\\\ B &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nUsing equations \\(\\left(1.1\\right)\\) with \\(A=-1\\) and \\(B=2\\) gives the solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{-1}{x-1}+\\frac{2}{x+3}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1 alternative method\r\nIn the solution above we reached this step (see equation \\(\\left(1.3\\right)\\)): \\[\\begin{align*} x-5 &amp; =A(x+3)+B(x-1). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nInstead of equating coefficients and solving simultaneous equations, we can often solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) by substituting any convenient value of \\(x\\) into this equation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we let \\(x=1\\) we can eliminate \\(B\\) from the equation and solve for \\(A\\).\r\n\r\nIf \\(x=1\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 1-5 &amp; =A(1+3)+B(1-1)\\\\ -4 &amp; =A(4)+B(0)\\\\ -4 &amp; =4A\\\\ A &amp; =-1 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIf we let \\(x=-3\\) we can eliminate \\(A\\) and solve for \\(B\\).\r\n\r\nIf \\(x=-3\\) \\[\\begin{align*} -3-5 &amp; =A(-3+3)+B(-3-1)\\\\ -8 &amp; =A(0)+B(-4)\\\\ -8 &amp; =-4B\\\\ B &amp; =2\\\\ \\textrm{Therefore}\\\\ \\frac{x-5}{(x-1)(x+3)} &amp; =\\frac{-1}{x-1}+\\frac{2}{x+3} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis method, of course, gives the same answer as when you equate coefficients and solve simultaneous equations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nExpress \\(\\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{x^{3}-3x-2}\\) as the sum of partial fractions. \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{x^{3}-3x-2} &amp; =\\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)}\\quad\\textrm{ [factorise the denominator]}\\\\ \\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)} &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+1}+\\dfrac{B}{(x+1)^{2}}+\\frac{C}{x-2}\\quad\\textrm{ [repeated linear factors]}\\\\ \\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)} &amp; =\\dfrac{A(x+1)(x-2)+B(x-2)+C(x+1)^{2}}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)}\\quad\\textrm{ [finding a common denominator]}\\\\ 5x^{2}+3x+1 &amp; =A(x+1)(x-2)+B(x-2)+C(x+1)^{2}\\quad\\textrm{ [equating numerators]} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can now substitute any convenient value for \\(x\\). 4 Here we are using the alternate method described in Example 1 above.\r\n\r\nLet \\(x=2\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 5x^{2}+3x+1 &amp; =A(x+1)(x-2)+B(x-2)+C(x+1)^{2}\\\\ \\textrm{substitute $x=2$ }\\\\ 5(2)^{2}+3(2)+1 &amp; =A(2+1)(2-2)+B(2-2)+C(2+1)^{2}\\\\ 27 &amp; =A(0)+B(0)+9C\\\\ 27 &amp; =9C\\\\ C &amp; =3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nLet \\(x=-1\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 5x^{2}+3x+1 &amp; =A(x+1)(x-2)+B(x-2)+C(x+1)^{2}\\\\ 5(-1)^{2}+3(-1)+1 &amp; =A(-1+1)(-1-2)+B(-1-2)+C(-1+1)^{2}\\\\ 3 &amp; =A(0)+B(-3)+C(0)\\\\ 3 &amp; =-3B\\\\ B &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSubstitute in the values of \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) and let \\(x=0\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 5x^{2}+3x+1 &amp; =A(x+1)(x-2)+B(x-2)+C(x+1)^{2}\\\\ 5(0)^{2}+3(0)+1 &amp; =A(0+1)(0-2)+(-1)(0-2)+(3)(0+1)^{2}\\\\ 1 &amp; =-2A+2+3\\\\ 1-2-3 &amp; =-2A\\\\ -4 &amp; =-2A\\\\ A &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSince \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)} &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+1}+\\dfrac{B}{(x+1)^{2}}+\\frac{C}{x-2}\\\\ \\Longrightarrow\\dfrac{5x^{2}+3x+1}{(x+1)^{2}(x-2)} &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+1}-\\dfrac{1}{(x+1)^{2}}+\\frac{3}{x-2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nExpress \\(\\dfrac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\) as a sum of partial fractions.\r\n\r\nWe have\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\dfrac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{2}(x-5)+(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\dfrac{x^{2}-3x+16}{(x^{2}+1)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\dfrac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\dfrac{C}{x-5}\\text{} &amp; \\left(3.1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\dfrac{(Ax+B)(x-5)}{(x^{2}+1)(x-5)}+\\dfrac{C(x^{2}+1)}{(x-5)(x^{2}+1)} \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-3x+16 &amp; =(Ax+B)(x-5)+C(x^{2}+1)\\\\ &amp; =Ax^{2}-5Ax+Bx-5B+Cx^{2}+C\\\\ &amp; =(A+C)x^{2}+(-5A+B)x+(-5B+C) &amp; \\left(3.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Equating terms on the LHS and RHS we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x^{2}\\quad$ }1 &amp; =A+C &amp; \\left(3.3\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $x\\quad$ }-3 &amp; =-5A+B &amp; \\left(3.4\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $x^{0}=\\text{constant$\\quad$ }$ }16 &amp; =-5B+C &amp; \\left(3.5\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe need to solve these simultaneously.5 As mentioned previously, there are several approaches we can use.

Since the 2007 financial crisis, Australian banks have paid more than $1 billion in fines and compensation from rorting their own clients. Who was leading the banks? The Commonwealth Bank chief executive had been with the bank for about two decades, Westpac had a senior executive at the bank since 2012, and worked at ANZ in the early 2000s, while the ANZ CEO had been at the bank since 2009, with decades in the industry (Montague et. al. 2016). It is clear that this in senior management roles have to be held accountable for this track record of financial scandals. Former federal treasurer Peter Costello has issued a scathing critique of the banking sector and the role of Australia's corporate regulators in contributing to a culture of dishonest and corrupt behaviours. He inferred that \"their inadequate supervision, with its focus on financial stability whilst ignoring other looming problems, enabled the big banks to behave 'appallingly'\". In December 2017 the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (hereafter referred to as the 'Royal Commission') (Australian Government, 2019) was established to explore possible breaches of financial services laws which were at risk of jeopardising the financial wellbeing of the Australian community. The Commission identified a vast array of areas where the financial sector clearly needs to make significant changes and improvements to address sustained corrupt financial practices. Key argument 3 The banking industry has received a strong message that they must change or they will be changed. The public despise them. Tens of thousands of honest bankers, who understandably held a position of great trust in the community, have been tarnished by the actions of a few, but the culture of many. Royal Commission Chair, Hayne, asserted that the \"[T]he community expects that financial services entities that break the law will be held to account,\" Hayne writes. The work of the commission has shown that not only has the law \"not been obeyed\", it has also \"not been enforced effectively\" (Australian Government, 2019). Banking needs to change, to focus on customers and root out wrongdoing.

ContentionClaimStrongWeakAssumptionLanguageShow all Introduction The global financial crisis of 2007 (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis so severe that is was labelled as the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Yet many economists argue that the problem could have been avoided, if ideologues supporting the economics models of the time weren't so vocal, influential and inconsiderate of others' viewpoints and concerns. As the negative consequences of the GFC unfolded in Australia, key influencers demanded that lessons be learned so as to minimise the risk of such events occurring in the future. Key critics are concerned that, despite calls from key regulatory agencies for rapid and widespread change to offset the risk of a future financial crisis, little has changed leaving the Australian finance sector vulnerable to future economic collapse.  Key argument 1 The global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007 rocked the global banking and financial sectors however, the lessons learned from the GFC have not heeded by the Australian Banking Sector. The 2007 GFG witnessed the loss of trillions of dollars from banking and finance sectors worldwide resulting in the collapse of banks, economies and devastating the personal lives of millions (Montague et. al. 2016). We have all been affected by this collapse yet, despite this state of destruction,with over 70 inquiries or reviews into related aspects of the Australian financial services industry since 2007, little has changed to ensure better protection for the Australian financial section (APRA, www.apra. gov.au). Australia has a limited number of large banks on a comparative global scale but all are well capitalised and underpinned by a robust retail base, developed capabilities in regard to wealth management and fully serviced activities in trade finance and commercial and corporate advisory infrastructure impacting on the South East Asian Region (Austrade, 2011). However, the reputations of the Australian banks are tarnished too as they have harmed many clients who followed what they considered to be professional and ethical advice.    Activity Elements of the paragraphs will be outlined at the beginning and end of each section in [ ]. Introduction The global financial crisis of 2007 (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis so severe that is was labelled as the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Yet many economists argue that the problem could have been avoided, if ideologues supporting the economics models of the time weren't so vocal, influential and inconsiderate of others' viewpoints and concerns.&nbsp;[contention-start]As the negative consequences of the GFC unfolded in Australia, key influencers demanded that lessons be learned so as to minimise the risk of such events occurring in the future. Key critics are concerned that, despite calls from key regulatory agencies for rapid and widespread change to offset the risk of a future financial crisis, little has changed leaving the Australian finance sector vulnerable to future economic collapse.

In order to manipulate expressions containing brackets it is necessary to remove them first. This module discusses how to remove brackets.      The Distributive Law In what follow we will write \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)\\) which means \\(a\\times\\left(b+c\\right)\\). That is the \\(a\\) multiplies the bracket. We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\). The distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In words, the \\(a\\) outside the bracket multiplies everything inside the bracket. For example, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\left(3+5\\right) &amp; =2\\times3+2\\times5. \\end{align*}\\] Removing the brackets is called expansion.  Examples  Expand \\(3\\left(x+2\\right)\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =3\\times x+3\\times2\\\\ &amp; =3x+6. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(-5\\left(m+4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -5\\left(m+4\\right) &amp; =\\left(-5\\right)\\times m+\\left(-5\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-5m-20. \\end{align*}\\] Usually we omit the first step shown above and expand directly as shown in the following examples. Expand \\(-2\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =-2p+14. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(e\\left(e+2\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} e\\left(e+2\\right) &amp; =e^{2}+2e. \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(-\\left(4p-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -\\left(4p-3\\right) &amp; =-4p+3. \\end{align*}\\] Expand and simplify \\(4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right) &amp; =4x-12+2x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x-10. \\end{align*}\\] Expand and simplify \\(6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right) &amp; =12k^{2}+18k-3k^{2}+9k\\\\ &amp; =9k^{2}+27k. \\end{align*}\\] Now do some practice. See Exercise \\(1\\).     Binomial Products A binomial product is something like \\(\\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right).\\) It is the product of two binomial terms.1 A binomial term is an expression involving two terms. Examples are: \\(a+3\\), \\(1+c,\\) \\(a+b,\\) and \\(\\left(3x+2y\\right)\\).  To expand the two brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. Then simplify if possible. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right) &amp; =m\\left(m+3\\right)+2\\left(m+3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+3m+2m+6\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+5m+6. \\end{align*}\\] Symbolically we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)\\left(c+d\\right) &amp; =ac+ad+bc+bd. \\end{align*}\\]  Two Important Cases Special cases arise when the binomial terms are the same. That is \\(\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)=\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)=\\left(a-b\\right)^{2}\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+ab+ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-ab-ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These occur often in mathematics and you should commit them to memory.   Examples  Expand \\(\\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right) &amp; =2fg+\\left(2f\\right)\\left(5h\\right)+3g+15h\\\\ &amp; =2fg+10fh+3g+15h. \\end{align*}\\] In this case not further simplification is possible. Expand \\(\\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =p^{2}-7p-2p+14\\\\ &amp; =p^{2}-9p+14 \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(\\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right) &amp; =2w^{2}-8w+3w-12\\\\ &amp; =2w^{2}-5w-12 \\end{align*}\\] Expand \\(\\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-12rs-12sr+9s^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] This can be done faster if you remember eqn (2) above: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r\\right)^{2}-2\\left(4r\\right)\\left(3s\\right)+\\left(-3s\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] For some practice, please try out Exercise 2.

The writer makes a case for a particular contention by presenting key arguments, claims and supporting evidence. The writer will use language and may use assumptions to persuade you to believe their arguments. When analysing the argument, you will examine the text and critically assess the logic of the writer's position and the quality of their arguments. This page will take you through the key steps of analysing an argument. What do we need to look for when we start reading the literature for an assignment? What is the argument? An argument is the position or claim that the writer is putting forward. An argument can be recognised via language, evidence, and text comparisons. An argument will assume an audience's awareness of the topic and also consider their assumptions, prior knowledge and interest. Identifying the bias in writing Bias is evident when an argument is presented in a way that intentionally favours one side or other. The author wants to persuade or influence the audience (reader or listener). Bias can be recognised via language, sentence structure, evidence used (including quality of evidence) for supporting claims, lack of evidence for refuting claims, repetition of themes and language, being subjective. How does the author influence the audience? Selected vocabulary (which could include colloquial or jargon words), language techniques and sentence construction are used to appeal to a particular audience. Arguments are carefully considered to ensure they are convincing to the target audience. Critically analyse: Identify claims, evidence, assumptions  Critical analysis starts with these questions: What is\/are the overall claim\/s of the author? Is the claim backed up by credible evidence? Is the claim based on assumptions?  What is the evidence? Evidence includes information or data from elsewhere to support the claims the writer makes, or refute the claims made by others. Evidence can be judged for quality by the credibility of their origins. Evidence needs to come from a source that has authority and is up-to-date and objective. Is the evidence credible? Credible evidence comes from sources that readers can believe are factual and valid, based on the sources: To understand if evidence is credible, the key things to look for are:  Author (who does the author work for\/write for? What other publications have they been involved in? What is their area and level of expertise in the topic?) date (is the information current, given the topic?) source (is the publication source well known or respected in the industry? Peer reviewed? Relevant to the topic?) ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1584 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: When you \"Analyse an Argument\" you evaluate someone else's argument.

When getting started, remember that the best option is the one which suits the whole group. Keep in mind that not everyone has used these tools before, so you might need to assist some group members in setting up collaboration spaces and documents, or you might need to ask them to help you - that's all part of group work! You and your group members can also contact RMIT's IT Service and Support Centre to help you with some of these tools. Read the information below to learn more about the tools available and how they can make group collaboration more effective. [tabs type=\"tabs\"] [tab title=\"Microsoft 365\" active=\"true\"] You are probably familiar with Microsoft Word, a word processing application, which is part of the Microsoft Office Suite. Other Microsoft applications include Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, and SharePoint. All of these applications, and more, have been packaged together to create Microsoft 365, to which RMIT students have free access and live tech support.  If you haven't already set up your student Microsoft account, you can find out how to access your free account on the Software and Apps page.  RMIT students using Microsoft 365 can also receive technical support by contacting the IT Support Centre. [\/tab] [tab title=\"Office applications\"] Online applications like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint allow you and your group members to co-author documents and edit in real time. Rather than emailing updates back and forth to each other, which is a slow process, you and your group members can work simultaneously on the same document and leave comments for later changes. Learn more about using Office applications to collaborate on your work:  Co-author in Microsoft Office Collaborate on Word documents Work together on PowerPoint presentations  [\/tab] [tab title=\"OneDrive\"] OneDrive gives you 1TB (that's a lot!) of personal cloud storage space. You can store photos, videos, and documents on the cloud without using up local space on your computer. You can make your documents in OneDrive private or share access with other people.

[\/tab] [tab title=\"SharePoint\"] SharePoint is a collaborative platform where online teams can keep shared work. It has many similarities to OneDrive, but the main difference is that OneDrive is for personal files, and nothing is shared unless you choose to share it. On the other hand, SharePoint folders are collaborative and everything is shared, unless you choose to make it private. SharePoint is good for long group work projects, or multiple group work projects, as it allows you to keep things well organised within your group.

However, please be aware that specialised tech support is not available for these tools through RMIT. Google Drive is a cloud storage platform which offers 15GB of free storage for users with a Google account. From Google Drive you can create, store, and share documents made using the G Suite of Office applications, including Google Docs and Google Slides.  Dropbox is another cloud storage platform which allows users to create, store, and share both Microsoft Office documents and G Suite documents. Their basic plan, which is free, offers 2GB of space.

Usually supported by the claims. An author's contention is the main claim they're trying to prove throughout their article.  Placing their contention at the beginning is the most direct method, and has the effect of positioning the reader to the author's beliefs from the outset.   A contention placed at the end of an article can have the effect of seeming like a valid, logical conclusion to a well-thought through discussion.   The contention can also be repeated throughout the article. The author may have chosen to present it in this way in order to continue reiterating their main point in the audience's minds, aligning them to their views.  Case study: The Australian Banking Sector  Introduction The global financial crisis of 2007 (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis so severe that is was labelled as the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Yet many economists argue that the problem could have been avoided, if ideologues supporting the economics models of the time weren't so vocal, influential and inconsiderate of others' viewpoints and concerns. As the negative consequences of the GFC unfolded in Australia, key influencers demanded that lessons be learned so as to minimise the risk of such events occurring in the future. Key critics are concerned that, despite calls from key regulatory agencies for rapid and widespread change to offset the risk of a future financial crisis, little has changed leaving the Australian finance sector vulnerable to future economic collapse.

The need for change The global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007 rocked the global banking and financial sectors however, the lessons learned from the GFC have not heeded by the Australian Banking Sector. The 2007 GFG witnessed the loss of trillions of dollars from banking and finance sectors worldwide resulting in the collapse of banks, economies and devastating the personal lives of millions (Montague et. al. 2016). We have all been affected by this collapse yet, despite this state of destruction, with over 70 inquiries or reviews into related aspects of the Australian financial services industry since 2007, little has changed to ensure better protection for the Australian financial section (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) (www.apra.gov.au). Australia has a limited number of large banks on a comparative global scale but all are well capitalised and underpinned by a robust retail base, developed capabilities in regard to wealth management and fully serviced activities in trade finance and commercial and corporate advisory infrastructure impacting on the South East Asian Region (Austrade, 2011).

Supports the claims and arguments and can include support for the claim, such as examples, statistics, quotes etc. In academic writing, evidence used from other sources must be referenced. Evidence is being presented in support of the claim and argument. All evidence provides some level of relevance. Always analyse the quality of each piece of evidence being presented to you as the reader. You need to be able to determine the quality of evidence as being strong or weak. Also consider whether the writer adequately presents evidence that contradicts their argument. This can indicate a writer that is present a balanced perspective.  Strong evidence: Sufficient evidence, high quality evidence. Weak evidence: Insufficient evidence, poor quality evidence.  A contention needs to be supported by relevant, reliable, credible, sufficient and current evidence. If there is no evidence, it isn't an argument - it is only an opinion, a description, or an explanation. Question the evidence the author has used.  Does the evidence provided support the argument? How credible (trustworthy) is the evidence? Has enough evidence been presented? Does it come from different sources? Are there any missing links between the evidence and the author's contention? Is the evidence current? Is there other evidence available that might challenge the evidence used?   Take notice of linking words and phrases which demonstrate cause\/reason, effect\/results, to help identify the evidence used to support the argument. Finding the evidence.

[\/tab] [tab title=\"Assumption\"] Assumption: Information the writer believes the readers will already know. Assumptions are embedded in the arguments. They are seldom explicit and therefore can be difficult to identify. Sometimes we assume the answer or reason we have given is &lsquo;obvious' or &lsquo;common sense'. This is because we believe (often incorrectly) that other people think and feel the same as we do. Assumptions come from our personal beliefs and values; they may be justified, or not. Often assumptions are also unstated or &lsquo;hidden' because the writer feels it is unnecessary to explain. Weak or false arguments are based on incorrect assumptions and are not well-supported by credible evidence.

[\/tab] [tab title=\"Language\"] Language: The deliberate choice of words to influence or to trigger a response. This refers to a range of different persuasive language techniques used by writers in their texts to trigger a particular effect on the reader. Persuasive language includes: Ridicule, attacks: The writer attacks an opponent or idea. This is an assertion of the writer's viewpoint, and is used to prove the writers point by using attacking and putting down persuasion techniques against the opponent or idea. These methods are often effective in placing the reader in a position of agreement with the writer. Emotional language: (key emotional words are emphasised): Words used to deliberately create an emotional impact or response from the audience. The effect of using emotive language as a persuasive technique is to appeal to people's emotions and trigger an emotional response. Hyperbole: A hyperbole is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point for emphasis. They are not meant to be taken literally. By using a hyperbole, a story can quickly become interesting or sound more convincing. Hyperboles are comparisons, but are exaggerated and often ridiculous.

While most discussion posts follow the same general rules, there are some differences in terms of the content you need to cover and the structure you need to follow.\r\n\r\nWriting a general discussion post, in which you share your knowledge and personal experience informally, is different to a task-based discussion post which will be assessed and marked by your tutor. The following information will help you understand the differences between these two types of discussion board posts.\r\n\r\nWriting a general discussion post\r\nFollowing some simple tips can help you carry out some meaningful discussions online. For a general discussion post:\r\n\r\n \tPost early and before you post, make sure you read all other posts to avoid repeating what others have already said.\r\n \tWrite clearly and concisely; because you can't rely on eye contact and body language, it's better to make sure you write clearly so that everyone can understand what you mean.\r\n \tRefer to points others have made in their posts when you respond. This will help them understand how your ideas relate to the discussion.\r\n \tExplain yourself clearly by elaborating on your answers or by sharing personal experiences and examples.\r\n \tCheck your grammar and punctuation and avoid using slang or abbreviations.\r\n \tAlways be respectful and remember that what you write may come across differently when it's read by others.\r\n\r\nWriting a task-based discussion post\r\nFollowing some simple tips can help you achieve higher marks on your discussion board tasks and assignments. For a task-based discussion post:\r\n\r\n \tRead the task instructions carefully.\r\n \tMake sure you follow the required number of words, and the number of sources you need to have.\r\n \tCheck out the referencing requirements, for example the number of references to include in your post, and follow the referencing guidelines in your posts.\r\n \tRead the rubrics to understand what you are being marked on.\r\n \tEdit and proofread before you submit your post.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteracting on a discussion board\r\nWhen interacting on discussion boards, you will often be required to agree or disagree with something a classmate has written. Providing feedback, including constructive criticism, on classmates' work can be tricky. The tips below can help you write polite and effective feedback.\r\n\r\nHow to agree\/disagree with a classmate's post\r\nWhen disagreeing with what has been written in a post, be mindful of your tone. Don't just disagree, use evidence to support your opinion, so your classmate can better understand your point of view.\r\n\r\nWhen agreeing, make sure to write more than 'I agree'. Refer to a specific point and explain why you agree. Giving examples and contributing to the conversation will make the discussion richer.\r\n\r\nRemember that you are in an academic forum, which means it's best to use academic language and avoid jokes or sarcasm.\r\n\r\nProviding and responding to peer feedback\r\nBeing able to give and receive feedback in an open and respectful way is important for your studies and your future career. When responding to peer feedback, it is best to:\r\n\r\n \tthank the person\r\n \tacknowledge the time they have spent\r\n \tshow that you have read it carefully by referring to something they have commented on.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nThanks for taking the time to give me feedback on my report, Lisa. You've given me some things to think about, especially your suggestions about the phrasing of the second paragraph.

Write clearly and concisely; because you can't rely on eye contact and body language, it's better to make sure you write clearly so that everyone can understand what you mean. Refer to points others have made in their posts when you respond. This will help them understand how your ideas relate to the discussion. Explain yourself clearly by elaborating on your answers or by sharing personal experiences and examples. Check your grammar and punctuation and avoid using slang or abbreviations. Always be respectful and remember that what you write may come across differently when it's read by others.   Writing a task-based discussion post Following some simple tips can help you achieve higher marks on your discussion board tasks and assignments. For a task-based discussion post:  Read the task instructions carefully. Make sure you follow the required number of words, and the number of sources you need to have. Check out the referencing requirements, for example the number of references to include in your post, and follow the referencing guidelines in your posts. Read the rubrics to understand what you are being marked on. Edit and proofread before you submit your post.

Lewis Structures of Molecular Compounds Draw the Lewis structure of \\(\\ce{SO}_{2}\\)  Step 1 - Count the total number of valence shell electrons of all the atoms involved in the molecule Sulphur dioxide has two sulphur atoms and one oxygen atom.

The atom that can form most bonds is considered as the central atom. If two different atoms can form the same number of bonds, then the least electronegative atom should be the central atom. Among sulphur and oxygen, sulphur is the least electronegative atom. Step 3 - Draw the bonds connected to the central atom.  Step 4 - Add the lone pairs of electrons to the atoms connected to the central atom. Calculate the remaining valence electrons after drawing bonds. Four valence electrons are used for two bonds. Remaining valence electrons \\(=18-4=14\\). These fourteen valence electrons can be distributed among atoms connected to the central atom as lone pairs to complete the octet.  Step 5 - Assign lone pairs of electrons to the central atom if any valence electrons remain. \\(14-12=2\\) To assign lone pairs to the connected atoms, we have used twelve electrons. Therefore, we have two electrons remaining, which can be allocated to the central atom as a lone pair.  Step 6 - If the central atom still lacks the octet, create multiple bonds with connected atoms using lone pairs of electrons.   Since sulphur has not acquired the octet, create a double bond with one of the oxygens using a lone pair. With the double bond, all three atoms have acquired an octet. Finally, calculate the formal charges for each atom. Formal charges should be closer to zero for each atom. Use the following formula to calculate the formal charges. Formal charge \\(=\\) Valence electrons of the atom \\(-\\) Lone pairs of electrons \\(-\\) Bonding electrons  For \\(\\ce{S}\\), formal charge \\(=6-2-3=+1\\) For single-bonded \\(\\ce{O}\\), formal charge \\(=6-6-1=-1\\) For double-bonded \\(\\ce{O}\\), formal charge \\(=6-4-2=0\\)   Lewis Structures of Polyatomic Ions  Polyatomic Anions Draw the Lewis structure of \\(\\ce{CO}_{3}^{2-}\\) (carbonate ion) Step 1 - Count the total number of valence shell electrons of all the atoms involved in the molecule, including the charge of the ion.

Among carbon and oxygen, carbon can form many bonds. Step 3 - Draw the bonds connected to the central atom.  Step 4 - Add the lone pairs of electrons to the atoms connected to the central atom. Calculate the remaing valence electrons after drawing bonds. Six valence electrons are given for three bonds. Remaining valence electrons \\(=24-6=18\\). These eighteen valence electrons can be distributed among atoms connected to the central atom as lone pairs to complete the octet.  Step 5 - Assign lone pairs of electrons to the central atom if any valence electrons remain. Not applicable since we have used all the valence electrons. Step 6 - If the central atom still lacks the octet, create multiple bonds with connected atoms using lone pairs of electrons. The central atom only has six electrons, therefore create a double bond with one of the oxygen atoms using lone pairs of electrons.  Calculate the formal charges and allocate two negative charges.

Step 3 - Draw the bonds connected to the central atom.  Step 4 - Add the lone pairs of electrons to the atoms connected to the central atom. Calculate the remaining valence electrons after drawing bonds. Eight valence electrons are given for four bonds. Remaining valence electrons \\(=8-8=0\\). Since all the valence electrons have been used no need for step 4. Step 5 - Assign lone pairs of electrons to the central atom if any valence electrons remain. Not applicable since all the valence electrons have been used. Step 6 - If the central atom still lacks the octet, create multiple bonds with connected atoms using lone pairs of electrons. Since the central atom already acquired the octet, this step is not required. Calculate the formal charges and assign the positive charge.

In a covalent bond, the difference between the electronegativity of participating atoms is smaller than the ionic bonds. Covalent bonds are usually formed between elements within the \\(p\\) block. Atoms held together by covalent bonds give rise to molecular compounds. Examples: \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), \\(\\ce{HF}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)  Atoms involved in a covalent bond acquire the octet in their valence shell by sharing electrons between atoms. Generally, the number of covalent bonds an atom forms depends on how many electrons an atom requires to achieve an octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms four covalent bonds as \\(\\ce{C}\\) \\(\\left(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{2}\\right)\\) needs four more electrons to acquire an octet in their valence shell. A few more examples are listed in the following table.         Element Electron configuration Electrons required to fill the octet Number of covalent bonds     \\(\\ce{N}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{3}\\) \\(3\\) \\(3\\)   \\(\\ce{O}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4}\\) \\(2\\) \\(2\\)   \\(\\ce{F}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{5}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\)   \\(\\ce{H}\\) \\(1s^{1}\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\)    However, the number of covalent bonds formed by an atom is not always guided by the octet rule. For instance, \\(\\ce{S}\\) can form four or six covalent bonds such as \\(\\ce{SF}_{4}\\) and \\(\\ce{SF}_{6}\\). Some of the other exceptions to the octet rule are \\(\\ce{BF}_{3}\\), \\(\\ce{PCl}_{5}\\) and some of the \\(p\\) block elements in period four as they have empty \\(d\\) orbitals.  Multiple covalent bonds Multiple covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when they share more than one pair of electrons to acquire valence shell octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{CO}_{2}\\): \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms two covalent bonds (2 pairs of electrons or 4 electrons) with each oxygen atom involved.  Ethyne is another example where carbon forms multiple bonds. In this case, one carbon atom forms a triple bond (6 electrons or 3 electron pairs) with another carbon atom to complete the octet.  Single bonds: when two electrons are shared between two atoms. Double bonds: when four electrons are shared between two atoms. Triple bonds: when six electrons are shared between two atoms.   Coordinate covalent bonds When the shared electrons between two atoms are donated only by one atom, the resulting bond is known as a coordinate covalent bond. In a typical covalent bond, both atoms donate electrons to the bond. In contrast, in a coordinate covalent bond, an atom with a filled orbital shares its two electrons with an empty orbital of another atom.  Examples: \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{O}^{+}\\) ion and \\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\) ion   Polar Covalent Bonds Uneven sharing of two electrons creates a single covalent bond, but with a significant ionic component due to the difference in electronegativity, resulting in a distorted polarised molecular electron cloud. For instance, \\(\\ce{HF}\\): \\(\\ce{H}\\)'s EN - EN \\(=\\) electronegativity: ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons - is 2.20. \\(\\ce{F}\\)'s EN is 3.98. The difference of EN \\(=3.98-2.2=1.78\\). Electrons are more strongly attracted to the more electronegative atom, in this case to \\(\\ce{F}\\). So, the electron-rich \\(\\ce{F}\\) has a partial negative charge (designated as \\(\\delta-\\) ), while electron-poor \\(\\ce{H}\\) has a partial positive charge \\(\\left(\\delta+\\right)\\), creating a dipole moment \\(\\left(\\mu\\right)\\). These types of bonds are known as polar covalent bonds. The difference between the electronegativity of participating atoms in a bond indicates whether the bond is ionic, covalent or polar covalent.    Electronegativity difference Type of bond Examples     \\(\\geqslant2.0\\) Ionic \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), \\(\\ce{CsF}\\)   \\(0.5-1.9\\) Polar covalent \\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)   \\(0-0.4\\) Covalent \\(\\ce{CH}_{4}\\), \\(\\ce{O}_{2}\\)      The Polarity of Molecules The net polarity of a molecule depends on the polarity of the individual bonds, the contribution from lone pairs, and the molecule's shape. In a polar molecule, electrons are more strongly attracted to one part of the molecule. For example, in the water molecule, due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom, electrons are strongly attracted towards the oxygen atom creating the net polarity point between two \\(\\ce{O}-\\ce{H}\\) bonds.  In some cases, although the individual covalent bonds are polar, overall the molecule becomes non-polar due to the shape of the molecule. For instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has polar \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds. However, due to the linear symmetrical shape of the molecule, polar bonds (dipoles) cancel each other, creating a zero net polarity.    Naming Binary Molecular Compounds   The name of the less electronegative atom is written first, followed by the more electronegative atom. Therefore, metals come before nonmetals, and nonmetals located on the left side of the periodic table are written before nonmetals located on the right side.   The name of the more electronegative atom should end with the suffix -ide as used for anions.   Depending on the number of atoms of each element involved in the compound, prefixes such as di, tri, tetra, penta etc. may apply. For instance, compound \\(\\ce{CCl}_{4}\\) is named as \"Carbon tetrachloride\".   Examples    Molecular formula Name of the compound     \\(\\ce{CO}\\) Carbon monoxide   \\(\\ce{CO}_{2}\\) Carbon dioxide   \\(\\ce{BBr}_{3}\\) Boron tribromide   \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\ce{O}_{5}\\) Dinitrogen pentoxide      Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR theory) VSEPR theory states that the shape of a molecule is determined by the number of electron clouds around the central atom. Lone pairs and bonded valence electrons are considered electron clouds. Due to the repulsion forces between electron clouds, they attempt to stay as far as possible. For instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has two electron clouds (two \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds) around the central atom \\(\\ce{C}\\). As a result of repulsion forces between these two electron clouds, the molecule is arranged into linear geometry with a bond angle of \\(180^{\\circ}\\). Multiple bonds such as double and triple bonds are considered one electron cloud. Steps to determine the shape of a molecule using VSEPR theory:  Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule and identify the central atom. For instance, in an ammonia molecule (\\(\\ce{NH}_{3})\\), the central atom is \\(\\ce{N}\\) as it forms most bonds.    Sum up the number of bonds and lone pairs connected to the central atom to get the total number of electron clouds around the central atom. Example: In the ammonia molecule, the central atom \\(\\ce{N}\\) has three bonds with each \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom and one lone pair. Therefore there are four electron clouds (three bonds and one lone pair) around the central atom.    Anticipate the shape of the molecule based on the number of electron clouds around the central atom. Example: Four electron clouds around \\(\\ce{N}\\) arrange in such a way that each cloud stays as far as possible from the others to minimise the repulsion forces between them. Generally, when there are four electron clouds around the central atom, these are arranged to result in a tetrahedral shape. A tetrahedron is composed of four equilateral triangles. The central atom is located in the centre and electron clouds are located towards the corners of the tetrahedron. Molecules with a tetrahedral shape have a bond angle of \\(109^{\\circ}\\). Due to the presence of a lone pair on one corner of the tetrahedron, the overall shape of ammonia becomes pyramidal rather than tetrahedral with a bond angle of \\(107^{\\circ}\\).            Number of bonds Number of lone pairs Total number of electron clouds Shape Example     2 0 2 Linear    3 0 3 Trigonal planar    2 1 3 Angular\/bent    4 0 4 Tetrahedal    3 1 4 Pyramid    2 2 4 Angular\/bent     When more than one central atom is present in the molecule, predict the molecular geometry of each central atom and then combine the results. For instance, \\(\\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{4}\\) has two central \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms. Each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom is attached to three electron clouds. This means each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom has a trigonal planar geometry. In this case, the whole molecule is also planar, as the bond angles \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{H}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{C}\\) are \\(120^{\\circ}\\) each.

Likewise, in chemistry, chemists consider: \\[ 1\\textrm{mole}=6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{objects} \\] The objects can be anything such as houses, sand, eggs, or oranges. However, in chemistry, objects are mainly atoms, ions or molecules. One mole of anything contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) objects. For instance, one mole of eggs contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) eggs, one mole of carbon contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) carbon atoms, one mole of carbon dioxide contains \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) carbon dioxide molecules. The symbol of moles is \"mol\".  Thus, three moles of particles is three times \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\)particles \\(\\left(3\\times6.022\\times10^{23}\\right)\\), and ten moles of particles is ten times \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\)particles \\(\\left(10\\times6.022\\times10^{23}\\right)\\). If we had \\(3.011\\times10^{24}\\) atoms of gold \\(\\left(\\ce{Au}\\right)\\), the number of mole, of gold would be: Moles of \\(\\ce{Au}=\\frac{3.011\\times10^{24}\\textrm{atoms}}{6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{atoms mole}^{-1}}=5.000\\textrm{mol}\\)   Avogadro's Number (N) Avogadro's number is the term used for \\(6.022\\times10^{23}\\) objects. \\[ N_{A}=6.022\\times10^{23}\\textrm{mol}^{-1} \\] Avogadro's number is the link between the number of atoms (or molecule or ions) of a material and the number of moles of material.   Molar Mass (\\(M\\)) Atomic mass is the average mass of an atom of an element measured in atomic mass units (amu). One atomic mass unit is equal to \\(1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}\\), which is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the mass of a \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atom. \\[ 1\\textrm{amu}=1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}=\\frac{1}{12}\\times\\textrm{mass of }^{12}\\ce{C}\\textrm{ atom} \\] Thus, the mass of one \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atom is \\[ 1.66054\\times10^{-24}\\textrm{g}\\times12=1.99265\\times10^{-23}\\textrm{g} \\] Then the mass of a mole of \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) atoms will be \\[ 1.99265\\times10^{-23}\\textrm{g}\\times6.02214\\times10^{23}\\textrm{mol}^{-1}=12.0000\\textrm{gmol}^{-1} \\] Molar mass is the mass of one mole of the substance. For instance, the molar mass of \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\) is \\(12.0000\\textrm{g}\\). However, the mass of one mole of apples can be expected to be higher than the molar mass of \\(^{12}\\ce{C}\\). Therefore, depending on the mass of individual objects, molar mass can vary, although the number of objects in a mole is fixed. SI units of molar mass are kg mol. However, in practice, g mol is frequently used as the unit. The molar mass of an atom and the atomic mass of an atom have the same numerical values, but units are different. For instance, the atomic mass of \\(\\ce{Mg}\\) is \\(24.31\\textrm{amu}\\): therefore, one mole of \\(\\ce{Mg}\\) weighs \\(24.31\\textrm{g}\\). To calculate the molar mass of a compound or molecule, get the atomic mass of each atom from the periodic table, multiply it by the number of each type of atom and then total the answers obtained for each type of atom. For example: Molar mass of \\(\\ce{Na}_{2}\\ce{CO}_{3}\\). Atomic mass of \\(\\ce{O}\\), \\(\\ce{C}\\) and \\(\\ce{Na}\\) can be obtained from the periodic table in units of gram. \\(\\ce{O}=16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\), \\(\\ce{C}=12.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\), \\(\\ce{Na}=23.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\). Sodium carbonate contains two \\(\\ce{Na}\\) atoms, one \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom and three \\(\\ce{O}\\) atoms. \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{The molar mass} &amp; =\\textrm{Sum of masses of atoms in a mole of the chemical species}\\\\ = &amp; \\left(2\\times23.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\right)+12.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}+\\left(3\\times16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\right)\\\\ = &amp; 106\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Definition of molar mass creates an important relationship between the amount of substance (moles) and the mass of the substance (m): \\[ M=\\frac{m}{n} \\] Where, \\(M=\\) Molar mass \\(\\left(\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\right)\\) \\(m=\\)mass of the substance \\(\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\) \\(n=\\)Number of Moles \\(\\left(\\textrm{mol}\\right)\\) Example: Calculate the amount of silver present in \\(50.00\\textrm{g}\\) of silver. Molar mass of \\(\\ce{Ag}\\) is \\(107.87\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\). Question states to calculate the amount of silver, which means the number of moles of silver. The molar mass of silver and the mass of silver are given in the question. Therefore, you can use \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\) equation to find the number of moles \\(\\left(n\\right)\\). First, rearrange the equation to make \\(n\\) the subject and then substitute given values for \\(M\\) and \\(m\\). Make sure you write the units as well. \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{50.00\\textrm{g}}{107.87\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.4635\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]   The Mole and chemical formulas As we know, chemical formulas indicate the number of atoms of each element present in the compound. For instance, \\(\\ce{Na}_{2}\\ce{CO}_{3}\\): one molecule of sodium carbonate contains two atoms of sodium, one atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen. Similarly, chemical formulas can also indicate the number of moles of atoms of each type of element present in one mole of the compound. Let's take the same example \\(\\ce{Na}_{2}\\ce{CO}_{3}\\) again; this time the chemical formula of sodium carbonate indicates that 2 moles of sodium, one mole of carbon and three moles of oxygen are present in one mole of sodium carbonate.

Stoichiometric coefficient The stoichiometric coefficient is the number written immediately before the atoms, ions and molecules in a balanced chemical equation. These numbers indicate the ratio of any reactant or product that reacts or forms in a reaction. Example: Let's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia. The balanced chemical equation can be written as follows: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\] Three, one and two are written in front of \\(\\ce{H},\\ce{N},\\ce{NH}_{3}\\), respectively, these are considered as stoichiometric coefficients. Stoichiometric coefficients in this reaction show that three molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of nitrogen gas to form two ammonia molecules. When there is no coefficient before an atom, ion or molecule, we interpret it as one. For instance, the coefficient of molecular nitrogen in this reaction is one.   The molar ratio and chemical equations The stoichiometric coefficients in a balanced chemical equation can also be interpreted on the molar scale. Let's consider the same example again: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\] Based on the molar scale, we can say that three moles of hydrogen gas react with one mole of nitrogen gas to form two moles of ammonia gas. Molar scale interpretation relates to the quantities of substances involved in the reaction. Therefore, if we know the amount of one substance involved in the reaction, we can use the molar ratio to determine the amounts of others involved in the reaction.  Moles calculations Worked Example 1: How many moles of ammonia gas can be produced from \\(0.18\\textrm{mol}\\) of hydrogen gas? \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\] We are asked to calculate the amount of ammonia and are given the moles of hydrogen and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. We need to find out the molar ratio of hydrogen and ammonia to calculate the amount of ammonia. From the stoichiometric coefficients, we know that three moles of hydrogen produce two moles of ammonia. Therefore, the molar ratio between hydrogen gas to ammonia gas is \\(3:2\\). Thus, if we use \\(0.18\\textrm{mol}\\) of hydrogen gas, we can produce the following amount of ammonia gas: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{NH}_{3}}{3\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}} &amp; \\times0.18\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}=0.12\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\]   Mass calculations Worked Example 2: The burning of methane gas \\(\\left(\\ce{CH}_{4}\\right)\\) in excess oxygen produces carbon dioxide gas and water vapour. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is as follows: \\[ \\ce{CH}_{4}\\left(g\\right)+2\\ce{O}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow\\ce{CO}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+2\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(g\\right) \\] How many moles of water vapour can be obtained by the complete burning of \\(3.20\\textrm{g}\\) of methane gas? The molar mass of methane is \\(16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\). We are asked to calculate the number of moles of water vapour and are given the mass of methane and the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. To find the moles of water vapour, first, we need to find out the moles of methane. As the quantity of methane is given in grams, we need to convert it to moles using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\)1 \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{3.20\\textrm{g}}{16.0\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.200\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] To relate the amount of methane to the amount of water vapour, we need to know the molar ratio of the two. From the balanced chemical equation, we know one mole of methane produces two moles of water vapour. Therefore, \\(0.200\\textrm{mol}\\) of methane can produce the following amount of water vapour: \\[ \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{CH}_{4}}\\times0.200\\textrm{mol}\\ce{CH}_{4}=0.400\\textrm{mol} \\]    Limiting reagents and yields  Limiting and excess reagents Let's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia gas again: \\[ 3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(g\\right) \\] Based on stoichiometry, we know that if we mix three moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) with one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\), we can obtain two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). In other words, \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) reacts with \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) in a molar ratio of \\(3:1\\). If we mix three moles of hydrogen gas and two moles of nitrogen gas, what will happen? Similarly, three moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) will react with one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) and produce two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). However, the entire quantity of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) will be used before the \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we start with the exact amount of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) required for the reaction. The product mixture will contain one unreacted mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we only required one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) for the reaction. If we had more \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), we could have produced more \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) as we already have excess \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\). Therefore, in this reaction, we call \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) the limiting reagent since it limits the production of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). Hence, the limiting reagent is the reactant that runs out first, limiting the formation of products. Nitrogen gas is called the excess reagent because we have a greater amount than required for the reaction. Worked Example: Phosphoric acid is produced by treating the phosphate rock, which contains calcium phosphate, with sulphuric acid, as follows: \\[ \\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}+3\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\rightarrow3\\ce{CaSO}_{4}+2\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4} \\] A chemist in a fertiliser production plant mixed \\(144.5\\textrm{g}\\) of calcium phosphate with \\(160.5\\textrm{g}\\) of sulphuric acid. What is the maximum mass of phosphoric acid that can be formed? The molar masses are given below.    Molecule Molar mass (g\/mol)     \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) \\(310.2\\)   \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) \\(98.1\\)   \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) \\(97.99\\)    We are given the mass of reactants and are asked to determine the mass of one of the products. Step 1 - Identify the limiting reagent in this reaction. For that, find the number of moles of each reactant using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\). Number of moles of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{144.5\\textrm{g}}{310.2\\textrm{ g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.4658\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Number of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{160.5\\textrm{g}}{98.1\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =1.64\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Then, compare the calculated moles with the molar ratio of two reactants. According to the balanced chemical equation, calcium phosphate reacts with sulphuric acid in a \\(1:3\\) molar ratio. Therefore, \\(0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) reacts with the following number of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}}\\times0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2} &amp; =1.397\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] We have \\(1.64\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) , but we only need \\(1.397\\textrm{mol}\\) for the reaction. This means we have excess \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\) acid. Therefore, the limiting reagent is \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\). The quantity of limiting reagent can determine the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid formed. Step 2 - Use the molar ratio between \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid to calculate the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid formed. We know one mole of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) forms two moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid from the balanced chemical equation. Therefore, the number of moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid forms from \\(0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\) is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2\\textrm{mol}\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}}{1\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2}}\\times0.4658\\textrm{mol}\\ce{Ca}_{3}\\left(\\ce{PO}_{4}\\right)_{2} &amp; =0.9316\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Now, find the mass of \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) using \\(M=\\frac{m}{n}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} M &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\\\ m &amp; =M\\times n\\\\ m &amp; =97.99\\textrm{g}\/\\textrm{mol}\\times0.9316\\textrm{mol}\\\\ m &amp; =91.29\\textrm{g} \\end{align*}\\] Based on the given reaction conditions, maximum mass we can obtain for \\(\\ce{H}_{3}\\ce{PO}_{4}\\) acid is \\(91.29\\textrm{g}\\).   Yields Theoretical yield is the maximum amount of the product that can form under the given reaction conditions. The available amount of limiting reagent determines the maximum amount of the product that can be formed. Theoretical yield can be calculated using the stoichiometric coefficients (or molar ratios) displayed in the balanced chemical equation. We calculate theoretical yield assuming no losses occur during the reaction, and all the reactants convert to products. However, in reality, often losses and inefficiencies occur during chemical reactions. Therefore, the actual amount you isolate and measure from a chemical reaction is less than the theoretically expected amount. The actual yield of a product is the amount of the product you isolate from the chemical reaction. You can not calculate the actual yield. It must be determined experimentally. You need to isolate the product and weigh it to get the actual yield. Percentage yield \\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Actual yield}}{\\textrm{Theoretical yield}}\\times100 \\] Percentage yield indicates the success of the reaction. If the value is closer to the hundred, that means losses are minor, and most reactants have converted to products. 1 Where, M=Molar mass (g\/mol) m=mass of the substance (g) n=Number of Moles (mol)     @import\u00a0url(\"\/learninglab\/sites\/default\/files\/enhanced\/maths.css\");","excerpt":"nodeID: 1554 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Stoichiometry describes the relationship between relative quantities of reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation.

Main components of a chemical equation:  Reactants: The starting materials of the reaction. Reactants are written on the left side of the equation. Products: The materials obtained at the end of the reaction and written on the right side of the equation. An arrow is drawn between the reactants and products pointing towards the products to designate a chemical change. Conditions required for the reaction to occur, for instance, pressure and temperature, are written above the arrow. Physical state of the substances involved: This is written next to the chemical formulas using brackets and abbreviations, as shown next. Solid - (s), Liquid - (l), Gas - (g), Aqueous solution (a substance dissolved in water) - (aq) Coefficient: The numbers written before the chemical formulas to balance the chemical equation. 1  Let's take the photosynthesis reaction that occurs in plants as an example. Photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen in the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll using sunlight, carbon dioxide and water, as illustrated below.  Photosynthesis equation  Writing and balancing chemical equations  Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to produce ammonia gas. Step 1: Write the reactants and products of the chemical equation using correct symbols and formulas.   Reactants are written on the left side and, products are written on the right side. Use the plus sign to separate each reactant or product from others. \\[ \\ce{N}_{2}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{\\qquad}\\ce{NH}_{3} \\]   Place an arrow pointing towards the products between reactants and products. \\[ \\ce{N}_{2}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{\\rightarrow}\\ce{NH}_{3} \\]   Step 2: Balance the chemical equation using suitable coefficients. In a balanced chemical equation, an equal number of atoms of each element involved must be present on both sides (i.e: left and right sides of the equation).   Choose one atom to balance first. Generally, it helps to start with the compound that is composed of the greatest number of atoms. First, focus on the element of that compound which has the highest number of atoms. Thus, choose hydrogen from ammonia to start the balancing. Ammonia contains three hydrogen atoms, while hydrogen on the left side has two atoms. Therefore, to balance the number of hydrogen atoms, six hydrogen atoms will be required for each side as six is the lowest possible number that both two and three can divide evenly. So, place two in front of ammonia and three in front of molecular hydrogen to obtain six hydrogen atoms on both sides. \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\ce{NH}_{3} &amp; \\qquad2\\times3=6\\\\ 3\\ce{H}_{2} &amp; \\qquad3\\times2=6\\\\ \\ce{N}_{2}+3\\ce{H}_{2} &amp; \\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3} \\end{align*}\\]   Next, balance the rest of the atoms in the selected compound. In this example, the next atom will be nitrogen. The right side has two nitrogen atoms and the left side also has two nitrogen atoms. Therefore, nitrogen is already balanced.   Balance the remaining elements in the equation. As the selected equation only contains two types of atoms, there are no more atoms left to be balanced. Otherwise, balance the remaining atoms.   Step 3: Do a final check to ensure all types of atoms in the equation are balanced. At this point, the equation is balanced for both atoms present. Two nitrogen on both sides and six hydrogens on both sides. \\[ \\ce{N}_{2}+3\\ce{H}_{2}\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3} \\] The following table summarises the total number of atoms for each element involved on each side of the equation.

Balance the following chemical equation   \\(\\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{6}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{CO}_{2}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\) Step 1: Write the reactants and products of the chemical equation using correct symbols and formulas. As the chemical equation is already given, this step is not applicable. Step 2: Balance the chemical equation using suitable coefficients.   Choose one atom to balance first. Generally, it helps to start with the compound that is composed of the greatest number of atoms. Focus first on the element of that compound which has the highest number of atoms. Therefore, start with hydrogen. The left side has six hydrogens, and the right side has two hydrogens. Placing three in front of water can give six hydrogen atoms on the right side as well. \\[ \\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{6}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{CO}_{2}+\\ce{3H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\]   Next, balance the carbon atoms. The left side contains two carbon atoms, and the right side contains one carbon atom. Using two as the coefficient for carbon dioxide makes two carbons on each side. \\[ \\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{6}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{2CO}_{2}+\\ce{3H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\]   Finally, balance the oxygen atoms. The left side has three oxygen atoms, and the right side has seven oxygen atoms. Placing three in front of molecular oxygen on the left side gives seven oxygen atoms on each side. \\[ \\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{6}\\ce{O}+\\ce{3O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{2CO}_{2}+\\ce{3H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\]   Step 3: Do a final check to ensure all types of atoms in the equation are balanced.

Write and balance the chemical equation for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of light to water and oxygen gas. Step 1: Write the reactants and products of the chemical equation using correct symbols and formulas. Reactants: Hydrogen peroxide Products: Water and oxygen gas Write the reactants on the left side and products on the right side of the equation. Then place an arrow pointing towards the products. \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2} \\] Step 2: Balance the chemical equation using suitable coefficients. \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2} \\]     Left side Right side     \\(\\ce{H}\\) \\(2\\) \\(2\\)   \\(\\ce{O}\\) \\(2\\) \\(3\\)    According to the above table, hydrogen is already balanced. There are two oxygen atoms on the left side and three oxygen atoms on the right side. The number of oxygen atoms can be balanced by placing \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in front of molecular oxygen. This gives two oxygen atoms on each side: \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\frac{1}{2}\\ce{O}_{2} \\] Step 3: Do a final check to ensure all types of atoms in the equation are balanced. At this point, the equation is balanced for both atoms present. Two hydrogens on both sides and two oxygens on both sides.     Left side Right side     \\(\\ce{H}\\) \\(2\\) \\(2\\)   \\(\\ce{O}\\) \\(2\\) \\(2\\)    Step 4: Check whether the coefficients are in their lowest possible whole numbers. \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\frac{1}{2}\\ce{O}_{2} \\] Except for the coefficient of oxygen on the right side of the equation, the rest have whole number coefficients. To make all coefficients in their smallest whole number, multiply all coefficients by two. \\[ \\ce{2H}_{2}\\ce{O}_{2}\\rightarrow\\ce{2H}_{2}\\ce{O}+\\ce{O}_{2} \\]  1 According to the law of conservation of mass, none of the atoms disappear during the reaction. However, atoms rearrange to form new chemicals. Therefore the total number of atoms of each type must be equal to that on the other side.     @import\u00a0url(\"\/learninglab\/sites\/default\/files\/enhanced\/maths.css\");","excerpt":"nodeID: 1556 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: A chemical reaction is represented by a chemical equation that involves ions, atoms and molecular formulas.

As a result of electron movement, some reactants gain electrons (reduction), and others lose electrons (oxidation). Oxidation is the loss of electron(s) by an atom or ion. Reduction is the gain of electron(s) by an atom or ion. Example 1: Overall reaction: \\[ \\ce{CuO}\\left(s\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu}\\left(s\\right)+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\left(g\\right) \\] Where reduction is \\[ \\ce{Cu}^{2+}+2e\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu} \\] and oxidation is \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\rightarrow2\\ce{H}^{+}+2e \\] Example 2: The following chemical redox reaction: \\[ 2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+\\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag}+\\ce{Zn}^{2+} \\] Can be described by the two so-called electrochemical \"half reactions\": \\(\\ce{Ag}^{+}\\) is reduced \\[ 2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+2e\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag} \\] and \\(\\ce{Zn}\\) is oxidised \\[ \\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow\\ce{Zn}^{2+}+2e \\]   Oxidising agents and reducing agents Oxidising agents can oxidise another reactant by accepting electrons. Therefore, the oxidising agent becomes reduced (by gaining electrons) while oxidising another reactant (causing it to lose electrons). Reducing agents reduce another reactant by offering electrons to the other reactant. Thus, the reducing agent becomes oxidised (by losing electrons) while reducing another reactant (causing it to gain electrons).   Oxidation number In any discussion of redox reactions it is useful to be able to assign an oxidation number to any element in a given compound in order to keep track of the electrons during a reaction. The oxidation number is defined as the apparent electrical charge on the atom according to a set of rules like those following. We need to recognize that: Oxidation leads to a loss of electrons, and an increase in the oxidation number. Reduction is a gain of electrons, and so leads to a decrease in the oxidation number.  Oxidation number rules   The oxidation number of an atom as an element is zero. Examples: \\(\\ce{O}_{2},\\ce{P}_{4},\\ce{Fe},\\ce{Br}_{2}\\) are the elemental forms at room temperature, and they all have an oxidation number of zero.   The oxidation number of oxygen is usually \\(-2\\) (except when bonded to \\(\\ce{F}\\)). Remember that in the element, oxygen \\(\\left(\\ce{O}_{2}\\right)\\) has an oxidation number of zero, whilst in peroxides \\(\\left(\\ce{O}_{2}^{2-}\\right)\\) each oxygen atom has an oxidation number of \\(-1\\).   The oxidation number of a monoatomic ion is equal to the ion's charge. Examples: \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}=\\ce{Na}\\left(+1\\right),\\ce{Cl}^{-}=\\ce{Cl}\\left(-1\\right),\\ce{S}^{2-}=\\ce{S}\\left(-2\\right)\\).   The algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral polyatomic compound is zero; in a polyatomic ion the sum of the oxidation number is equal to the ion's overall charge.   In a combination of elements, the more electronegative element has its characteristic negative oxidation number (for example, \\(\\left(-3\\right)\\) for nitrogen, \\(\\left(-2\\right)\\) for oxygen, \\(\\left(-1\\right)\\) for chlorine), and the more electropositive element has a positive oxidation number (for example, \\(\\left(+1\\right)\\) for hydrogen, \\(\\left(+2\\right)\\) for calcium, \\(\\left(+3\\right)\\) for aluminium).   The oxidation number of hydrogen is usually \\(+1\\) due to its electronegativity being lower than that of the main-group elements to which it is normally bonded. With more electropositive elements, hydrogen has an oxidation number of \\(\\left(-1\\right)\\). For instance, \\(\\ce{NaH}=\\ce{Na}^{+}\\ce{H}^{-}\\).   Example 1: Find the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{4}\\left(aq\\right)\\). Using oxidation number rule \\(4\\), we can write: \\(2\\times\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}+\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}+4\\times\\) the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}=0\\) Rule \\(2\\) states the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(-2\\) and rule \\(6\\) states the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}\\) is \\(+1\\) Lets consider the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) as \"\\(x\\)\" Therefore, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\times\\left(+1\\right)+x+4\\times\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 2+x-8 &amp; =0\\\\ x-6 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =+6 \\end{align*}\\] Example 2: Find the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{I}\\), in \\(\\ce{ICl}_{4}^{-}\\). We use rule \\(4\\) to write: \\(\\left(\\textrm{oxidation number of }\\ce{I}\\right)+\\left(4\\times\\textrm{oxidation number of }\\ce{Cl}\\right)=-1\\) According to rule \\(3,\\) since \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) is more electronegative than \\(\\ce{I}\\), so \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) has the conventional oxidation number of \\(-1\\). Let's consider the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{I}\\) as \\(x\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*} x+4\\times\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1\\\\ x-4 &amp; =-1\\\\ x &amp; =-1+4\\\\ x &amp; =+3 \\end{align*}\\]    Predicting the products of an oxidation or reduction reaction We can predict the outcome of the reaction between two redox couples such as \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\/\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) in the following way: Because each redox reaction involves the movement of electrons, it also a voltage associated with it. This is called the standard reduction potential \\(\\left(E^{0}\\right)\\) which is defined according to \\[ Ox^{n+}+ne^{-}\\rightarrow Red \\] Where \\(Ox^{n+}=\\) the oxidised form of the element, \\(Red=\\) the reduced form of the element, \\(n=\\) the number of electrons transferred in the redox half-reactions \\(E^{0}\\) range: \\(E^{0}=\\) Standard reduction potential, this is the electron driving force for the reaction as it proceeds from left to right when both \\(Ox^{n+}\\) and \\(Red\\) are present at \\(1M\\) concentration (or one atmosphere partial pressure for gases), and at \\(25^{0}C.\\) NOTE: The greater (more positive) the value of \\(E^{0}\\), the greater the tendency for: \\(Ox^{n+}+ne^{-}\\rightarrow Red\\) So, from the data in the table below we can decide on the spontaneous (favourable) reaction:          \\(Ox^{n+}\/Red\\) couple \\(E^{0}\\)(volt) \\(e^{-}\\) donor\/acceptor Oxidising or Reducing Agents     \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) \\(+1.51\\) \\(e^{-}\\) acceptors Oxidising agent   \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\/\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\left(\\ce{SO}_{2}\\right)\\) \\(+0.17\\) \\(e^{-}\\) donor Reducing agent    It is crucial to note that the redox couple with the more positive \\(E^{0}\\) value will remove electrons from a redox couple with a less positive \\(E^{0}\\). The oxidising agent is the species which causes the oxidation to occur, i.e. It is the agent (redox couple) which removes electrons from the other couple. In the example above, \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) has the more positive \\(E^{0}\\) and hence the greater affinity (liking) for electrons: therefore \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) will be as the electron acceptor (i.e. Oxidant= oxidising agent). The sulphur system must donate electrons: hence \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) will be the electron donor (ie Reducing agent). So we predict: \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\)   Reduction and oxidation half-reactions and the balancing of redox equations Redox equations are usually written as balanced net ionic equations, with spectator ions (ions that do not take part in the overall redox process) being omitted. The determination of the stoichiometry of a redox reaction can be difficult to deduce even when the products of such a reaction are known. For this reason it is much more convenient and methodical to concentrate upon the stoichiometry of each redox \"half-reaction\" or \"redox couple\" individually.  Balancing net ionic equations for redox reactions A five step method for balancing redox equations, called the \"half-reaction\" method, is used, and after mastering these operations, any chemical redox equation can be balanced by combining the five steps.   Divide the equation into the appropriate \"half-reactions\" which can be balanced separately, for example: Overall reaction \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+\\ce{Mn}^{2+} \\] Assign an oxidation number to each element in the ions or molecules of reactants and products: The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) in \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) is \\(+7\\) and the \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) oxidation number in \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) is \\(+2\\) Thus, \\(\\ce{Mn}^{7+}\\)is being reduced to \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\). So, the reduction half-reaction is \\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+} \\] The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) is \\(+4\\), and the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) ion is \\(+6\\) So, \\(\\ce{S}\\) is being oxidised from \\(+4\\rightarrow+6\\). So, the oxidation half-reaction \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-} \\]   Write a separate balanced chemical equation for each redox-active species. This is the mass balance step: Add water to balance oxygen. \\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\] Add \\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\) to balance hydrogens. \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+} \\]   Although we have now achieved mass balance, we also need to balance the charge, by adding electrons (negative charge) as needed. This generates the balanced electrochemical half-reaction. The total charge on each side of a balanced reaction must be the same. \\[ \\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}+5e\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O} \\] Left hand side (LHS) total charge \\(=+2\\) Right hand side (RHS) total charge \\(=+2\\) And \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}+2e \\] LHS total charge \\(=0\\) RHS total charge \\(=0\\) If all three steps have been done correctly, one half-reaction will have electrons on the left hand side of the equation (the reduction half-reaction), while the other half-reaction will have electrons on the right hand side of the equation (the oxidation half-reaction).   The balanced half-reactions can be termed electrochemical equations, since they involve the electrons. To obtain a chemical equation for the reaction, we need to eliminate the electrons from the overall equation. Hence the fourth step is the addition of the two half-reactions in such a way that the electrons cancel out. This may require multiplying one equation or both, by an appropriate integer. For the two half-reactions above: \\[\\begin{align*} 2 &amp; \\left\\{ 5e+8\\ce{H}^{+}\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\right\\} \\\\ 5 &amp; \\left\\{ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\rightleftarrows\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}+2e\\right\\} \\end{align*}\\] The first reaction is multiplied by two and the second reaction is multiplied by five, and both are added to give: \\[ 5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+2\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+16\\ce{H}^{+}+5\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+10e\\rightleftarrows2\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+5\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+20\\ce{H}^{+}+8\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}+10e \\] Note the equal number of electrons on each side of the equation cancel out.   The final step is to cancel the electrons and simplify the chemical equation by eliminating any chemical species common to each side of the equation.

When we dissolve a solute in a solvent, we can obtain a solution.\n\\[\\require{mhchem}\\]\nSolute, solvent and solution\nA solution is composed of a solute and a solvent. When we dissolve a solute in a solvent, we can obtain a solution. To prepare a solution, a known mass of solute (e.g. \\(5.85\\textrm{g}\\) of \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\)) is dissolved in a solvent such as liquid water to give a known volume of solution (e.g. \\(250.0\\textrm{ml}\\) aqueous solution).\n\nIn a solution, the solvent can be liquid water or something else such as alcohol-based solvents, acetone and ethyl ether. If the solvent is liquid water, we call the solution an aqueous solution. If the solvent is not liquid water, we call it a nonaqueous solution.\nSolubility\nIn general, solubility depends on whether the solute (usually a solid) is ionic or molecular and whether the solvent liquid contains polar or non-polar molecules.\nIonic solutes in polar solvents\nExample: Solubility of sodium chloride in water.\n\nForces between the ions (\\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)): electrostatic interactions\n\nForces between solvent (\\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)) molecules: dipole-dipole interactions (electrostatic interactions)\n\nSo, the nature of the forces between solute and solvent are comparable. Hence, the strong electrostatic forces between ions in the crystal lattice can be matched by the ion-dipole electrostatic interaction between ions and the polar solvent molecules. Thus, we can expect ionic (polar) solutes to be soluble in polar solvents.\nMolecular solutes in non-polar solvents\nExample: Solubility of iodine (\\(\\ce{I}_{2}\\)) in octane (\\(\\ce{C}_{8}\\ce{H}_{18}\\)).\n\nForces between solute molecules (\\(\\ce{I}_{2}\\)) : Van der Waals forces\n\nForces between solvent (\\(\\ce{C}_{8}\\ce{H}_{18}\\)) molecules: Van der Waals forces\n\nThe forces between the solute and the solvent molecules are comparable. Hence we can expect solubility. In this case, both solute and the solvent are molecular, so when solute contacts solvent, the molecules freely intermingle. Molecular compounds (e.g. iodine) are therefore generally soluble in non-polar liquids (e.g. Hydrocarbons such as octane).\nSolubility rule\n\n\n\n\"Like dissolves like.\"\n\n\n\nPolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents.\n\nNon-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents.\n\nCompare the water solubility of hexane and glucose.\n\n \tWater is a polar liquid.\n \tHexane \\(\\left(\\ce{C}_{6}\\ce{H}_{14}\\right)\\) is a hydrocarbon chain. Therefore, it is a non-polar solute. So hexane is insoluble in water.\n \tGlucose \\(\\ce{C}_{6}\\ce{H}_{12}\\ce{O}_{6}\\) is a polar solute due to the presence of many hydroxyl groups \\(\\left(\\ce{OH}\\right)\\) in its structure. Thus, glucose is soluble in water.\n\nInfluence of temperature on solubility\nMany solids show increased solubility in water at higher temperature. In contrast, gases display low solubility in water with increased temperature.\nSaturated, supersaturated and unsaturated solutions\nThe unsaturated solution contains fewer solutes than the maximum amount that can be dissolved under given conditions.\n\nA saturated solution is a solution that contains the maximum amount of solutes that can be dissolved under the given conditions. In a saturated solution, an undissolved solid can be observed on the bottom of the container. There is a dynamic equilibrium between dissolved solutes and undissolved solutes at the molecular level. Some of the dissolved solutes crystallise back, and some of the undissolved solutes dissolve into the solution creating a dynamic equilibrium, even though you can not observe that with the naked eye.\n\nA supersaturated solution contains more dissolved solute molecules than a saturated solution - this is an unstable temporary condition. A supersaturated solution always tries to revert to a saturated state with time.","excerpt":"A solution is composed of a solute and a solvent.

Scientists use different methods to express concentration. Depending on the method, the units differ. Different methods of expressing concentration   Percent concentration (%)   Parts per million (ppm)   Parts per billion (ppb)   Molarity (M)    Percent concentration There are three ways of expressing concentration as a percentage.   mass\/mass percent concentration, (m\/m)% \\[ \\frac{\\textrm{mass of solute}\\left(g\\right)}{\\textrm{mass of solution$\\left(g\\right)$ }}\\times100 \\] Example: What is the percentage by mass concentration of a sodium chloride solution prepared by dissolving \\(3.25\\textrm{g}\\) of sodium chloride in \\(42.50\\textrm{g}\\) of water? The solute and the solvent masses are given, and we are asked to calculate the percent concentration of sodium chloride by mass.   volume\/volume percent concentration, (v\/v)% \\[ \\frac{\\textrm{volume of solute}\\left(ml\\right)}{\\textrm{volume of solution}\\left(ml\\right)}\\times100 \\] Example: If \\(8.00ml\\) of ethanol is dissolved in enough water to give \\(80.00ml\\) of&nbsp;solution, what is the percent by volume concentration of ethanol in the resulting solution? We are asked to calculate the ethanol concentration in percentage by volume. The solute and the solution volumes are given. \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{\\textrm{volume of solute}\\left(ml\\right)}{\\textrm{volume of solution}\\left(ml\\right)}\\times100\\\\ = &amp; \\frac{8.00ml}{80.00ml}\\times100\\\\ = &amp; 10.0\\% \\end{align*}\\]   mass\/volume percent concentration, (m\/v)% \\[ \\frac{\\textrm{mass of solute}\\left(g\\right)}{\\textrm{volume of solution}\\left(ml\\right)}\\times100 \\] Example: If \\(5.0g\\) of \\(\\ce{MgCl}_{2}\\) is dissolved in enough water to give \\(200\\textrm{ml}\\) of solution, calculate the concentration of \\(\\ce{MgCl}_{2}\\) in (m\/v)%. We are asked to calculate the concentration of \\(\\ce{MgCl}_{2}\\) in (m\/v)%. Mass of the \\(\\ce{MgCl}_{2}\\) and volume of the resulting solution are given. \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{\\textrm{mass of solute}\\left(g\\right)}{\\textrm{volume of solution}\\left(ml\\right)}\\times100\\\\ = &amp; \\frac{5.0g}{200ml}\\times100\\\\ = &amp; 2.5\\% \\end{align*}\\]     Parts Per Million and Parts Per Billion Parts per million - number of parts (mass or volume) present in one million parts (mass or volume). Parts per billion - number of parts (mass or volume) present in one billion parts (mass or volume). Parts can be in either mass or volume units. Both solute and solvent must have the same units. For example, one gram of solute is present in a million grams of solution, one millilitre of benzene is present in a million millilitres of air. \\[ 1ppm=\\frac{1ml}{1000000ml}\\times1000000 \\] Example: Drinking water contains \\(0.002g\\) of \\(\\ce{Mg}^{+}\\)ions in \\(100g\\) of water. What is this concentration in parts per million? We are asked to calculate the given concentration in ppm. \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{0.002g}{100g}\\times1000000\\\\ = &amp; 20ppm \\end{align*}\\]   Molarity (M) Molarity is the number of solute moles present in one litre of a solution. \\[ \\textrm{Molarity(M)}=\\frac{\\textrm{moles of solute}}{\\textrm{litres of solution}} \\] Example: If \\(2.50\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{CuSO}_{4}\\) are dissolved in enough water to give a \\(500.0\\mathscr{\\textrm{ml}}\\) solution, what is the molarity of the resulting solution? We are given the number of moles present in \\(500\\textrm{ml}\\) of a solution and asked to calculate the molarity. Molarity means the number of moles present in \\(1000\\textrm{ml}\\) \\(\\left(1\\textrm{L}\\right)\\) of solution. \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{2.50\\textrm{mol}}{500.0\\textrm{ml}}\\times1000\\textrm{ml}\\\\ = &amp; 5.00\\textrm{M} \\end{align*}\\]  Calculations using molarity as a conversion factor  Calculating the number of moles or the mass of a solute present in a known volume of a solution.  Example 1: How many moles of glucose are present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) of a \\(1.50\\textrm{M}\\) glucose solution? We are given the molarity of the solution and asked to calculate the number of moles present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) of the same solution. Molarity indicates the number of moles present in \\(1000\\textrm{ml}\\). So, we can use molarity as a conversion factor to calculate the number of moles present in a given volume as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{1.50\\textrm{mol}}{1000\\textrm{ml}}\\times250\\textrm{ml}\\\\ = &amp; 0.375\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Example 2: How many grams of glucose are present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) of a \\(1.5\\textrm{M}\\) glucose solution? The molar mass of glucose is \\(180.15\\textrm{g\/mol}\\). Here, we are given the molarity of the solution and asked to calculate the mass of the solute present in a given volume. As in the previous example, we can use molarity as the conversion factor to get the number of moles of the solute present in the given volume. Then, use the \\(n=\\frac{m}{M}\\) equation to convert moles to grams. The number of moles of glucose present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) of solution: \\[\\begin{align*} = &amp; \\frac{1.50\\textrm{mol}}{1000\\textrm{ml}}\\times250\\textrm{ml}\\\\ = &amp; 0.375\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] Grams of glucose present in \\(250\\textrm{ml}\\) solution \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n\\times M &amp; =m\\\\ 0.375\\textrm{mol}\\times180.15\\textrm{g\/mol} &amp; =m\\\\ m &amp; =67.6\\textrm{g} \\end{align*}\\]  Calculating the volume of a solution from a given quantity of a solute.  Example: How many millilitres of a \\(1.00\\textrm{M}\\) \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) solution would be required to obtain \\(7.3\\textrm{g}\\) of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\)? The molar mass of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) is \\(36.458\\textrm{g\/mol}\\). We are given the molarity of the solution and asked to calculate the volume that the given grams of the solute would present. First, convert the grams of the solute into moles using \\(n=\\frac{m}{M}\\). Then use molarity as the conversion factor to find the volume that the calculated moles would present. Number of moles of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) corresponds to \\(7.3\\textrm{g}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; =\\frac{m}{M}\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{7.3\\textrm{g}}{36.458\\textrm{g\/mol}}\\\\ n &amp; =0.20\\textrm{mol} \\end{align*}\\] The volume that the \\(0.20\\textrm{mol}\\) of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) would present: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1000\\textrm{ml}}{1.00\\textrm{mol}}\\times0.20\\textrm{mol} &amp; =200\\textrm{ml} \\end{align*}\\]    Dilution of Solutions Dilution is a process used to lower the concentration of the original solution by adding more solvent. The concentrated solution is known as the stock solution. However, the amount of solute present in the solution remains constant before and after the dilution; only the volume changes. The following equation shows the relationship between concentration and volume before and after dilution. This equation is built upon the fact that the same amount of solute is present in the solution before (stock solution) and after (diluted solution) the dilution. \\[ C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2} \\] Where; \\(C_{1}\\)= Concentration of the stock solution \\(V_{1}\\)= Volume of the stock solution \\(C_{2}\\)= Concentration of the diluted solution \\(V_{2}\\)= Volume of the diluted solution Example: A chemist prepared \\(10\\textrm{ml}\\) of a \\(1.00\\textrm{M}\\) \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) solution by adding water to the \\(3.0\\textrm{M}\\) stock solution of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\). How much stock solution should be taken for the dilution? We are given the concentration of the diluted solution, the volume of the diluted solution, concentration of the stock solution, and we are asked to calculate the volume of the stock solution used for the dilution. As the number of solute moles remains constant before and after the dilution, we can use the equation \\(C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}\\) to calculate the volume of the stock solution. \\[\\begin{align*} C_{1}V_{1} &amp; =C_{2}V_{2}\\\\ 3.0\\textrm{M}\\times V_{1} &amp; =1.0\\textrm{M}\\times10\\textrm{ml}\\\\ V_{1} &amp; =\\frac{1.0\\textrm{M}\\times10\\textrm{ml}}{3.0\\textrm{M}}\\\\ V_{1} &amp; =3.3\\textrm{ml} \\end{align*}\\]  ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1560 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Concentration refers to the amount of solute present in a given quantity (known volume) of a solution.

It classifies elements into categories and makes predictions about elements that have not yet been found by humans. Alchemical table to periodic table Before modern science, elements referred to earth, air, water, and fire. The periodic table grew from the alchemical table. The alchemical table was also a way of ordering elements and substances and their corresponding symbols. As more elements were discovered and a modern understanding of chemistry emerged, some things were removed from the table and others were added, beginning with phosphorus. Hennig Brand is the first person credited with discovering a modern element. Brand was an alchemist searching for the philosopher's stone. He distilled many substances, including urine, and from human urine he made pure phosphorus. Adding oxygen to the mix Antoine Lavoisier is called the father of modern chemistry by many. Lavoisier discovered oxygen and hydrogen and correctly explained the role of oxygen in combustion &ndash; fire. Lavoisier also predicted the existence of silica. His work was ground-breaking and very important to modern chemistry. Many people contributed to the history of chemistry and the periodic table and discovered elements, building on the work of Lavoisier. Atomic weight Mendeleev was a Russian scientist who moved elements into the table structure we know today. HIs big breakthrough on the periodic table came in 1869 when he arranged the elements on the table by atomic weight, starting with the lightest elements. By ordering the elements by atomic weight, and into columns, he was able to correctly predict elements that had not yet been discovered. Mendeleev also knew that the proposed atomic weights of some elements were incorrect, and again correctly predicted what the actual weight is. Periodic law Grouping the elements by atomic weight also led to Mendeleev discovering the periodic law. This law states that by grouping elements by atomic weight, we see cyclical trends in their properties emerging in a predictable and stable way.  The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) have an interactive periodic table where you can learn the history of each element and who discovered it.

It introduces the concept of a scalar (which is a quantity without a direction such as heat or thermal energy).\n\nKeywords(tags): Dynamics, Maths, Physics, Vectors\n\n\n\n   The modern idea of vectors appeared late in the 19th century when Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside (of USA and Britain, respectively) independently developed vector analysis to express the new laws of electromagnetism discovered by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. This page Introduces the basic concepts around vectors (which are measurable quantities with direction such as force). It introduces the concept of a scalar (which is a quantity without a direction such as heat or thermal energy).  It covers vector components (aligned along the horizontal and vertical or the 3-dimensional axes), unit vectors (a vector of size = 1), vector magnitude (or size) and how to add and subtract vectors.   Vectors and Scalars One example of a vector is velocity . The velocity of an object is determined by the magnitude (speed) and direction of travel. Other examples of vectors are force, displacement and acceleration. A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude only. Mass, time and volume are all examples of scalar quantities. Vectors in three-dimensional space are defined by three mutually perpendicular directions and and can be denoted as bold letters or as in this worksheet \\(\\vec{a}\\) or \\(\\vec{b}\\) or \\(\\vec{c}.\\) A vector in the opposite direction from \\(\\vec{a}\\) is denoted by \\(-\\vec{a}\\). Vectors can be added or subtracted graphically using the triangle rule.   Adding and Subtracting Vectors Triangle Rule:  To add vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) shown above place the tail of vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) at the head of vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) (point Q). The vector sum, \\(\\vec{a}+\\vec{b},\\) is the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{PR}\\) , from the tail of vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) to the head of \\(\\vec{b}.\\) To subtract \\(\\vec{b}\\) from \\(\\vec{a}\\), reverse the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) to give \\(-\\vec{b}\\) then add \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(-\\vec{b}\\). \\(\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}=\\vec{a}+(-\\vec{b})\\)  Vector \\(\\overrightarrow{PR}\\) is equal to the vector \\(\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}\\).   Components of a Vector In the diagram below the vector \\(\\vec{r}\\) is represented by \\(\\overrightarrow{OP}\\) where \\(P\\) is the point \\((x,y,z)\\). if \\(\\vec{i}\\) ,\\(\\vec{j}\\) , and \\(\\vec{k}\\) are vectors of magnitude one1 A vector of magnitude one is called a unit vector. Magnitude of vectors and unit vectors are discussed later in this module. parallel to the positive directions of the \\(x\\)- axis , \\(y\\)-axis and \\(z\\)-axis respectively, then: \\(x\\vec{i}\\) is a vector of length x in the direction of the \\(x\\)-axis \\(y\\vec{i}\\) is a vector of length y in the direction of the \\(y\\)-axis \\(z\\vec{k}\\) is a vector of length z in the direction of the \\(z\\)-axis \\(\\overrightarrow{OP}\\) is then the vector \\(x\\vec{i}+y\\vec{j}+z\\vec{k}\\) \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are called the components of the vector.  The notation \\((x,y,z)\\) will be used to denote the vector \\(\\vec{r}=(x\\vec{i}+y\\vec{j}+z\\vec{k})\\) as well as the co-ordinates of a point \\(P\\) \\((x,y,z)\\). The context will determine the correct meaning. Vectors may also be added or subtracted by adding or subtracting their corresponding components.  Example If \\(\\vec{a}=(-3,4,2)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=(-1,-2,3)\\) , find: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}+\\vec{b} &amp; =(-3,4,2)+(-1,-2,3)\\\\ &amp; =(-3+(-1),4+(-2),2+3)\\\\ &amp; =(-4,2,5) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}-\\vec{b} &amp; =(-3,4,2)-(-1,-2,3)\\\\ &amp; =(-3-(-1),4-(-2),2-3)\\\\ &amp; =(-2,6,-1) \\end{align*}\\] See Exercise 1.    Directed Line Segment The directed line segment, or geometric vector, \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) , from\\(P(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})\\) to \\(Q(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})\\) is found by subtracting the co-ordinates of \\(P\\) (the initial point) from the co-ordinates of \\(Q\\) (the final point).   \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}=(x_{2}-x_{1})\\vec{i}+(y_{2}-y_{1})\\vec{j}+(z_{2}-z_{1})\\vec{k}\\)    Example  \\(PQ=(5-3)i+(6-4)+(-1-1)k\\) \\(PQ=2i+2j-2k\\) The directed line segment \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) is represented by the vector \\(2\\vec{i}+2\\vec{j}-2\\vec{k}\\), or \\((2,2,-2)\\). Any other directed line segment with the same length and same direction as \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) is also represented by \\(2\\vec{i}+2\\vec{j}-2\\vec{k}\\) or \\((2,2,-2)\\). The directed line segment \\(\\overrightarrow{QP}\\) has the same length as \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) but is in the opposite direction. \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\overrightarrow{QP} &amp; =-\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\\\ &amp; =-(2\\vec{i}+2\\vec{j}-2\\vec{k})\\\\ &amp; =-2\\vec{i}-2\\vec{j}+2\\vec{k}\\\\ is\\ also\\ &amp; =(-2,-2,2) \\end{alignat*}\\]    Position Vector The position vector of any point is the directed line segment from the origin \\(O\\) \\((0,0,0)\\) to that point and is given by the co-ordinates of of the point. The position vector of \\(P(3,4,1)\\) is \\(3\\vec{i}+4\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}\\), or \\((3,4,1)\\). See Exercise 2.   Magnitude of a vector if \\(\\vec{a}=a_{1}\\vec{i}+a_{2}\\vec{j}+a_{3}\\vec{k}\\) the length or magnitude of \\(\\vec{a}\\) is written as \\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) or \\('\\vec{a}'\\) and is evaluated as:   \\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|=\\sqrt{(a_{1})^{2}+(a_{2})^{2}+(a_{3})^{2}}\\)    Example The length of the vector \\(2\\vec{i}+3\\vec{j}-5\\vec{k}\\) equals \\(\\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}+(-5)^{2}}=\\sqrt{38}\\) In this case \\(a_{1}=2,a_{2}=3,a_{3}=-5\\) \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\) are referred to as the components of vector \\(\\vec{a}\\).    Unit Vector Any vector with a magnitude of one is called a unit vector. If \\(\\vec{a}\\) is any vector then a unit vector parallel to \\(\\vec{a}\\) is written \\(\\hat{a}\\) (a \u201chat\u201d). The \u201chat\u201d symbolises a unit vector. The unit vector \\(\\hat{a}\\) equals vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) divided by its magnitude \\(\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) .   \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\hat{a} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}\\\\ Rearanging\\ &amp; \\ gives\\\\ \\vec{a} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\hat{a} \\end{alignat*}\\]   Of particular importance are unit vectors \\(\\vec{i}\\), \\(\\vec{j}\\) and \\(\\vec{k}\\), parallel to the \\(x\\) , \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) axes respectively.  Examples  If \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) is the line \\(2\\vec{i}-5\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}\\) find a unit vector parallel to \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\)  \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}=\\sqrt{2^{2}+\\left(-5\\right)^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{30}\\) A unit vector parallel to \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) is : \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\overrightarrow{PQ} &amp; =\\frac{\\overrightarrow{PQ}}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(2\\vec{i}-5\\vec{j}+\\vec{k})}{\\sqrt{30}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{30}}(2\\vec{i}-5\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}) \\end{alignat*}\\]  if \\(\\vec{a}\\) \\(=(1,2,3)\\) a unit vector parallel to \\(\\vec{a}\\) is:  \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\hat{a} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(1i+2j+3k)}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(1i+2j+3k)}{\\sqrt{14}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{14}}(1i+2j+3k) \\end{alignat*}\\] see Exercise 3.    Multiplication by a Scalar To multiply a vector \\(\\vec{a}=\\) \\(a_{1}\\vec{i}+a_{2}\\vec{j}+a_{3}\\vec{k}\\) by a scalar, \\(m\\), multiply each component of \\(\\vec{a}\\) by \\(m\\).   \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} m\\vec{a} &amp; =ma_{1}\\vec{i}+ma_{2}\\vec{j}+ma_{3}\\vec{k} \\end{alignat*}\\]   The result is a vector of length \\(m\\times\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) If \\(m&gt;0\\) the resultant vector is in the same direction as \\(\\vec{a}\\) If \\(m&lt;0\\) the resultant vector is in the opposite direction from \\(\\vec{a}\\). Two vectors a and b are said to be parallel if and only if \\(\\vec{a}=k\\vec{b}\\) where \\(k\\) is a real constant.  Example Multiply \\(\\vec{a}=(3\\vec{i}+\\vec{j}-2\\vec{k})\\) by \\(7\\) and show \\(\\left|7\\vec{a}\\right|=7\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} 7\\vec{a} &amp; =7(3\\vec{i}+\\vec{j}-2\\vec{k})\\\\ &amp; =21\\vec{i}+7\\vec{j}-14\\vec{k}\\\\ so\\ that\\\\ \\left|7\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{21^{2}+7^{2}+(-14)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{686}=\\sqrt{49\\times14}\\\\ &amp; =7\\sqrt{14} \\end{alignat*}\\] Also the magnitude of \\(\\vec{a}\\) is \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{3^{2}+1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{14}\\\\ 7\\left|\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =7\\sqrt{14} \\end{alignat*}\\] Therefore we can derive: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|7\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =7\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|=7\\sqrt{14}. \\end{alignat*}\\] See Exercise 4.    Exercise 1 Given \\(\\vec{a}=(2,1,1)\\) , \\(\\vec{b}=(1,3,-3)\\) and \\(\\vec{c}=(0,3,-2)\\) find:  \\(\\vec{a}+\\vec{b}\\)  \\(\\vec{a}+\\vec{c}\\)  \\(\\vec{c}-\\vec{b}\\)  \\(\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}\\).

Vector quantities in combination will enhance or counteract each other, depending on their direction. An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.  This task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics. As with other types of vectors (displacement, velocity, etc.), a force vector can be thought of as being the sum of several other vectors. Imagining that a single force is made up of several forces can greatly simplify calculations, particularly using two imaginary ones at right angles to each other. Usually broken up into vertical and horizontal components. We discuss how to calculate these components in this module.  Components of a Force If you pull on an object with a force \\(\\vec{F}\\) (see diagram below left), the effect is the same as two other people pulling with forces \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) at right angles to each other , one horizontal and the other vertical (see diagram below right).  The vector triangle showing the force \\(\\vec{F}\\) and its component vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is shown. The force \\(\\vec{F}\\) can be imagined as having two parts, or components, \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) that are at right angles to each other. \\(\\vec{a}\\) is usually called the horizontal component and \\(\\vec{b}\\) the vertical component of \\(\\vec{F}\\). The components are often called rectangular components because they are at right angles to each other.  For the diagram at right it can be seen that the magnitude of the vectors give: \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{\\left|b\\right|}}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] Transposing gives: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{\\left|b\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\sin\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\] and \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{alignat*}\\] Transposing gives: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\]  Example 1 Calculate the rectangular components of a force of 10 Newton that acts in a direction of North 30 degrees East? Since there is 90 degrees in a right angle triangle we can deduce that the direction of force can be shown as East 60 degrees North. The force and its rectangular components are shown. One component , \\(\\vec{a}\\), is acting to the East , the other , \\(\\vec{b}\\) , is to the North. The magnitudes of these forces can be calculated:  \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{\\left|a\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\cos\\theta\\\\ &amp; =10\\cos60\\\\ &amp; =5Newton \\end{align*}\\] also: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{\\left|b\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\sin\\theta\\\\ &amp; =10\\sin60\\\\ &amp; =8.7Newton. \\end{alignat*}\\] Thus, the 10 Newton force can be resolved into two rectangular components: 5 Newton to the East and 8.7 Newton to the North.   Example 2 A small boat is being towed at constant speed along a canal by two men walking along the banks on opposite sides pulling with equal forces of \\(1000\\) Newton at equal angles on ropes attached to the boat. \\(\\theta=60\\) degrees. Calculate the force each man pulls on the rope \\((a)\\) parallel to the bank, and \\((b)\\) at right angles to the bank. The force towards the Jetty an be defined as \\(\\vec{F_{1}}\\) and the force towards the other bank can be defined as \\(\\vec{F_{2}}\\).  Solution: The 1000 Newton force: \\((a)\\) A component force parallel to the bank of \\(\\left|\\vec{a_{1}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{1}\\right|\\cos\\theta=1000\\cos60=500\\) Newton and \\(\\vec{\\left|a_{2}\\right|}=\\left|\\vec{F}_{2}\\right|\\cos\\theta=1000\\cos60=500\\) Newton \\((b)\\) A component force at right angles to the bank of \\(\\left|\\vec{b_{1}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{1}\\right|\\sin\\theta=1000\\sin60=866\\) Newton towards the jetty \\(\\left|\\vec{b_{2}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{2}\\right|\\sin\\theta=1000\\sin60=866\\) Newton away from the jetty  Note that the two components at right angles to the bank are equal in size, but are in opposite directions, so they cancel each other. So the boat will only move parallel to the banks. Note: There is zero resultant force at right angles to the Jetty. \\(866\\) N towards the Jetty and \\(866\\) N away from the Jetty. The two components parallel to the banks are in the same direction so the force pulling the boat forwards is: \\(\\left|\\vec{a_{1}}\\right|+\\left|\\vec{a_{2}}\\right|=500+500=2\\times F\\cos\\theta\\) \\(=2\\times500=1000\\) Newton. The balancing force causing the boat to move at constant speed is the friction or drag of the boat through the water acting in the opposite direction.

It is also possible to resolve one vector along the line of another vector (instead of along the x-y axes).   (See also Linear graphs)  Learn how to find the projection (resolution) of one vector in the direction of a second vector.  There are two types of vector projection:  Scalar projection Vector projection  For scalar projection, we calculate the length (a scalar quantity) of a vector in a particular direction. For vector projection we calculate the vector component of a vector in a given direction. Often, in Physics, Engineering and Mathematics courses you are asked to resolve a vector into two component vectors that are perpendicular to one another. As an example, in the diagram below a vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) is the projection of \\(\\overrightarrow{F}\\) in the horizontal direction while \\(\\vec{b}\\) is the projection of \\(\\overrightarrow{F}\\) in the vertical direction.  You can project a vector in any direction, not only horizontally and vertically. This module discusses both scalar and vector projections.  Scalar Projection Consider the following diagram:  Let \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}=\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{PS}=\\vec{b}.\\) The scalar projection of the vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) is the length of the straight line \\(PR\\) or \\(\\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right|\\)where 1 Remember that the magnitude (or length) of a vector \\(\\vec{v}=v_{1}\\vec{i}+v_{2}\\vec{j}+v_{3}\\vec{k}\\) is denoted by \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\vec{v}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}} \\end{align*}\\] For example, if \\(\\vec{v}=2\\vec{i}-3\\vec{j}+\\vec{k}\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\vec{v}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{2^{2}+\\left(-3\\right)^{2}+1^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{4+9+1}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{14} \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(\\theta\\right) &amp; =\\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right|}{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging gives, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right). &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] This may be written in terms of the dot product.2 The dot product (or scalar product) of two vectors \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a} &amp; =a_{1}\\vec{i}+a_{2}\\vec{j}+a_{3}\\vec{k}\\\\ \\vec{b} &amp; =b_{1}\\vec{i}+b_{2}\\vec{j}+b_{3}\\vec{k} \\end{align*}\\] is defined to be \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right) \\end{align*}\\] An alternate definition is \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3}. \\end{align*}\\] We know \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\left(\\theta\\right) &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this expression for \\(\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) into eqn\\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)\\\\ \\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\cdot\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot b}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\vec{a}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\vec{a}\\cdot\\hat{b} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{b}=\\frac{\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}\\) is the unit vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\).3 A unit vector for the vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) is denoted by \\(\\hat{b}\\) and is the vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) divided by its length \\(\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{b} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] A unit vector is a vector of length one in the direction of the original vector.

Solution: The magnitude of \\(\\vec{b}\\) is \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\vec{b}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{5^{2}+(-2)^{2}+2^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{25+4+4}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{33} \\end{alignat*}\\] therefore \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\hat{b} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(5,-2,2)}{\\sqrt{33}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{33}}(5,-2,2) \\end{alignat*}\\] so the scalar projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) is: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\hat{b} &amp; =(2,3,1)\\cdot\\frac{(5,-2,2)}{\\sqrt{33}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(2\\times5\\right)+\\left(3\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)+\\left(1\\times2\\right)}{\\sqrt{33}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10-6+2}{\\sqrt{33}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{33}}. \\end{alignat*}\\]    Vector Projection The vector projection of a vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) is a vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) with magnitude equal to the length of the straight line \\(PR\\) or \\(\\left|\\overrightarrow{PR}\\right|\\) as shown below.  Therefore the vector projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) is the scalar projection multiplied by a unit vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\).   The vector projection of vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) is: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\hat{b}\\right)\\hat{b} &amp; =\\frac{\\left(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\right)\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|^{2}} \\end{alignat*}\\]    Example 1 Find the vector projection of vector \\(\\vec{a}=(2,3,1)\\) in the direction of vector \\(\\vec{b}=(5,-2,2)\\). Solution: The vector projection \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) equals:4 Remember that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\vec{b}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{5^{2}+(-2)^{2}+2^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{33} \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\hat{b}\\right)\\hat{b} &amp; =\\frac{\\left(\\vec{a\\cdot}\\vec{b}\\right)\\vec{b}}{\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(\\left(2,3,1\\right)\\cdot\\left(5,-2,2\\right)\\right)\\left(5,-2,2\\right)}{\\left(\\sqrt{33}\\right)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(2\\times5+3\\times\\left(-2\\right)+1\\times2\\right)\\left(5,-2,2\\right)}{33}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(10-6+2\\right)\\left(5,-2,2\\right)}{33}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(6\\right)\\left(5,-2,2\\right)}{33} \\end{alignat*}\\] The vector projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) is \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{6\\left(5,-2,2\\right)}{33} &amp; =\\frac{6}{33}\\left(5,-2,2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{11}\\left(5\\hat{i}-2\\hat{j}+2\\hat{k}\\right). \\end{alignat*}\\]   Example 2 If \\(\\vec{a}=(1,-2,2)\\) and \\(\\vec{b}=(5,-2,2)\\) find: \\((a)\\) The scalar projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\). \\((b)\\) The vector projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\). Solution: \\((a)\\) The scalar projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{b}\\) is \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\hat{b}\\).

You can also define a point with a 3-dimensional vector through it. This process uses three types of equations.  Learn how to find the vector equation, the parametric equation, and the symmetric equation of a line in three-dimensional space.   Introduction You have probably been taught that a line in the \\(x-y\\) plane can be represented in the form \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient ( or slope) of the line and \\(c\\) is the \\(y-\\)intercept. But how do we define a line in three dimensions (3D)? 1 Three dimensional space (3D) is a geometric setting in which three co-ordinates are required to determine the position of a point. This is different to when we are dealing with points in the \\(x-y\\) plane where only two co-ordinates are required. This module deals with the equation of a line in 3D.   Vector Equation of a Line in 3D A line in 3D space can be described by a point and a vector along the line. There is only one line that can be drawn through a given point in the direction of a given vector. Consider the figure below:  Here  \\(\\vec{r_{1}}\\) and \\(\\vec{r}_{2}\\) are two points on the line; \\(P_{0}\\left(x,y,z\\right)\\) is a point on the line and \\(\\vec{P}_{0}\\) is it\u2019s position vector; \\(\\vec{V}\\) is a vector along the line; \\(t\\) is a constant. That is \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). To get to the point \\(R_{1}\\) you first need to get onto the line. You do this by traveling along \\(\\vec{P}_{0}\\) to the point \\(P_{0}\\) on the line and then traveling a distance along the line in the direction of vector \\(\\vec{V}\\) . So we could write \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r}_{1} &amp; =\\vec{P}_{0}+t\\vec{V} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is a positive constant. The quantity \\(t\\vec{V}\\) represents the distance and the direction we need to go along the line to get to the point \\(R_{1}\\) from \\(P_{0}\\) .  To get to the point \\(R_{2}\\) you first need to get onto the line. You do this by traveling along \\(\\vec{P}_{0}\\) to the point \\(P_{0}\\) on the line and then traveling a distance along the line in the opposite direction of vector \\(\\vec{V}\\) . So we could write \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r}_{1} &amp; =\\vec{P}_{0}+t\\vec{V} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is a negative constant (because we are going in the direction opposite to \\(\\vec{V}\\)). Considering the above, we hope you understand the equation of a line, in vector form, is \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r} &amp; =\\vec{P_{0}}+t\\vec{V} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is a constant. It is also possible to define the line in other forms as described below.   Parametric Equation of a Line in 3D  Suppose we wish to find the line that goes through the point \\(P_{0}\\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\\right)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\) . Consider a general point \\(P\\left(x,y,z\\right)\\) that lies on the line that goes through the point \\(P_{0}\\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\\right)\\) as shown at right. We can define a vector \\(\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}\\) by: \\[\\begin{align*} \\overrightarrow{P_{0}P} &amp; =\\left(x-x_{0}\\right)\\hat{i}+\\left(y-y_{0}\\right)\\hat{j}+\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)\\hat{k}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] This vector will obviously be in the same direction as \\(\\overrightarrow{V}\\) but will, in all likelihood have a different magnitude. In other words \\(\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}\\) will be a multiple of the direction vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}.\\) So \\(\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}=t\\overrightarrow{V}\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is some number. Hence: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{2} \\overrightarrow{P_{0}P} &amp; =t\\overrightarrow{V}\\\\ &amp; =t\\left(a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =at\\hat{i}+bt\\hat{j}+ct\\hat{k}. &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{alignat*}\\] Equating components of \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) we have, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-x_{0}\\right) &amp; =at\\\\ x &amp; =x_{0}+at &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(y-y_{0}\\right) &amp; =bt\\\\ y &amp; =y_{0}+bt &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(z-z_{0}\\right) &amp; =ct\\\\ z &amp; =z_{0}+ct. &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\]   These equations \\(x=x_{0}+at\\), \\(y=y_{0}+bt\\) and \\(z=z_{0}+ct\\) are called the parametric equations of the line that contains the point \\(\\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\\right)\\) and has the direction vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\). The variable \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is called a parameter.     Symmetric Form of the Line By rearranging \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) above we find: \\[\\begin{align*} t &amp; =\\frac{x-x_{0}}{a}\\\\ t &amp; =\\frac{y-y_{0}}{b}\\\\ t &amp; =\\frac{z-z_{0}}{c}. \\end{align*}\\]   Since they are all equal, we can say that: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-x_{0}}{a} &amp; =\\frac{y-y_{0}}{b}=\\frac{z-z_{0}}{c} &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\] This is called the symmetric form of the equation of the line.     Summary A line in 3D may be represented:  In vector form (see \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above) In parametric form (see \\(\\left(4-6\\right)\\) above) In symmetric form (see \\(\\left(7\\right)\\)above).    Example \\(1\\) Find the parametric and symmetric equations of the line that goes through the point \\((3,2,3)\\) and is in the direction of the vector \\(2\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}-5\\hat{k}\\) . Solution: Using equations \\(\\left(4-6\\right)\\) the parametric equations will be : \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =3+2t\\\\ y &amp; =2+t\\\\ z &amp; =3-5t. \\end{align*}\\] Using equation \\(\\left(7\\right)\\) the symmetric equations will be: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x-3}{2} &amp; =\\frac{y-2}{1}=\\frac{z-3}{-5} \\end{alignat*}\\] or \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x-3}{2} &amp; =y-2=\\frac{3-z}{5}. \\end{alignat*}\\]   Example \\(2\\) Find the parametric and symmetric equations of the line that goes through the point \\((1,3,2)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=\\hat{j}-2\\hat{k}\\) . Solution: The parametric equations will be: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =1+0t\\\\ &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =3+t\\\\ z &amp; =2-2t. \\end{align*}\\] The symmetric equation will be: \\[\\begin{align*} x=1 &amp; ;\\,y-3=\\frac{z-2}{-2} \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} x=1 &amp; ;\\,y-3=-\\frac{1}{2}z+1. \\end{align*}\\]   Example \\(3\\) Find the direction vector of the line : \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-6}{2} &amp; =\\frac{y-2}{-1}=\\frac{z}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The line is in symmetric form and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-6}{2} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{y-2}{-1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{z}{3} &amp; =t \\end{align*}\\] for any \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) Rearranging gives the parametric form: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6+2t\\\\ y &amp; =2-t\\\\ z &amp; =3t. \\end{align*}\\] This may be written in vector form as \\[\\begin{align*} x\\hat{i}+y\\hat{j}+z\\hat{k} &amp; =\\left(6\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\right)+t\\left(2\\hat{i}-\\hat{j}+3\\hat{k}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] which is a line through the point \\(\\left(6,2,0\\right)\\) in the direction \\(\\left(2\\hat{i}-\\hat{j}+3\\hat{k}\\right)\\). Hence the direction vector is \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=2\\hat{i}-\\hat{j}+3\\hat{k}\\). Note that the direction vector of the line could be any multiple of this vector.   Example 4 A line passes through the points \\(A(1,2,4)\\) and \\(B(3,-1,-2)\\). Find the equation of the line in a) vector format b) in parametric format and c) in symmetric format. Solution:  For vector format we need to find a vector along the line. This can be  2 Note that it is also valid to take the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\).\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\overrightarrow{AB} &amp; =\\left(3-1\\right)\\hat{i}+\\left(-1-2\\right)\\hat{j}+\\left(-2-4\\right)\\hat{k}\\\\ &amp; =2\\hat{i}-3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k} \\end{alignat*}\\] The vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) is the direction vector along the line. We can now use either point, \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) to find the equation of the line in vector format. So the possible vector forms are: \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r} &amp; =\\left(\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}+4\\hat{k}\\right)+t\\left(2\\hat{i}-3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}\\right) &amp; \\left(8\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and we have used point \\(A\\), or \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r} &amp; =\\left(3\\hat{i}-\\hat{j}-2\\hat{k}\\right)+t\\left(2\\hat{i}-3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}\\right) &amp; \\left(9\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where we have used point \\(B\\). Either is acceptable.  For the parametric equations, you can use either \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(9\\right)\\). We will use \\(\\left(8\\right)\\).Equating components, we have  3 Remember \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r} &amp; =x\\hat{i}+y\\hat{j}+z\\hat{k} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are the coordinates of any point on the line. \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{r} &amp; =\\left(1\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}+4\\hat{k}\\right)+t\\left(2\\hat{i}-3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}\\right)\\\\ x\\hat{i}+y\\hat{j}+z\\hat{k} &amp; =\\left(1\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}+4\\hat{k}\\right)+t\\left(2\\hat{i}-3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so the parametric equations are \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =1+2t &amp; \\left(10\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =2-3t &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =4-6t &amp; \\left(12\\right) \\end{align*}\\] are the parametric equations.  The symmetric equations are obtained by solving \\(\\left(10-12\\right)\\) for \\(t\\) to get  \\[\\begin{align*} t &amp; =\\frac{x-1}{2}\\\\ t &amp; =\\frac{2-y}{3}\\\\ t &amp; =\\frac{4-z}{6}. \\end{align*}\\] So the symmetric equations are: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x-1}{2} &amp; =\\frac{2-y}{3}=\\frac{4-z}{6}. \\end{alignat*}\\] Note that you will get different parametric and symmetric equations if you use \\(\\left(9\\right)\\) above. However they are acceptable solutions.   Exercise: Find the symmetric and parametric equations of the lines that satisfy the given conditions:  Contains the point \\(\\left(1,-1,2\\right)\\) with the direction vector \\(2\\hat{i}-2\\hat{j}+3\\hat{k}\\,\\)?

(See also Linear graphs) In order to find the point of intersection of two lines in three dimensional space, it is best to have both equations in parametric form. This module discusses how to determine whether two lines intersect or not.  Lines The equation of a line in three dimensional space can be written in either vector, parametric or symmetric form. Vector form is not so useful for determining whether two lines intersect. Parametric form is preferred for this purpose.  Parametric Form The parametric equations of a line through the point \\(\\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\\right)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\) is : \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =x_{0}+at\\\\ y &amp; =y_{0}+bt\\\\ z &amp; =z_{0}+ct \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is called a parameter. Note that \\(t\\) is merely a number. It has no physical significance and may be any symbol. Often \\(s\\) is used for the parameter.   Symmetric Form The symmetric form of a line through the point \\(\\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\\right)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{V}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\) is : \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-x_{0}}{a} &amp; =\\frac{y-y_{0}}{b}=\\frac{z-z_{0}}{c}. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\]   Converting to Parametric Form A line in symmetric form may be converted to parametric form by setting each term in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) equal to a parameter \\(s\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-x_{0}}{a} &amp; =s\\\\ \\frac{y-y_{0}}{b} &amp; =s\\\\ \\frac{z-z_{0}}{c} &amp; =s. \\end{align*}\\] These can then be rearranged to give the parametric form of the line: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =x_{0}+as\\\\ y &amp; =y_{0}+bs\\\\ z &amp; =z_{0}+cs \\end{align*}\\] where \\(s\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).    Finding the Intersection of Two Lines The idea is to write each of the two lines in parametric form. Different parameters must be used for each line, say \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). If the lines intersect, there must be values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) that give the same point on each of the lines. If this is not the case, the lines do not intersect. The basic approach is:  write each line in parametric form solve the simultaneous equations for the parameters if a solution exists the line intersect, if not they don\u2019t intersect.   Example 1 Find the point of intersection of the two lines \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) where \\(L_{1}\\) is the line represented by the equation \\(\\frac{x-5}{1}=\\frac{y-1}{-1}=\\frac{z-8}{-3}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) is the line \\(x=1+2s\\) ; \\(y=-4+s\\) ; \\(z=8-2s.\\) Solution. Line \\(L_{2}\\) is already in parametric form: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =1+2s &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =-4+s &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-2s &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] We now write \\(L_{1}\\) in parametric form. Set1 As \\(L_{2}\\) is using the parameter \\(s\\) we choose a parameter \\(t\\) in what follows. It doesn\u2019t matter what you use but it must be different from \\(s.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{y-1}{-1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{z-8}{-3} &amp; =t. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =5+t &amp; \\left(5\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =1-t &amp; \\left(6\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-3t &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\] To find the point of intersection of these two lines, we must find a point \\(P\\) that lies on both lines.  At the point of intersection the coordinates for \\(L_{1}\\) will equal the coordinates for \\(L_{2}\\). This means there exist values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) such that the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates of the two lines are equal. Equating the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates, we get from equations \\(\\left(2-7\\right):\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x,$ }5+t= &amp; 1+2s\\\\ 4= &amp; 2s-t &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $y,$ }1-t= &amp; -4+s\\\\ 5= &amp; s+t &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $z,$ }8-3t= &amp; 8-2s\\\\ 0= &amp; 3t-2s. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] If we add equations \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(9\\right)\\) we get \\(9=3s\\) and so \\(s=3\\). If \\(s=3\\) we can substitute this into all of the above equations \\(\\left(8-9\\right)\\) and find that \\(t=2\\). Note that you must check all equations. 2 You must check that \\(s=3\\) and \\(t=2\\) satisfies all three equations. It is common that they satisfy only \\(2\\) of the \\(3\\) equations as shown below in Example 2.  The solution is therefore \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =3\\\\ t &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] To find the point of intersection, substitute the \\(s\\) value into the \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{2}\\) or substitute the \\(t\\) value into \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{1}\\). For \\(L_{1},\\) \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =5+t\\\\ &amp; =5+2\\\\ &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =1-t\\\\ &amp; =1-2\\\\ &amp; =-1\\\\ z &amp; =8-3t\\\\ &amp; =8-3(2)\\\\ &amp; =2 \\end{align*}\\] Therefore the point of intersection of the two lines is \\((7,-1,2).\\)   Example 2 Do the lines \\(L_{1}:\\) \\(x=s\\) ; \\(y=-4+s\\) ; \\(z=8-2s\\) and \\(L_{2}:\\) \\(x=2+2t\\) ; \\(y=-1+t\\) ; \\(z=3-2t\\) intersect? Solution. Equate the coordinates of each line. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x,$ }s= &amp; 2+2t\\\\ s-2t= &amp; 2 &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $y,$ }-4+s= &amp; -1+t\\\\ s-t= &amp; 3 &amp; \\left(12\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $z,$ }8-2s= &amp; 3-2t\\\\ -2s+2t= &amp; -5. &amp; \\left(13\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Subtract equation \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) from equation \\(\\left(12\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} s-t-\\left(s-2t\\right) &amp; =3-2\\\\ t &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Substitute \\(t=1\\) in equation \\(\\left(11\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} s-2\\left(1\\right) &amp; =2\\\\ s &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] We have a solution namely, \\(t=1\\), \\(s=4\\) but this must be checked with all equations. The proposed solution satisfies equations \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and equation \\(\\left(12\\right)\\) but substituting in equation \\(\\left(13\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(4\\right)+2\\left(1\\right) &amp; =-5\\\\ -8+2 &amp; =-5\\\\ -6 &amp; =-5. \\end{align*}\\] The last statement is clearly untrue. Consequently, we conclude there is no solution for \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) and so the lines do not intersect. In this case, we say the lines are skew.    Exercise Find the point of intersection of the lines \\(x=2t+2\\) ; \\(y=2t+3\\) ; \\(z=t+3\\) and \\(\\frac{x+2}{2}=\\frac{y-2}{-1}=\\frac{z}{2}\\) Answer: \\(\\left(0,1,2\\right)\\)    Download this page: V7 Intersecting Lines (PDF 287KB)  What's next...

(See also Linear graphs) A plane is a subset of three dimensional space. In non mathematical terms you can think of it as a flat surface that extends infinitely in two directions. It may be defined as  the surface that goes through three points or the surface containing a point and having a fixed normal vector.   Cartesian Equation of a Plane  The above diagram represents a part of a plane. On the plane are two points, \\(P(x,y,z)\\) and \\(P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})\\) . The vector \\(\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}=(x-x_{0})\\hat{i}+(y-y_{0})\\hat{j}+(z-z_{0})\\hat{k}\\). Also illustrated is a normal vector to the plane (that is a vector at right angles to the plane) represented by \\(\\overrightarrow{N}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\), where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants. Since \\(\\overrightarrow{N}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}\\) their dot product must equal zero,1 The definition of the dot product of two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\). If \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) are perpendicular, \\(\\theta=90^{\\circ}\\). Hence \\(\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)=\\cos\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=0\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] that is to say \\(\\overrightarrow{N}.\\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}=0\\) therefore: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\right).\\left((x-x_{0})\\hat{i}+(y-y_{0})\\hat{j}+(z-z_{0})\\hat{k}\\right) &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] So \\[\\begin{align*} a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0}) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This equation defines the plane in Cartesian coordinates. This equation may be rearranged: \\[\\begin{align*} a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0}) &amp; =0\\\\ ax+by+cz &amp; =ax_{0}+by_{0}+cz_{0}\\\\ &amp; =d \\end{align*}\\] where \\(d\\) is a constant. In fact, the general equation of a plane with the normal vector \\(\\overrightarrow{N}=a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} ax+by+cz &amp; =d. \\end{align*}\\] For example, 1. \\(\\;2x-3y+z=6\\) is a plane. 2.\\(\\;x+y=4\\) is a plane. 3.\\(\\;z=x-2y+3\\) is a plane. To see this rearrange it to get the Cartesian form of the plane, \\(x-2y-z=-3\\).  Example 1 If a plane has the normal vector \\(\\overrightarrow{N}=\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}-5\\hat{k}\\) and contains the point \\((3,4,1)\\) then we can say that the equation of the plane is: \\[\\begin{align*} 1(x-3)+2(y-4)-5(z-1) &amp; =0\\\\ x-3+2y-8-5z+5 &amp; =0\\\\ x+2y-5z &amp; =3+8-5\\\\ x+2y-5z &amp; =6 \\end{align*}\\] Compare this equation with the normal vector, \\(\\overrightarrow{N}\\). You will notice that the coefficients of \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\hat{j}\\) and \\(\\hat{k}\\) for the normal vector are the same as the coefficients of \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) in the equation of the plane.   Example 2 Find the equation of the plane normal to the vector \\(6\\hat{i}-5\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}\\) that passes through the point \\((1,2,3)\\). The equation of the plane will be 2 Obviously there are an infinite number of parallel planes that are perpendicular to the given vector. For instance \\(6x-5y+z=-1\\) , \\(6x-5y+z=0\\) , \\(6x-5y+z=6\\) , \\(6x-5y+z=11\\) etc. are all perpendicular to the vector \\(6\\hat{i}-5\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}\\) but only one of these, \\(6x-5y+z=-1\\) , will pass through the given point. \\[\\begin{align*} 6(x-1)-5(y-2)+1(z-3) &amp; =0\\\\ 6x-6-5y+10+z-3 &amp; =0\\\\ 6x-5y+z &amp; =6-10+3\\\\ 6x-5y+z &amp; =-1 \\end{align*}\\] Not only can we find the equation of a plane, given a point and a normal vector, but we can also find the equation of the normal vector given the equation of a plane. For example the plane \\(3x+4y-z=9\\) has a normal vector \\(\\overrightarrow{N}=3\\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}-\\hat{k}\\).   Example 3 Find the equation of the plane that passes through the point \\((2,1,-5)\\) and is parallel to the plane \\(z=2x+3y-4\\) . Since the plane is parallel to \\(z=2x+3y-4\\) , it will have the same normal vector. The equation \\(z=2x+3y-4\\) can be written as \\(2x+3y-z=4\\) , therefore its normal vector will be \\(2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}-\\hat{k}\\) . So the equation of the plane we wish to find will pass through the point \\((2,1,-5)\\) and have a normal vector \\(2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}-\\hat{k}\\) . \\[\\begin{align*} 2(x-2)+3(y-1)-1(z+5) &amp; =0\\\\ 2x-4+3y-3-z-5 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x+3y-z &amp; =4+3+5\\\\ 2x+3y-z &amp; =12 \\end{align*}\\]   Example 4 Find the equation of the plane that contains the three points \\(A(1,1,1)\\) , \\(B(2,4,3)\\) and \\(C(3,2,1)\\) . First find the cross product of the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\) as this will give a vector normal to the plane.

Where they slice will be defined by a straight line. There will also be an angle between the two planes. Learn how to determine the angle between two intersecting planes and the equation of the line of intersection.  (See also Linear graphs)  Introduction When two planes in three dimensions intersect, the set of points in the intersection forms a line. However two planes do not form lines if they are parallel and hence never intersect. This module considers the angle between two planes when they are not parallel.   Definition of a Plane A plane in three dimensions is a set of points satisfying the equation \\[\\begin{align*} ax+by+cz &amp; =d \\end{align*}\\] where \\(a,\\,b,\\,c\\) and \\(d\\) are constants.   Normal to a Plane The normal \\(\\vec{N}\\), of a plane \\[\\begin{align*} ax+by+cz &amp; =d \\end{align*}\\] is a vector at right angles to the plane and has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{N} &amp; =a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j}+c\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\] Of course, another normal is given by \\(-\\vec{N}=-a\\hat{i}-b\\hat{j}-c\\hat{k}\\) as this just a vecor in the opposite direction of \\(\\vec{N}\\) and is still at right angles to the plane.   The Angle Between Two Planes The angle between two intersecting planes is the same as the angle between the normals of the planes. If \\(N_{1}\\) and \\(N_{2}\\)are the normals of two intersecting planes, we know that1 This follows from the definition of the dot or scalar product. \\[\\begin{align*} \\overrightarrow{N_{1}}.\\overrightarrow{N_{2}} &amp; =\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}\\right|\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between them. Rearranging , we find : \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}.\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}\\right|\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that there are in general two possible angles. One is obtuse, the other is acute. Together they sum to \\(180^{\\circ}.\\) If we wish to find only the acute angle between the planes then we say that: \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}.\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}\\right|\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|} \\end{align*}\\]  Example Find the acute angle of intersection of the planes \\(x+y+z=0\\) and \\(x-3y+z=1\\). The plane \\(x+y+z=0\\) has the normal vector \\(\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}=\\overrightarrow{i}+\\overrightarrow{j}+\\overrightarrow{k}\\). The plane \\(x-3y+z=1\\) has the normal vector \\(\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}=\\overrightarrow{i}-3\\overrightarrow{j}+\\overrightarrow{k}.\\) Remember: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}.\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}\\right|\\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right|} \\end{alignat*}\\] so: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}.\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\left(1\\times1\\right)+\\left(1\\times-3\\right)+\\left(1\\times1\\right)\\right|\\\\ &amp; =\\left|-1\\right|\\\\ &amp; =1 \\end{alignat*}\\] and: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{1}}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3} \\end{alignat*}\\] and: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\overrightarrow{N_{2}}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{1^{2}+3^{2}+1^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{11} \\end{alignat*}\\] Therefore: \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{11}}\\simeq0.1741 \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging formula and using inverse \\(\\cos\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(0.1741\\right)\\simeq80^{o} \\end{align*}\\] So the angle of intersection of the two planes is approximately \\(80\\) degrees.   Exercise Find the angle of intersection of the following planes  The plane \\(x-y+z=1\\) and \\(2x+y-z=3\\) Answer: \\(90\\) degrees. The plane \\(2x+y-z=2\\) and \\(3x+y-z=3\\) Answer: \\(10\\) degrees.     Line of Intersection of Two Planes The planes, \\(P_{1}\\)and \\(P_{2}\\) intersect along the line L, as in the diagram below:  We want to find the equation of the line of intersection, \\(L.\\)  Example If \\(P_{1}\\): \\(2x+4y-z=4\\) and \\(P_{2}\\): \\(x-2y+z=3\\) , find the parametric equations of the line of intersection of the two planes. Solution: Given \\(2x+4y-z=4\\) and \\(x-2y+z=3\\), we have two equations but three unknowns. This is a clue to introduce a parameter.2 We will set \\(z=t\\) but you can set \\(x=t\\) or \\(y=t\\). This will generate a set of equations that may look different to what we show below, but they are correct. Let \\(z=t\\) then the equations of the planes become \\[\\begin{alignat*}{2} 2x+4y-t &amp; =4 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ x-2y+t &amp; =3. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{alignat*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) by \\(-2\\), the equations become: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} 2x+4y-t &amp; =4\\\\ -2x+4y-2t &amp; =-6 \\end{alignat*}\\] adding these two equations we get: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} 8y-3t &amp; =-2\\\\ 8y &amp; =3t-2\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{3}{8}t-\\frac{1}{4}. \\end{alignat*}\\] Substituting \\(y\\) in equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} x-2\\left(\\frac{3}{8}t-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+t &amp; =3\\\\ x-\\frac{6}{8}t+\\frac{2}{4}+t &amp; =3\\\\ x+\\frac{1}{4}t+\\frac{1}{2} &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =3-\\frac{1}{4}t-\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}t. \\end{alignat*}\\] Hence the parametric equations of the line of the intersection of the two planes are: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} x=\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}t,\\,y &amp; =\\frac{3}{8}t-\\frac{1}{4}\\text{ and $z=t.$ } \\end{alignat*}\\]   Exercise Find the parametric line of intersection and the angle of intersection of the planes \\(x+y+2z=0\\) and \\(2x-y+z=5\\). Answer: Line is \\(x=2-t\\) ; \\(y=-1-t\\) ; \\(z=t\\). Angle is \\(60\\)degrees.     Download this page: V9 Intersecting Planes (PDF 133KB)  What's next...

Learn how to find the perpendicular (right angle) distance from a point to a plane. What do we mean when we talk about distance from a point to a plane? Consider the figure below. Here the \\(x-\\)axis is in red, the \\(y-\\)axis is in green and the \\(z-\\)axis is in blue. The grey plane is the \\(x-y\\) plane, it extends in all directions. The aqua plane also extends in all directions.  You can have any number of distances from a point \\(A\\) to the aqua colored plane. For example, the distance from point \\(A\\) to point \\(P\\) is one possible answer while the distance from point \\(A\\) to point \\(P1\\) is another. This makes no sense. The only interpretation of the question that provides a unique answer is \u201cFind the shortest distance from a point to a plane\u201d. This means we want to find the perpendicular distance from the point to the plane. When you are asked to find the distance from a point to a plane, you must find the shortest distance from a point to the plane.  Shortest Distance from a Point to a Plane Consider the figure below. Here, the axes are exactly the same as the figure above. To find the shortest distance from a point \\(A\\) to the aqua colored plane we first choose any point on the plane \\(P\\) as shown below. Now define a vector from \\(P\\) to \\(A\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{PA}\\). The shortest distance \\(d\\) is then1 This is sometimes called the scalar resolute of \\(\\overrightarrow{PA}\\) in the direction of \\(\\hat{n}\\). Since the unit vector \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{n} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{n}}{\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|} \\end{align*}\\] we can express the distance as \\[\\begin{align*} d= &amp; \\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\hat{n}\\\\ = &amp; \\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{n}}{\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} d &amp; =\\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\hat{n} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{n}\\) is a unit normal to the plane.  This may be easier to understand if we rotate the picture above so that we view the aqua plane \u201cedge on\u201d as shown below.2 Note that if we take this viewpoint, the distance \\(d\\) does not change as we rotate the plane about the unit normal vector. This means the perpendicular distance \\(d\\) does not depend on how you view the problem.   The distance \\(d\\) is often referred to as the scalar resolute of \\(\\overrightarrow{PA}\\) in the direction of \\(\\vec{n}.\\)  Unit Normal to a Plane To get the distance from a plane to a point, we need to get a unit normal to the plane. For a plane \\[\\begin{align*} ax+by+cz &amp; =d \\end{align*}\\] a normal vector is \\(a\\hat{i}+b\\hat{j+}c\\hat{k}.\\) For example, the plane \\[\\begin{align*} 2x+3y-6z &amp; =20 \\end{align*}\\] has a normal \\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{n} &amp; =2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\] To create a unit normal \\(\\hat{n}\\) we divide the normal \\(\\vec{n}\\) by it\u2019s length \\(\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|\\), 3 The length of a vector \\(\\vec{n}=n_{1}\\hat{i}+n_{2}\\hat{j}+n_{3}\\hat{k}\\) is denoted \\(\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|\\) and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\vec{n}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\vec{n}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}+\\left(-6\\right)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{49}\\\\ &amp; =7. \\end{align*}\\] So a unit normal to the plane is \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{n} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{n}}{\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{7}\\left(2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}-6\\hat{k}\\right) \\end{align*}\\]    Example Find the distance from the point \\(\\left(2,5,4\\right)\\) to the plane \\(x+2y+2z=2.\\) Solution: Let point \\(A=\\left(2,5,4\\right)\\). Now find a point on the plane.4 It can be ANY point. So to make it easy, we can take \\(y=z=0.\\) Substituting in the equation for the plane we get \\(x=2.\\) So the point \\(P=\\left(2,0,0\\right)\\) is on the plane. We take \\(P=\\left(2,0,0\\right)\\). The vector from \\(P\\) to \\(A\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} \\overrightarrow{PA} &amp; =2\\hat{i}+5\\hat{j}+4\\hat{k}-\\left(2\\hat{i}+0\\hat{j}+0\\hat{k}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\hat{j}+4\\hat{k}. \\end{align*}\\] We now need to find a unit vector that is normal to the plane.

So the directional derivative is the gradient in a particular direction.   (See also Linear graphs)  Learn how to find the directional derivative of a function of two variables f(x,y) or three variables g(x,y,z) at a point and in a given direction. This is very useful in engineering and especially computer graphics.  You will recall that the derivative of a function gives us the gradient or rate of change of the function. The rate of change of a function such as \\(z=f\\left(x,y\\right)\\) can be found by \\(\\text{partial}\\) differentiation; \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) gives the rate of change of the function \\(f\\), with respect to \\(x\\), that is, the gradient of the graph as we move in the \\(x\\) direction. Keep in mind that the graph of \\(z=f\\left(x,y\\right)\\) is a surface in three dimensional space and \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\) gives the rate of change of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(y\\), that is, the gradient of the graph as we move in the \\(y\\) direction.  Directional Derivatives We can find the rate of change of a function in any direction (not just in the direction of the \\(x-\\) axis or \\(y-\\) axis) by finding the directional derivative. The directional derivative of a function \\(f\\) in the direction of a vector \\(\\vec{u}\\) is denoted by \\(D_{u}\\) and is given by:1 Note that the function \\(f\\) may be of \\(2\\) or more variables. \\[\\begin{align*} D_{u} &amp; =\\nabla f\\cdot\\hat{u} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{u}\\) is a unit vector in the direction of the vector \\(\\vec{u}.\\)2 A unit vector is a vector of magnitude \\(1.\\) For a vector \\(\\vec{u}\\) a unit vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{u}\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{u} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\left|\\vec{u}\\right|}\\vec{u} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\left|\\vec{u}\\right|\\) is the magnitude of the vector \\(\\vec{u}\\). The following figure illustrates the meaning of the directional derivative:   Example 1 Suppose that we wish to find the directional derivative of \\(f\\left(x,y\\right)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at the point \\(\\left(2,3\\right)\\) in the direction of the vector \\(\\vec{u}=4\\vec{i}-3\\vec{j}\\). Solution The first step is to find the vector \u201cgrad f\u201d, symbolised thus \\(\\nabla f\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\vec{i} &amp; +\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\vec{j}. \\end{align*}\\] In this particular case \\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f &amp; =2x\\vec{i}+2y\\vec{j}\\\\ &amp; =4\\vec{i}+6\\vec{j} \\end{align*}\\] at the point where \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=3\\) . The next step is to find the dot product of this vector \\(\\nabla f\\), and \\(\\hat{u}\\), the unit vector in the direction of \\(\\vec{u}\\). In this case \\(\\vec{u}=4i-3j\\), therefore \\(\\hat{u}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left(4i-3j\\right)\\) Hence the directional derivative of \\(f\\) in the direction of \\(u\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} D_{u} &amp; =\\left(4i+6j\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{5}i-\\frac{3}{5}j\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{16}{5}-\\frac{18}{5}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2}{5}. \\end{align*}\\] To generalise the above, the directional derivative of a function, \\(f\\), in the direction of \\(u\\) is \\[ D_{u}=\\nabla f\\cdot\\hat{u} \\] where \\[ \\nabla f=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}i+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}j+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}k. \\] Since the directional derivative relies on a dot product, (remember \\(\\vec{a}.\\vec{b}=\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|\\left|\\vec{b}\\right|\\cos\\theta\\)), it will be a maximum when \\(\\cos\\theta\\) is maximum (that is, \\(\\cos\\theta=1\\)), so the directional derivative will be maximum when \\(\\theta=0\\). In other words, we can say that  \\(D_{u}\\) will be maximum when \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are in the same direction. \\(D_{u}\\) will have its greatest negative value when \\(u\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are in opposite directions (when \\(\\theta=\\pi\\)). \\(D_{u}\\) will be zero when \\(u\\) and \\(\\nabla f\\) are at right angles.    Example 2 If \\(f\\left(x,y,z\\right)=x^{2}+y^{2}+xyz\\), find a unit vector \\(\\hat{u}\\) such that the rate of change of \\(f\\) at \\(\\left(2,3,-1\\right)\\) in the direction of \\(u\\) is maximum. Solution \\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f= &amp; \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\hat{i}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}\\\\ = &amp; \\left(2x+yz\\right)\\hat{i}+\\left(2y+xz\\right)\\hat{j}+\\left(xy\\right)\\hat{k}\\\\ = &amp; \\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k} \\end{align*}\\] For the directional derivative to be maximum, \\(u=\\nabla f\\) Therefore \\(u=\\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k}\\) and \\(\\hat{u}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{53}}\\left(\\hat{i}+4\\hat{j}+6\\hat{k}\\right)\\).

The differences between reports occur chiefly in the body. Reports follow a principle of moving from a problem or issue through to solutions. The structure (headings, sub-headings) needs to be tailored to fit the context (rather than vice versa). Your lecturer may provide a structure by giving headings or questions to answer. Follow the instructions of your teacher first. You need to determine the most logical and efficient way to:  chunk the information order the information label the information using headings or subheadings.  Reports vary in style and purpose but the following sections are common to most reports. The sections described below should be used as a guide and are not prescriptive.    Beginning Title page Abstract or executive summary Table of contents Introduction Middle (body) Method\/methodology Results Discussion End Conclusion Recommendations References Appendices     Beginning Your report should start by setting the context for the body of the report. It is the section where the reader is informed of what they need to know to understand the rest of the report. Title page This includes:  the title of report your name date.  Tip: Microsoft Word can help you generate title pages.   Abstract or executive Summary In 5-10% of the total word count, give an overview of the entire report. Identify:  the purpose [1] of the report the methods [2] used to conduct the research the result [3] of the research the conclusions [4] drawn from the research recommendations [5] for future actions.  Sample executive summary  [1] The study is a quantitative investigation of university graduates' awareness of social media [SM] use in the recruitment process. [2] Likert-scaled questionnaires were emailed to randomly selected students approaching the end of their course in three departments of the university. [3] The results showed that most students did not agree with the proposition that various social media platforms were used for screening. [4] This indicates a significant underestimation of how prevalent SM is as a recruitment and screening tool despite the prevalence SM has in the lives of the cohort sample. [5] It was recommended that explicit awareness raising be integrated into Careers &amp; Employment communications and professionally oriented courses.

Sample introduction  [1] There has been an increase in the use of social media over recent years in the recruitment and job-seeking process with every indication that this practice will continue to expand. Social media has become a tool for potential employers to gather information and evaluate a candidate's suitability for a job. While this practice has become widespread, there is little in the way of systematic approaches to using social media as a recruitment tool. Expectations about social media presence are seldom explicit, and both potential employers and employees need clarity on appropriate use of this information. [2] This report will discuss research into graduating students awareness of social media usage as a recruitment tool for graduate employment.    Middle (body) Organise the sections in a logical sequence based on:  how you investigated the issue or problem (method, methodology, materials, participants, length of study time) what you found through the investigation, (results) what judgements\/ interpretations you have made about the process or the findings (discussion, analysis)  Method\/methodology The method section of a report details how the research was conducted, the research methods used and the reasons for choosing those methods. It should:  outline the participants and research methods used, e.g. surveys\/questionnaire, interviews refer to other relevant studies.  The methodology is a step-by-step explanation of the research process. It should be:  factual mainly written in past tense.  The method section of a scientific\/engineering report provides:  an explanation of the experimental procedures (so that the experiment can be repeated for validation in the future). mainly written in passive tense.  Sample methodology   Use the buttons to explore the sample methodology.  The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009). This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated graduates attitudes and knowledge of the use of social media in recruitment (see Appendix 1). The questionnaire used a 4-point Likert scale to assess awareness (Jones 2007) and attitudes towards social media in recruitment and provided open-ended responses for additional comments. The survey was voluntary and anonymous. A total of 412 questionnaires were distributed online to randomly selected graduating students from each of the three colleges within the university. The completed questionnaires were returned by email.  methodprocedurerelevant studyparticipantsShow all    The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:  What happened? What was found?  There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts. Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section. Presenting the data Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to explain or illustrate a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but is supportive, then it can be an appendix to the report but still referred to within the text. Dot points\/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information. Sample results There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.

It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues\/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:  state\/identify the main research findings\/themes interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean link the results to other research.  Identifying the major themes in the results will help structure the discussion. This will keep the report focussed on specific points that have developed from the data or research. This helps to clarify identifiable outcomes which can often be used as headings. Sample discussion  This study highlights the lack of awareness amongst graduate job seekers of the use of social media for recruitment. The practice of employers accessing the personal profiles of potential employees is widespread and is not considered to be an ethical issue by employers. As the data (Smith &amp; Watson, 2014) demonstrates, over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% check Facebook and Twitter when considering candidates who have applied for positions. Further, Starr's (2015) research of school leavers indicates that less than 25% are aware of what privacy settings they use on social media and even fewer were aware that these sites may be used for judging people for various reasons (see Appendix 2). Clearly. the job seeking public needs to be made aware that employers are increasingly accessing their personal profiles on social media for recruitment purposes. Educating the public on the consequences of this recruitment practice needs to start early.  discussion of results link to other research student analysis\/ comments     End Reports are often about solving problems or exploring issues. The end of the report should give the reader a sense of outcome and future direction after the body. Conclusion This is a summary statement of key findings or outcomes. Have your aims been successful or not? Was your hypothesis proven to be true? A synthesis and interpretation of findings makes them meaningful for the reader. Sample conclusion  Usage of social media in recruitment is widely established and expected to increase as social media becomes further integrated with business and personal lifestyles. Current research has found that over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% engage with Facebook and Twitter when making decisions about the appropriateness of prospective employees. However results show that graduates were sufficiently aware or alarmed by this practice and the potential discriminatory effect on their employment opportunities.  synthesis and interpretation     Recommendations A good way to present your recommendations is to list them in bullet points for easy reading. What actions do you suggest, given your conclusions? What questions for further study are raised by this research or investigation? Sample recommendations   There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.   Awareness of these issues should be introduced in the early years of a course. This would allow students to cultivate career appropriate social media profiles and practices before these issues become crucial.     References This is a list of all the sources referred to in the report. This should be on a separate page and should be done in accordance with the referencing style chosen by your school. Author date systems list the references in alphabetical order of the first author's surname. Footnoting styles list them in order of their appearance in the report.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.    .nav-stacked {float:left; width: 30%;} .tab-content {float:left; width: 60%;} .clear {clear: both;} ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1543 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Home Profile Messages Settings home profile messages What is Lorem Ipsum?

Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point.  A derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.  (See also Functions and graphs)   Gradient of a Curve In this module we are concerned with finding a formula for the slope or gradient of the tangent at any point on a given curve \\(y\\)=\\(f(x)\\).  The formula \\(m=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\) may be used to find the gradient of a line when two points on the line, \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right)\\) are known.1 There are two special cases that have to be dealt with: horizontal and vertical lines. A horizontal line parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis with equation of the form \\(y=k\\) where \\(k\\) is a constant, has a gradient of zero. As a line becomes closer to vertical its gradient gets larger. A vertical line parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis with equation of the form \\(x=c\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant has a gradient which is undefined. Consider the gradient of the curve defined by \\(y=f(x)\\) at the point P (ie the gradient of the tangent line AB).  This gradient cannot be calculated as only one point (the point \\(P\\)) on the line is known. But the point \\(P\\) has coordinates \\(\\left(x,f(x)\\right)\\)and the point \\(Q\\) has coordinates \\(\\left(x+h,f(x+h)\\right)\\). The gradient of the line \\(PQ\\) can be calculated and this can be used to approximate the gradient of \\(AB\\). The gradient of \\(PQ\\) = \\(\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\). As the value of \\(h\\) decreases (i.e \\(Q\\) becomes closer to the point \\(P\\)), the approximation of the gradient is more accurate. The value of the gradient becomes most accurate as \\(h\\) approaches zero. The gradient formula for the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) is defined as the derivative function \\[ f'(x)=\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},h\\text{$\\neq$ }0. \\] The derivative function\\(f'(x)\\) gives the slope of the tangent to the curve\\(f(x)\\) at any point x.   Example The derivative of the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{3}{x}\\) is \\(f'(x)=-\\frac{3}{x^{2}}\\). Find the slope of the tangent to the curve at \\(x=4\\). Solution At \\(x\\) = 4, \\[\\begin{align*} f'(x) &amp; =-\\frac{3}{4^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{3}{16}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the slope of the tangent at \\(x=4\\) is \\(-\\frac{3}{16}\\,.\\)   Exercises  If the derivative function for \\(f(x)=x^{3}-x\\) is \\(f'(x)=3x^{2}-1\\), find the slope of the tangent to this curve at \\(\\quad\\text{a) }x=2\\quad\\text{b) $x=0\\quad\\text{c) $x=-9$ .}$ }\\)    If the derivative function of \\(f(x)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is \\(f'(x)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) find the gradient of \\(f(x)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) at \\(\\quad\\text{a) }x=0\\quad\\text{b) $x=\\pi\/2\\quad\\text{c) $x=3.5\\,$ .}$ }\\)    Determine \\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{(x+h)^{2}-x^{2}}{h}\\) and hence find the slope of the tangent to the curve \\(y=x^{2}\\) at \\(\\quad\\text{a) }x=2\\quad\\text{b) $x=0\\quad\\text{c) $x=-9\\,$ .}$ }\\)     Download this page, D2 Gradients, tangents and derivatives (PDF 273KB)  What's next...

The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent.\n\nKeywords(tags): Differentiation, Maths\n\n\n\n   How do you find the maximum (highest) or minimum (lowest) value of a curve? The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent. If you go looking for the horizontal tangents (i.e. where the derivative = 0), you will be able to pinpoint the maxima or minima of a curve.  Using calculus we can find the derivative of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and use this to find maximum and minimum values of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and the values of \\(x\\) where they occur. We can therefore use calculus to solve problems that involve maximizing or minimizing functions.  Definition The maximum or minimum values of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) occur when the derivative \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\]  Second Derivative Test. Let \\(x\\) satisfy \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) then if \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\"}\\left(x\\right) &amp; \\begin{cases} =0,\\text{ $x$ is an inflection point}\\\\ &lt;0\\text{, $f\\left(x\\right)$ is a local maximum}\\\\ &gt;0\\text{, $f\\left(x\\right)$ is a local minimum.} \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\]    Example 1 The distance \\(s\\,km,\\) to the nearest \\(km\\), of a fishing boat from port at any time, \\(t\\) hours, is given by the formula \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =2+8t-2.5t^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] When is the boat furthest from port and what is its distance from the port at that time? Solution For a maximum or minimum, \\(ds\/dt=0.\\) That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{ds}{dt} &amp; =8-5t\\\\ &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] So, \\[\\begin{align*} 8-5t &amp; =0\\\\ 5t &amp; =8\\\\ t &amp; =1.6\\text{ hours.} \\end{align*}\\] Now this could be a maximum or minimum distance. However, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}s}{dt^{2}} &amp; =-5\\\\ &amp; &lt;0. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(t=1.6\\) is a maximum. When \\(t=1.6\\) hours, the distance from port, \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =2+8(1.6)-2.5\\left(1.6\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =8.4\\,km. \\end{align*}\\] The boat is furthest from port after \\(1.6\\) hours and the distance from port, at that time, is \\(8.4\\,km\\).   Example 2 Find the maximum product of two numbers that have a sum of \\(10.\\) Solution Let the numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} a+b &amp; =10. &amp; \\left(2.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Let the product of the two numbers be \\(P\\) so \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =a\\times b. \\end{align*}\\] From \\(\\left(2.1\\right)\\)1 We need to get \\(P\\) in terms of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) so that we take a derivative like \\(dP\/da\\) or \\(dP\/db\\). In this case we write \\(P\\) as a function of \\(b\\) but identical results are obtained is we make \\(P\\) a function of \\(a.\\)  \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =10-b \\end{align*}\\] so \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =\\left(10-b\\right)b\\\\ &amp; =10b-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dP}{db} &amp; =10-2b. \\end{align*}\\] For a maximum or minimum, \\(dP\/db=0,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 10-2b &amp; =0\\\\ 2b &amp; =10\\\\ b &amp; =5. &amp; \\left(2.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] But \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}P}{db^{2}} &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; &lt;0 \\end{align*}\\] and we have a maximum. Substituting \\(b=5\\) in \\(\\left(2.1\\right)\\) we find \\(a=5.\\) Hence the two numbers adding to \\(10\\) and having a maximal product are \\(a=b=5\\) and the maximum product is \\(25.\\)   Example 3 Find the minimum value of the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-5x+6\\). Solution We have \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2x-5. &amp; \\left(3.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] For a maximum or minimum we know \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 2x-5 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x &amp; =5\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{5}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Since \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\"}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2\\\\ &amp; &gt;0 \\end{align*}\\] for all values of \\(x\\) we know we have a minimum. Hence the minimum value of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-5x+6\\) occurs at \\(5\/2.\\) The minimum value of the function is \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-5\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)+6\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{2}+\\frac{12}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{50}{4}+\\frac{24}{4}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{4}. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises  Find two positive numbers whose sum is 18 such that the sum of their squares is a minimum.

It would suit any student studying at a certificate, diploma or degree level and is designed to help with developing essay and report preparation and writing skills. Introduction: Analysing an argument in a text The very first thing to do when beginning an analysis is to put away your biases (at least as much as you can). It doesn't really matter what you think about the issue or the argument; in fact, you may disagree entirely, or may agree entirely with the argument. You should put that aside. When all you can think about is your own perspective on an argument, you blind yourself to the actual argument before you. The second thing you need to do when beginning an analysis is to actually observe what is on the page. In analysing an argument in a text, the reader looks for the key argument. This argument may be at the beginning or even towards the end. In many cases, the article is a response to an argument put forward by someone else. The writer of the article you are reading may be making counterclaims to rebut the first writer's argument.   Knowing about the writer can help your analysis. Ask questions, such as, what is the writer's purpose, allegiances (political or professional) industry? Showing at least two sides to an argument demonstrates that the writer has considered different views. They may still favour one side and rebut certain views with counter-arguments. A writer will further strengthen their counter-arguments by giving evidence with referenced citations.  In this tutorial  Steps to analysing an argument. What do you look for when you are undertaking a critical analysis. Time to complete 30 minutes. Elements of an argument. What are the parts of an argument called and what do they do?

In fact, it was not until 1833 that people began calling themselves \"scientists\". Before that time, people studied natural philosophy, the study of nature, causes, astrology and many more subjects. Astrology, medicine, magic, and experiments were used in alchemy to understand the world and to create new substances. What we now think of as science came from natural philosophy and alchemy.   Photo by Joanna Kosinska on  Unsplash Turning lead to gold Alchemy was the art of attempting to transmute or to change metals, particularly lead, into gold. For many thousands of years, alchemists had tried to unlock the secrets of matter, to bring great wealth and create a cure for all diseases. Alchemists believed that by studying the stars, metals, herbs and other substances, they could find a way to create the philosopher's stone. The philosopher's stone was believed to cure all disease, turn metals to gold and make people immortal. For over four thousand years and across many countries, alchemy was practised by people who believed that matter could be classified and understood through experiments. We can describe alchemy as the start of the system of modern science in many parts of the world. Of the modern sciences, chemistry is the closest to alchemy in name and in practice. Classifying matter into different elements, states and categories was an alchemical pursuit. The alchemical table   You may recognise some of the elements included on the alchemical table. Some of the metals named here are still very much a part of modern science and our understanding of matter. Other components, such as the four elements, are no longer part of scientific beliefs. Chemistry is born Robert Boyle published \"The Sceptical Chymist\" at the end of the 17th century. This book disproved the idea that matter was made of a mix of some or all of the four elements; earth, fire, air and wind. Instead, Boyle used new equipment and experiments to prove his theories about the world. This emphasis on experiments that could be repeated anywhere and give the same results was not new, but Boyle helped to set the standards for the modern chemist. In the 19th century, the scientific method and the separation of the sciences into specific disciplines became the hallmarks of modern science.","excerpt":"nodeID: 1512 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Isaac Newton would not have said he was a scientist, but he would have said he was an alchemist, or some who practised alchemy.

To understand the natural world, you need chemistry. From DNA to space flight, virtually all parts of science and technology have a chemistry component. Studying chemistry will help you to understand the building blocks of all matter in the universe. Learning how elements interact with each other and create everything we can see, is covered by chemistry. Predicting how an acid will react when you add a base will save your cakes in food technology, keep your cleaning products active in industrial chemistry, and get the ph. of your fertiliser just right.  Modern agriculture and farming could not exist without chemistry. All plants need sunlight and water, and today we know that plants also need a mix of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorous to grow. Knowing which elements plants need to grow is vital to creating large farms that can feed today's populations.  As well as knowing which chemicals are needed for farming, we need to know where to find supplies of these elements, or how to make them. Modern life depends on creating nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus, to grow the plants we need to feed ourselves, not just the fruits and vegetables we enjoy but also the feed for dairy, chickens, and other farm animals. Careers with chemistry Atoms and elements are the foundations of chemistry, and chemistry is the foundation of many careers. Chemistry is also needed to succeed in; health and medicine, all the different fields of engineering, food technology, textiles, construction, architecture, geology, aeronautics, design, archaeology and so much more. Understanding chemistry is vital to many science subjects and STEM careers. ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1515 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Why study chemistry?

The language style of your statement should support your creative practice and the purpose of your statement. Avoid using theory or use jargon which might alienate your audience. You can write about your personal experiences if they relate to your creative work. You can tell a story or be playful, use humour or emotion if it relates to your personal style and your creative work. However, an artist statement for your social media platforms may need a different tone to one you write for a grant proposal. Writing a very short artist statement (50-100 words) can be the most challenging task because you must communicate your creative work to your audience in an engaging way, with the least words possible. See Artist statement - examples in the previous section, which include some very short artist statements. View this tutorial on writing an artist statement and an artist biography.    Learning activity     Writing an artist statement - tutorial This tutorial outlines an approach to writing an artist statement. It is based on textile design but can be easily adapted to suit other mediums.&nbsp;It describes the steps to identifying the key components of the statement and then shows how to write it.

Here are some vocabulary tips to help you through your writing process and two short quizzes at the end to test your knowledge:      DO use 'active' verbs to make your text more concise and engaging. Active or Action verbs are more persuasive and easier for your reader to understand. For example: a sentence with the verb 'to do' in the active voice would be, 'I will do my shopping on Wednesday.' Instead of a passive voice, 'On Wednesday, the shopping will be done by me.' (See this Learning Lab page for more information on using verbs for concise and engaging writing: Use verbs instead of abstract nouns)  &nbsp;  DO use the present tense &ndash; your statement is about what you're creating now, not your past. (See this Learning Lab page for more information: Use clear and concise language)  &nbsp;  DO use the first person if you want to &ndash; you don't have to write in the third person. It's OK to say \"I\" and \"me\" in your statement &ndash; it can be a more direct way of talking to your audience.  &nbsp;  DO use language that your audience can understand.      DON'T write long and complex sentences or paragraphs &ndash; break it up into smaller parts. (See this Learning Lab page for more information: Short and simple sentences)  &nbsp;  DON'T use \"art speak\"&nbsp;- try to avoid using pretentious or obscure language when discussing your work.  &nbsp;  DON'T brag or make false claims about your work &ndash; be honest.  &nbsp;  DON'T use hyperbole (overstatement) &ndash; \"a ground-breaking technique\" and avoid clich\u00e9s (overused phrases) &ndash; \"my work challenges the viewer&hellip;\"        Vocabulary quizzes - select the missing words in these real artist statements   Artist statement - quiz 1 Carly Fischer Exhibition: From Little Things Big Things Grow Start the quiz Transcript (RTF) &nbsp;&nbsp;    Artist statement - quiz 2 Peter Westwood General art practice statement Start the quiz Transcript (RTF) &nbsp;&nbsp;        Explore these skills in a real world context  Writing an artist statement  ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1485 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Here are some vocabulary tips to help you through your writing process and two short quizzes at the end to test your vocabulary knowledge.

Although there must be some minimum amount of cohesiveness if the team is going to continue to function as a team, Allen (2017, p. 48) states that highly cohesive teams 'are more motivated and effective in attaining goals when they have set these for themselves', and thus, achieve higher levels of member satisfaction.3Screen reader users, this is the evidence section.

For example:  A batch may be selected in a factory production process to assess how the process is operating. Surveys of consumers are used to determine the preferred brands in the population. Polls are conducted on samples of the voting population before elections to predict the result of the election.    Confidence Intervals Together with our estimate of the population parameter it is often helpful to provide a confidence interval.

The average weight of Australian men is the same as it was in \\(1990\\). Students from private schools have the same mean ATAR score as the Victorian average. The mean winter rainfall for the last \\(10\\) years is the same as the historical mean.  Our confidence about the probabilities of values drawn from normally distributed populations and sampling distributions enables us to formally test hypotheses (or claims) such as these. When we perform an \u2018experiment\u2019 we know there will be chance variation. For example, if we toss a supposedly fair coin \\(100\\) times we would not be surprised to obtain \\(48\\) or \\(45\\) or perhaps even \\(40\\) heads. However we would be surprised to obtain only \\(5\\) heads. If we were testing a coin for \u2018fairness\u2019 we might decide beforehand what we would consider a reasonable number of heads. In hypothesis testing \u2018reasonable\u2019 is defined as what we could expect \\(95\\)% (or \\(99\\)% or \\(90\\)% etc) of the time. In a hypothesis test we are concerned to assess how unusual our result is, whether it is reasonable chance variation (obtaining \\(45\\) heads in \\(100\\) tosses of a coin) or whether the result is too extreme to be considered chance variation (obtaining \\(5\\) heads in \\(100\\) tosses of a coin). A hypothesis test formalizes the process of deciding whether a result is reasonable.   Steps in a Hypothesis Test The steps are:  State the null and alternative hypotheses \\(H_{o}:\\) \\(\\overline{x}=\\mu\\) (the sample mean is the same as the population mean after allowing for chance variation) \\(H_{a}:\\overline{x}\\neq\\mu\\) (the sample mean is not the same as the population mean after allowing for chance variation) Significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is chosen (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\Rightarrow\\) we are defining reasonable as what we can expect 95% of the time) Critical values Tables or a calculator or a computer are used to find the z-values that corresponds to the chosen significance level. These are called the critical values.    Calculate the test statistic. This is the standardised difference between the sample mean (calculated from the given data) and the known population mean: \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{\\overline{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}. \\end{align*}\\] Decision: Is the result reasonable if \\(H_{o}\\) is true? Is the test statistic more extreme than the critical value? Yes \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Reject \\(H_{o},\\) No \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Do not reject \\(H_{o}\\). Conclusion There is (if you reject)\/is not (if you do not reject) evidence to suggest that\u2026 (Paraphrase the information in the question to complete the conclusion).    It is important to note that  The decision about the null hypothesis is not made with certainty but with a level of confidence that the error in the decision is small (for example 5% if \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)) The decision relates only to rejecting or not rejecting \\(H_{o}\\). \\(H_{a}\\) is not mentioned in the decision, and we DO NOT ACCEPT \\(H_{o}\\) or \\(H_{a}\\) The steps for hypothesis testing may differ from course to course so check with your program.     Example Because students had previously found a statistics course very difficult the average score over many years was \\(48\\)% with a standard deviation of \\(12\\)%. A bridging program was introduced and the \\(120\\) students that attended achieved a mean score of \\(50\\)% in the final exam. Is there evidence that the scores of those who attended the bridging program have changed at a \\(1\\)% level of significance?  State the hypotheses \\(H_{o}:\\) \\(\\overline{x}=48\\) (the sample mean is the same as the population mean) \\(H_{a}:\\overline{x}\\neq48\\) (the sample mean is not the same as the population mean) Significance level \\(\\alpha=0.01\\) Critical values \\(\\alpha=0.01\\) \\(\\Rightarrow z=-2.58\\textrm{ or }\\) \\(z=2.58\\)    Test statistic \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{\\overline{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{50-48}{\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{120}}}\\\\ &amp; =1.83. \\end{align*}\\] Decision: Is \\(1.83\\) more extreme than \\(2.58?\\) No \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Do not reject \\(H_{o}\\) Conclusion There is not enough evidence to suggest that the scores of those who attended the bridging program have changed. (It is reasonable that the apparent improvement is due to chance variation).     Exercises Your answers should be set out and contain all the steps shown above. A brief outline of the main features is given in the answers to teh following exercises. 1. Repeat the example to decide if there is evidence at the \\(10\\)% level of significance that attending the bridging program is associated with the change in scores.   2. A random sample of \\(36\\) soft drinks from vending machines had an average content of \\(370\\)ml with a standard deviation of \\(20\\)ml. Test the null hypothesis that \\(\\mu\\) \\(=375\\) ml against the alternative hypothesis \\(\\mu\\) \\(\\neq375\\)ml at the \\(1\\)% significance level.  3. A bank manager has historical data that shows over lunchtime Mon \u2013 Fri the mean number of customers that come into the bank is \\(32\\). Accordingly he believes he has no need to change the number of tellers. However a branch survey conducted every lunchtime over eight weeks found that the mean number of customers was \\(36\\) with a standard deviation of \\(8.2\\). Conduct a hypothesis test with a \\(5\\)% level of significance to test whether the mean number of lunchtime customers has changed. What recommendation would you make to the bank manager?   4. The manufacturer of \u2018longlast\u2019 batteries claims the mean lifetime of his batteries is \\(450\\) hours.

However, \\(\\sigma\\) is a fixed value and \\(s\\) varies with each sample. This creates a level of uncertainty that slightly distorts the shape of the distribution of sample means. The resulting curve is close to a normal distribution when \\(n\\) is large, but for small \\(n\\) it has heavier tails.  The precise shape of the t-distribution depends on the size of the sample. A t-distribution is always bell shaped but the shape of the curve varies according to the size of the sample. As the sample size increases, a t-distribution becomes more like the z-distribution.   T-tests A t-test is a hypothesis test which like the z-test is used to make decisions about the similarity of sample and population means. The test statistic is \\[ t=\\frac{\\overline{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\] Like a z-test it is assumed that the sample data is drawn randomly and that the distribution of sample means follows a normal distribution. Many students are confused about whether to use a z-test or a t-test to test their hypothesis. Generally,  if \\(\\sigma\\) is known, then a z-test is appropriate if \\(\\sigma\\) is not known, then a t-test is appropriate.  However,  Many text books only provide t-tables for \\(n\\leq30\\). For larger samples the z-distribution is a reasonable approximation and a z-test may be used even though \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown. Some courses provide students with more comprehensive t-tables for \\(n\\) up to \\(50\\) or \\(100\\). If you have access to relevant tables you should use a t-test whenever \\(\\sigma\\) is not known regardless of the size of the sample. If \\(s\\) is known to be a good approximation for \\(\\sigma\\) then a z-test may be appropriate. If a computer package such as SPSS, Minitab or EXCEL is being used for the hypothesis test then a t-test should be selected when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown.    The conventions differ between courses so check what is appropriate for your subject     Steps in a t-test  State the hypotheses \\(H_{o}:\\) \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}=\\mu\\) (the sample mean is the same as the population mean after allowing for chance variation) \\(H_{o}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\neq\\mu\\) (the sample mean is not the same as the population mean after allowing for chance variation) Significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is chosen (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\Rightarrow\\) we are defining reasonable as what we can expect 95% of the time) Critical values Tables or a calculator or a computer are used to find the t-value that corresponds to the chosen significance level.

Yes \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Reject \\(H_{o}\\) and No \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Do not reject \\(H_{o}\\). An alternative approach involves calculating the p-value and comparing it with \\(\\alpha\\). The p-value is a probability. It is a measure of the likelihood of the test statistic being obtained if the null hypothesis is true. If that probability is low enough we reject the null hypothesis. How low is low enough? This is the value \\(\\alpha\\) and it is set before we calculate the test statistic. Our question becomes: \u201cIs p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\)?\u201d Yes \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Reject \\(H_{o}\\) and No \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Do not reject \\(H_{o}\\).   Calculation of the p-value For a \\(2\\)-sided test, where \\(x_{o}\\) is the test statistic, the p-value is the sum of the areas of the two regions beyond \\(-\\left|x_{o}\\right|\\) and \\(\\left|x_{o}\\right|\\) as shown below.  For a \\(1\\)-sided test, where \\(x_{o}\\) is the test statistic, the p-value is either the area to the left of \\(x_{o}\\) for a left handed test, or the area to the right of \\(x_{o}\\) for a right sided test as shown below.  The six steps to conduct a hypothesis test then become:  State the null and alternative hypotheses Choose the level of significance, \\(\\alpha\\) Calculate the test statistic Compute the p-value of the test statistic Decide whether to reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p-value to \\(\\alpha\\) State your conclusion in words.   Example The student queries service at a university claim that during orientation week the average wait time to be seen is \\(23\\) minutes., However this has been disputed as feedback from student focus groups indicates the wait is much longer. To test the hypothesis, the wait time for \\(40\\) randomly selected students is recorded during the next orientation week., The average wait time is found to be \\(25\\) minutes with a standard deviation of \\(5\\) minutes., Is there evidence to support the hypothesis that the average wait time exceeds \\(23\\) minutes at a \\(5\\)% level of significance?  Hypotheses: \\(H_{o}:\\mu=23\\) \\(H_{a}:\\mu&gt;23\\) Significance level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Test statistic1 We are using a t-test because the population standard deviation is unknown. \\(t=\\frac{\\overline{x}-\\mu}{s_{\\overline{x}}}\\)= \\(\\frac{25-23}{\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{40}}}\\) = 2.53. P-value   The area to the right of \\(2.53\\) is \\(0.00778\\). 2 You must use technology (graphics calculator or an online tool such as Stat Trek) rather than tables to calculate the p-values for a \\(t\\) distribution  Decision Is \\(0.0078&lt;0.05\\)?

One Sided Claims For claims such as:  Queenslanders have a \\(greater\\) chance of skin cancer. The drop-out rate for Business students is \\(lower\\ than\\) the university average.

Hypothesis tests in which we are only concerned with change in ONE direction are called one sided or one tailed tests. The null and alternative hypotheses for one sided tests may be: \\(H_{o}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\leq\\mu\\) (the sample mean is not greater than the population mean after allowing for chance variation) \\(H_{a}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}&gt;\\mu\\) (the sample mean is greater than the population mean after allowing for chance variation) OR \\(H_{o}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\leq\\mu\\) (the sample mean is not less than the population mean after allowing for chance variation) \\(H_{a}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}&gt;\\mu\\) (the sample mean is less than the population mean after allowing for chance variation)   Conventions on how to write one sided hypotheses vary so always check with your program.     Critical Values In a two sided test with a significance level of \\(\\alpha\\), there are two critical values and the area of each upper and lower rejection region is \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\).  In one sided tests with a significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) there is only one critical value and the region of rejection with area \\(\\alpha\\) is on either the left OR the right side of the sampling distribution    Example A baking company claims that the amount of meat in its pies is at least \\(50g\\). However a consumer group has had many complaints and decides to conduct a test to check if the pies are being under filled. A random sample of \\(10\\) pies resulted in the following data: \\[\\begin{array}{cccccccccc} 45 &amp; 52 &amp; 51 &amp; 44 &amp; 50 &amp; 52 &amp; 48 &amp; 45 &amp; 43 &amp; 47\\end{array}\\] Is there evidence in this sample that the pies are being under filled?

Hypotheses \\(H_{o}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\leq50\\) \\(H_{a}:\\mu_{\\overline{x}}&gt;50\\) Significance level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) and a one sided t-test is appropriate. Critical values From tables: \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), degrees of freedom \\(=n-1=10-1=9\\Rightarrow t_{crit}=-1.833\\).    Test statistic: \\(t\\)= \\(\\frac{\\overline{x}-\\mu}{s_{\\overline{x}}}=\\frac{47-50}{\\frac{3.4}{\\sqrt{10}}}=-2.14\\). Decision Is the test statistic \\((-2.14)\\) more extreme than the critical value \\((-1.833)\\) ? Yes, therefore we reject \\(H_{o}\\). Conclusion There is evidence to suggest that the pies are being filled with less than \\(50g\\) of meat.   Exercises Nutrition guidelines for an aged care facility recommend that no more than \\(71.1mg\\) of a particular vitamin be consumed each day.

A long term analysis of Rabbit University students\u2019 study habits revealed that on average students study for 18 hours per week with a standard deviation of 4.2 hours. However, a random sample of 45 students in 2017 had a mean weekly study time of 14.68 hours.

How to Perform a Test of Proportions The steps to perform a test of proportion are:  Hypotheses State the null and alternative hypotheses. For example, if \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion and \\(p\\) the null hypothesised population proportion, then for a 2-sided test:1 Note: Some texts and courses may use other notation such as \\(\\pi\\) to represent the population proportion, and \\(p\\) to represent the sample proportion. \\[\\begin{align*} H_{o} &amp; :\\hat{p}=p \\end{align*}\\] (the proportion of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the given population proportion) \\[\\begin{align*} H_{a} &amp; :\\hat{p}\\neq p \\end{align*}\\] (the proportion of the population from which the sample is drawn is not the same as the given population proportion) A significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is chosen z-tables are used to find the critical values     For the assumption that the test statistic is normally distributed to be valid we require \\(np&gt;5\\) and \\(n(1-p)&gt;5\\).

Paraphrase the words in the question to complete the sentence.   Example A lecturer knows that historically \\(60\\)% of students do not begin their statistics assignment until within seven days of the due date. As a result they do not do well. To address this unfortunate reality, maths support services are widely promoted during the early weeks of the semester. A survey of 80 randomly selected students revealed that 42 had started the assignment before the final week. Is there evidence to suggest the promotion has been effective at the \\(10\\)% significance level? In this case \\(\\hat{p}=\\frac{42}{80}=0.525\\).  Hypotheses: \\(H_{o}:p=0.6\\) (the proportion of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the given population proportion) \\(H_{a}:p&lt;0.6\\) (the proportion of the population from which the sample is drawn is less than the given population proportion) Significance level \\(\\alpha=0.10\\) Critical values Assumption of normality is satisfied: \\(np=48&gt;5,n(1-p)=32&gt;5\\) From tables we find \\(z=-1.28\\).    Test statistic: \\(z=\\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}=\\frac{0.525-0.6}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.6(1-0.6)}{80}}}=-1.37\\) \\(-1.37\\) is more extreme than \\(-1.28\\), therefore we reject \\(H_{o}\\) . There is evidence to suggest that the promotion has been effective and that students are beginning their assignments earlier.     Exercises A survey conducted ten years ago showed that \\(18\\)% of students were the first in their family to attend a university. To evaluate widening participation programs a randomly selected sample of \\(120\\) enrolment records indicated that in \\(2017\\) this number had increased to \\(24\\)%.

Is there evidence that the companies claim is false at the \\(5\\)% level of significance?  In a rural community hospital \\(6\\) out of \\(7\\) babies born in a particular week were boys. Assuming that in the general population the probability of female and male babies is equal, test the claim that babies born at this hospital are more likely to be boys at the \\(10\\)% level of significance.

It was developed in the 1800s when mathematicians were asked to theorise on such matters as the annual number of wrongful criminal convictions in a particular country or to work out the number of soldiers in the Prussian cavalry who were likely to be kicked to death by a horse (honest!).  The Poisson distribution measures the probability that a certain number of random independent events occur within a period of time (or distance or area etc) when the average rate of occurrence is known. Examples of events described by a Poisson distribution distribution are:  the number of people who enter a shop every hour the number of flaws in a sheet of glass the numbers of cars that pass on a stretch of road over a certain time period the number of telephone calls a call center receives per minute the number of errors that occur in a system.    Definition The Poisson distribution is defined by: \\[ Pr(X=x)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{x}}{x!} \\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the mean or expected number of occurrences per unit time, distance, area or volume. The graph below shows how the Poisson distribution varies with \\(\\lambda\\).   Example Let us suppose that over the past years, on average, 3 soldiers were kicked to death by horses. What is the probability that next year there will be 4 kicked to death? In this case \\(\\lambda\\)= 3 (the average or expected value) and \\(x\\) = 4 (the number of successes) \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Using the formula }Pr(X=x) &amp; =\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{x}}{x!}\\\\ Pr(X=4) &amp; =\\frac{e^{-3}3^{4}}{4!}\\\\ &amp; =0.168. \\end{align*}\\]    The Poisson Approximation to the Binomial Distribution You will recall that, in many instances, the normal distribution can be used to obtain fairly good approximations to binomial probabilities. The approximation works best when \\(p\\) is close to \\(0.5\\) and the approximation improves as \\(n\\) gets larger. As a general rule both \\(np\\) and \\(nq\\) should be greater than or equal to \\(5\\) in order to use the normal approximation. But, what if \\(p\\) is not close to \\(0.5\\)? If \\(p\\) is small \\((&lt;0.05)\\) and \\(n\\) is large, then we can use the Poisson distribution to approximate the binomial distribution, where the parameter, \\(\\lambda=np\\).  Example A sample of 50 people is chosen from a population in which 1% suffer from schizophrenia. What is the probability that 2 of these people are schizophrenic?  Using the binomial distribution we have \\(n=50\\), \\(p=0.01\\), \\(q=0.99\\) so   1 Remember for a binomial distribution, where \\(p\\) is the probability of a success and \\(q\\) is the probability of a failure \\(\\left(q=1-p\\right)\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(X=x\\right) &amp; ={n \\choose x}p^{x}q^{n-x}. \\end{align*}\\]  \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr(X=x) &amp; ={n \\choose x}p^{x}q^{n-x}\\\\ \\Pr(X=2) &amp; ={50 \\choose 2}\\times0.01^{2}\\times0.99^{48}\\\\ &amp; =0.0756 \\end{align*}\\]  Using the Poisson approximation: \\(\\lambda=np=50\\times0.01=0.5\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr(X=x) &amp; =\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{x}}{x!}\\\\ \\Pr(X=2) &amp; =\\frac{e^{-0.5}0.5^{2}}{2!}\\\\ &amp; =0.0758 \\end{align*}\\] You can see that the Poisson distribution gives a good approximation and this approximation would be even more accurate if \\(n\\) was larger.     Exercises On average one birth in every 100 produces twins. Use the Poisson distribution to find the probability that of the next 250 births there is one set of twins?  A manufacturer of electric light globes knows from past experience that 2% of globes produced are defective. Use the Poisson distribution to approximate the probability that, out of the next 200 globes, less than 2 are defective?  The chance of death by drowning is \\(\\frac{1}{30000}\\) . Use the Poisson distribution to estimate the probability that, out of a random selection of 1500 people there will be at least one death by drowning.  Insurance companies have found that the probability that a residential property is damaged by fire at some stage over a 25 year period is 0.01. If a company insures 20 houses in a particular street, use the Poisson distribution to approximate the probability that 2 of them will be damaged by fire in the next 25 years?

Worked Exercises 1. Determine how many electrons an aluminium atom has to lose or gain to obtain a noble gas electron configuration. Answer The purpose of losing or gaining an electron is to acquire an octet in the valence shell. \\(\\ce{Al}\\)'s electron configuration is \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{1}\\). The valence shell contains three electrons. \\(\\ce{Al}\\) can obtain the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ne}\\), which is the noble gas just before \\(\\ce{Al}\\), by losing those three electrons, . The \\(\\ce{Al}\\) atom has \\(13\\) electrons and \\(13\\) protons in the neutral state. When it loses three electrons, \\(\\ce{Al}\\) has three excess protons giving rise to a cation, \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\). \\[ \\ce{Al}^{3+}\\;1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}=\\left[\\ce{Ne}\\right] \\] 2. The neutral \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom has eight electrons and eights protons. Explain how \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom acquires valence shell octet. Answer The electron configuration of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{4}\\). The valence shell has four electrons. It can achieve an octet and stable noble gas electron configuration by gaining two electrons into a \\(2p\\) orbital. Therefore, \\(\\ce{O}\\) produces \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\) ion, which has two excess electrons. \\[ \\ce{O}^{2-}\\;1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}=\\left[\\ce{Ne}\\right] \\] 3. Determine the chemical formula of the compound produced when \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\) ions interact. Answer There are two ways of writing chemical formulas. Method 1: First, write down the symbol of the cation with its charge followed by the anion. \\[ \\ce{Ca}^{2+} \\] \\[ \\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\ce{F}^{-} \\] Next, cross each ions charge (only the numerical value, not the sign) and write it down as subscripts. So, calcium ion's charge will be written next to fluoride ion, and fluoride ion's charge will be written next to calcium ion, in both cases as subscripts   Method 2: \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) ion has a \\(+2\\) charge, and \\(\\ce{F}\\) ion has a \\(-1\\) charge. Two \\(\\ce{F}\\) ions, each with \\(-1\\) charge, will neutralise the \\(+2\\) charge of \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) ion. Therefore, the chemical formula is \\[ \\ce{CaF2} \\] 4. Write the chemical formula for a compound composed of \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\) and \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\). Answer First, write down the symbol of the cation followed by the anion with their charges. \\[ \\ce{Al}^{3+}\\ce{O}^{2-} \\] Next, cross over the numerical values of the charges to get the chemical formula. \\[ \\ce{Al}_{2}\\ce{O}_{3} \\] 5. Write the chemical formula of the compound formed by copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) ions and sulfate ions. Answer Copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) ion \\(=\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) Sulfate ion \\(=\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) Copper ion has a \\(+2\\) charge, and sulphate ion has a \\(-2\\) charge. The \\(+2\\) charge of copper ion cancels off to the \\(-2\\) charge of sulphate ion resulting in a neutral compound. So, the chemical formula is \\(\\ce{CuSO}_{4}\\). Exercises  \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) loses two electrons to acquire the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ar}\\). What is the chemical symbol of the ion that it forms?   \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2-}\\) \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\) \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) \\(\\ce{Ca}^{+}\\)    When \\(\\ce{N}\\) reacts with other elements, it gains three electrons.

Cations are formed when metals gain electrons. Anions are formed when neutral atoms gain electrons. By losing electrons, alkaline earth metals acquire the electron configuration of a noble gas just after them. By gaining electrons, halogens achieve the electron configuration of a noble gas just before them.    Which of the following statements is incorrect?   Metals tend to form cations Nonmetals tend to form anions Octet rule states that atoms lose or gain electrons to acquire completely filled valence shell that contains \\(8\\) electrons Noble gases are very reactive due to their electron configurations    What is the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Mg}^{2+}\\)?   \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}4s^{2}\\)    What is the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\)?   \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{5}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}\\)    What is the electron configuration of the ion that \\(_{19}\\ce{K}\\) forms?   \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}4s^{1}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}\\) \\(1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}4s^{2}4p^{6}\\)    How many electrons does \\(\\ce{O}\\) gain to acquire a noble gas configuration?   \\(8\\) \\(6\\) \\(2\\) \\(10\\)    Which of the following ions does exist?   \\(\\ce{S}^{-}\\) \\(\\ce{C}^{2+}\\) \\(\\ce{Al}^{4+}\\) \\(\\ce{Cs}^{+}\\)    What are the common ions formed by \\(_{29}\\ce{Cu}\\)?   \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{3+}\\) \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{3+}\\) \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\)and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{3+}\\)    What is the symbol of the ion formed by Beryllium losing two electrons from the valence shell?   \\(\\ce{Be}^{+}\\) \\(\\ce{Be}^{2+}\\) \\(\\ce{Ba}^{2+}\\) \\(\\ce{Ba}^{+}\\)    What is the name of \\(\\ce{Cr}^{2+}\\) ion?

Areas under the standard normal distribution curve represent probabilities which can be found via a calculator or a \u201cz-table\u201d.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Statistics\n\n\n\n    The standard normal distribution (sometimes called a z-distribution) has a mean of zero (\\(\\mu=0\\)) and a standard deviation of \\(1\\ (\\sigma=1)\\).    Tables and Probabilities If we are working with the standard normal distribution we are not restricted to the 68-95-99 rule because tables are available to enable us to find proportions or percentages or probabilities for any value in the distribution. Tables come in different layouts, but this table (a portion of the table is shown below) gives the proportion to the left of a chosen z-value of up to 2 decimal places.  We can interpret our proportions or percentages as probabilities: \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.00\\right)=0.500\\) or \\(50\\)%.1 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.00\\) in the top row of the table. \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.03\\right)=0.512\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.2 This corresponds to the number \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.03\\) in the top row of the table. \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.75\\right)=0.7734\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.3 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.7\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.05\\) in the top row of the table.   Note that a graphics calculator or a computer can also be used to find areas, proportions and probabilities in a normal distribution, rather than the table used here.    Example 1: In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be less than 1.28? Solution: Draw a diagram as follows.  We are looking for the shaded area to the left of \\(z=1.28.\\) Using the following table we find that the area to the left is \\(0.8997\\).  So the percentage is \\(89.97\\)%.   Example 2: In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be more than 1.28? Solution: We want to find the percentage area shown below.  We cannot read areas to the right of a z-value directly from the table at the end of this module. Instead we observe that: 100% of all values lie under the curve. The area to the left of the shaded region is the same as part a). So the percentage of values to the right of \\(1.28\\) will be \\(100\\)% minus the percentage to the left of \\(1.28\\). Therefore the percentage of values more than \\(1.28\\) is \\(100\\)%\\(-\\) \\(89.97\\)% = \\(10.03\\)%.   Example 3: In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\)? Solution: We want to find the percentage area shown below.  We cannot look up areas between two values directly from the table. But we know from Example 1 that 89.97% of values are less than 1.28. We also know \\(50\\)% of values lie to the left of the mean \\(\\left(z=0\\right)\\) because this is a property of our symmetrical bell curve. Therefore the percentage of values between \\(0\\) and 1.28 is \\(89.97\\)% \\(-\\) \\(50\\)% = \\(39.97\\)%.   Example 4: In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be greater than \\(-1.28\\)? Solution: We want to find the percentage area shown below.  We cannot usually look up negative values in the table.4 There are some normal distribution tables that include negative z values. But we know that the bell curve is symmetrical as shown below:  The area to the right of \\(-1.28\\) is the same as the area to the left of \\(1.28\\). Therefore the percentage of values greater than \\(-1.28\\) is \\(89.97\\)% from Example 1.   Example 5: In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\)? Solution: To find this area we use the symmetry of the graph. Observe that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\).  To find this area we use the symmetry of the graph. Observe that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\). We know the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28=39.97\\)% because we found it in Example 3 above. Therefore the percentage of the graph between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\) is \\(2\\times39.97\\)% \\(=79.8\\)%.    Exercises  In a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be  \\(\\quad\\)(a) less than \\(1.95\\)? \\(\\quad\\)(b) less than \\(-1.95\\)? \\(\\quad\\)(c)between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(0\\)? \\(\\quad\\)(d) greater than \\(1.95\\)? \\(\\quad\\)(e) between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(1.95.\\)  Note that answers may vary slightly depending on whether tables or calculators are used.

In a standard normal distribution what proportion of values lie outside the interval \\(\\pm1.7\\)?

But every score in a normally distributed data set, regardless of the shape, has an equivalent score in the standard distribution. The mean of a normal distribution corresponds to a standardised score of \\(0\\) and we can see that \\(\\mu\\pm\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm1\\), \\(\\mu\\pm2\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm2\\) and \\(\\mu\\pm3\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm3\\).     \\(z-\\)Scores For other values of the mean and standard deviation, we can use the formula \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{align*}\\] to find \\(z\\) scores (where the \\(z\\) score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean). For example, if we have a Normal Distribution with a mean of \\(1.2\\) and a standard deviation of \\(0.4\\), then to find the standardised score for \\(x=1.7\\):  \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(1.7-1.2)}{0.4}\\\\ &amp; =1.25 \\end{align*}\\] A score of \\(1.7\\) in the distribution with mean \\(1.2\\) and standard deviation \\(0.4\\) is equivalent to a standardised score of \\(1.25\\). Alternatively, we could say that the score \\(1.7\\) is \\(1.25\\) standard deviations above the mean for that distribution.   Calculating Probabilities Using \\(z-\\)Scores Once we have converted the scores of our distribution into standard scores or \\(z\\)-scores we can use normal distribution tables to calculate precise percentages and probabilities. The normal distribution is a continuous distribution, so we can find the probability that \\(x\\) is greater than or less than a particular value, but not that \\(x\\) is equal to a particular value. Because the total area under the standardised curve is \\(1\\), \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;\\beta\\right)\\) is equivalent to the area to the left of \\(\\beta.\\)   Example 1 If the mean maximum temperature for Melbourne in January is \\(25.9^{\\circ}\\)C with a standard deviation of \\(2.1^{\\circ}\\) what is the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C? First draw a diagram.  \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =28\\\\ z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(28-25.9)}{2.1}\\\\ &amp; =1.\\\\ \\Pr\\left(x&gt;28\\right) &amp; =\\Pr\\left(z&gt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-\\Pr\\left(z&lt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-0.8413\\ \\ \\left(0.8413\\textrm{ is from the table at end of this module}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0.1587. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C is \\(0.1587.\\)   Example 2 The top \\(0.5\\)% of students applying for Stato university are given full scholarships. If the mean score on the entrance exam is \\(372\\) and the standard deviation is \\(40\\), what mark is needed to obtain a scholarship? First draw a diagram.  The area to the right of \\(x_{s}=0.005\\).1 We want to find \\(x_{s}\\). We know that \\(\\Pr\\left(x&gt;x_{s}\\right)=0.005\\) but we must first find the \\(z\\)- score corresponding to this. Let\u2019s call it \\(z_{s}.\\) Then \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(z&gt;z_{s}\\right) &amp; =0.005 \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(z&lt;z_{s}\\right) &amp; =1-0.005\\\\ &amp; =0.9950. \\end{align*}\\] Using the table at the end of this module, we look up \\(0.995\\) in the body of the table and see that the corresponding \\(z\\)- score is \\(z_{s}=2.57\\) or \\(z_{s}=2.58\\). We will take \\(z_{s}=2.58.\\)2 You could take the average of \\(2.57\\) and \\(2.58\\) in this case, that is \\(2.575\\) but two decimal places of accuracy is usually enough. Now using the formula we have \\[\\begin{align*} z_{s} &amp; =\\frac{x_{s}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\\\ 2.58 &amp; =\\frac{x_{s}-372}{40}.\\\\ \\textrm{Rearranging we have, }x_{s} &amp; =2.58\\times40+372\\\\ &amp; =475.2\\,. \\end{align*}\\] So applicants who score more than \\(475.2\\) will get a scholarship.    Exercises 1. If a population has a mean I.Q. of \\(100\\) and a standard deviation of \\(15\\), find:  the probability that an individual chosen at random will have an I.Q. between \\(110\\) and \\(130\\). the probability that an individual chosen at random will have an I.Q. greater than \\(87\\).   2.

The sampling distribution will be normally distributed with parameters \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\), if either:  the population from which the samples are drawn is normally distributed, or the samples are large \\((n\\geqq30)\\).  The mean of the sampling distribution (i.e.\u00a0the mean of all the sample means, \\(\\mu\\) \\(_{\\overline{x}}\\)) and the standard deviation of the distribution (\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\)) are given by: \\[ \\mu_{\\overline{x}}=\\mu\\quad and\\quad\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] Note that:  The sampling distribution has the same centre as the population. The measure of variability of a sampling distribution, \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\), is called the standard error. The distribution of means is not as spread out as the values in the population from which the sample was drawn. If we do not know the population standard deviation we approximate with the sample standard deviation: \\(s_{\\overline{x}}\\) \\(\\thickapprox\\) \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) \\(\\thickapprox\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) if the sample is large.    Example of a Sampling Distribution Consider the little \u2018population\u2019 of values P = {1 2 3 4 5} This population has \\(\\mu=3\\) and \\(\\sigma=1.41\\) .

But the variability in the sampling distribution is less than that of the population: \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}=0.61\\) and \\(\\sigma=1.41\\).

Start animations Stop animations  Schrodinger's wave mechanical model Electrons behave as waves around the nucleus such that a stable energy state is only established when an integral number of wavelengths are \"quantized\" (quantum means a specific amount) into the orbital to produce a \"stationary state\", a confined electron wave. In this model, electrons occupy a three-dimensional space around the nucleus. The Bohr model and the Schrodinger's model:    Energy levels within an atom Space, where electrons move around the nucleus, is divided into subspaces known as shells, subshells and orbitals.  Electron shells - Electron shells are named outward from the nucleus as \\(1,2,3,4\\) and so on. The energy of the electron shells increases with the distance from the nucleus. Therefore, the electrons closest to the nucleus have lower energy than the electrons located further away.    Electron subshells - The number of subshells in a shell is equal to the shell number. Subshells are labeled as \\(s,p,d\\) and \\(f\\). Each subshell contains a certain number of electrons. An \\(s\\) subshell contains up to \\(2\\) electrons, a \\(p\\) subshell contains up to \\(6\\) electrons, a \\(d\\) subshell contains up to \\(10\\) electrons, and a \\(f\\) subshell contains up to \\(14\\) electrons. Electron orbitals - An electron orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons where one must spin up and the other spin down. Therefore, an \\(s\\) subshell has one orbital, a \\(p\\) subshell has three orbitals, a \\(d\\) subshell has five orbitals and an \\(f\\) subshell has seven orbitals. Orbitals have distinct shapes, \\(s\\) orbitals are spherical, \\(p\\) orbitals are dumb-bell. Orbitals within the same subshell that have the same shape are generally of equal energy but have a different orientation in space, such as \\(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\\) (\\(x,y,z\\) denote the orientation in space).      Writing electron configurations  Electron subshells are filled in order of increasing energy. The figure below displays the electron filling order. Subshell \\(4s\\) has lower energy than subshell \\(3d\\). Therefore \\(4s\\) fills before \\(3d\\). Each orbital can accommodate up to \\(2\\) electrons. Electrons fill into orbitals of a subshell so that each orbital acquires one electron before any orbital acquires a second electron. All single electrons must have the same spin.

The way the elements are arranged reveals information about their properties.  &times; Select the elements in the table below to learn more about their properties and history.            \\[\\require{mhchem}\\] The periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number. The rows and columns in the periodic table are known as periods and groups, respectively.  Groups The elements in each group have similar chemical properties due to the similarity in their valence electron configurations. Example: Group \\(\\mathrm{1}\\) elements       Elements Electron configuration     \\(\\ce{_{3}Li}\\) \\(1s^{2}\\:2s^{1}\\)   \\(\\ce{_{11}Na}\\) \\(1s^{2}\\:2s^{2}2p^{6}\\:3s^{1}\\)   \\(\\ce{_{19}K}\\) \\(1s^{2}\\:2s^{2}2p^{6}\\:3s^{2}3p^{6}\\:4s^{1}\\)   \\(\\ce{_{37}Rb}\\) \\(1s^{2}\\:2s^{2}2p^{6}\\:3s^{2}3p^{6}3d^{10}\\:4s^{2}4p^{6}\\:5s^{1}\\)    All of these elements have one \\(s\\) electron in their outermost (valence) shell. Group \\(\\mathrm{I}\\) elements, except hydrogen, are soft metals and demonstrate high reactivity with water and oxygen.   Valence electrons and core electrons Electrons located in the outermost shell (largest and highest-energy shell) of an atom are known as valence electrons. The rest of the electrons in the atom are known as core electrons. Valence electrons are accessible, thus participate in the chemical reactions. Core electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus and inaccessible.   Classification of the elements  Groups of elements         Group Name Examples Chemical properties     \\(\\mathrm{I}\\)A Alkali metals \\(\\ce{Li}\\), \\(\\ce{Na}\\), \\(\\ce{K}\\) Soft and shiny metals, highly reactive with water   \\(\\mathrm{II}\\)A Alkaline earth metals \\(\\ce{Be,\\,Mg,\\,Ca}\\) Soft and shiny metals, moderately reactive with water   \\(\\mathrm{VII}\\)A Halogens \\(\\ce{F,\\,Cl,\\,Br}\\) Generally reactive elements, exist as gases at room temperature   \\(\\mathrm{\\mathrm{VIII}}\\)A Noble gases \\(\\ce{He,\\,Ne,\\,Ar}\\) Exist as gases, unreactive elements      Metals and non-metals Based on selected physical properties, elements are classified into metals and nonmetals. Metals are located on the left side of the periodic table, and nonmetals are located on the right. Physical properties of metals - conductors of electricity and heat, exist as solids at room temperature (except Mercury), ductile, malleable, shiny appearance (metallic lustre), high density and high melting point. Elements know as metalloids exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties. Metalloids are located between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table.   s,p,d,f blocks The elements in the periodic table are categorised into \\(s,p,d,f\\) blocks based on the location of the last electron. The \\(s\\) block contains elements that have their last electron in \\(s\\) subshell. Similarly, \\(p,d,f\\) blocks have elements with their last electron located in \\(p,d,f\\) subshells, respectively.    Classification based on electron configurations of the elements  The noble gases - The last electron located in the \\(p\\) subshell except \\(\\ce{He}\\). All noble gases, except \\(\\ce{He}\\) have electron configuration ending with \\(p^{6}\\) (completes the \\(p\\) subshell). The representative elements - The elements located in \\(s\\) block and the first five columns of \\(p\\) block belongs to the representative elements group. The last electron of these elements fills an \\(s\\) subshell partially or entirely or fills a \\(p\\) subshell partially. The transition elements - The elements located in the \\(d\\) block. The inner transition elements - The elements located in the \\(f\\) block.   Classification of the periodic table based on electron configuration of the elements.   Periodic table trends  Atomic radii Atomic radii increase from the top to the bottom of a group of the periodic table. As \\(n\\) increases when proceeding down a group, valence orbitals become larger, leading to an increase in atomic radii. In contrast, from left to right of a period, atomic radii decrease. The effective nuclear charge (Z) increases when the atomic number (Z) increases across the period. As a result of the higher Z, orbitals become smaller.   Ionisation energy The first ionisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. The second and third ionisation energies are the energies necessary to remove more electrons from the atom. First ionisation energy increases when moving from left to right across a period as larger Z makes electrons bound tightly. When proceeding down on a group, the first ionisation energy decreases as an electron in a higher energy level is easier to remove. The trend in the first ionisation energy is inverse of the atomic radii.   Electron affinity Electron affinity is the amount of energy change when an electron is added to a gaseous phase atom to form an anion. The electron affinity becomes more negative when moving across a period from left to right.   Electronegativity Electronegativity is the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons. The larger the value, the larger the electron attracting ability. Atoms with higher electronegativity form anions, whereas atoms with smaller electronegativity form cations. Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom and increases from left to right of the periodic table.

Example Suppose that in a particular family the probability that a child will have red hair is \\(1\/4.\\) Then, if the parents have three children:  the probability that all three will have red hair is \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\textrm{Red and Red and Red}) &amp; =P(R_{1}\\cap R_{2}\\cap R_{3})\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{64}. \\end{align*}\\] the probability that none will have red hair is \\[\\begin{align*} P(\\overline{R}_{1}\\cap\\overline{R}_{2}\\cap\\overline{R}_{3}) &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{27}{64}. \\end{align*}\\] the probability that at least one child will have red hair is 1 Note: \u201cat least one child has red hair\u201d and \u201cno children have red hair\u201d are complementary events. \\[\\begin{align*} 1-P(\\textrm{none with red hair}) &amp; =1-P(\\overline{R}_{1}\\cap\\overline{R}_{2}\\cap\\overline{R}_{3})\\\\ &amp; =1\\text{\\textendash}\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\\\ &amp; =1-\\frac{27}{64}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{37}{64}. \\end{align*}\\] the probability that only the first child will have red hair is \\[\\begin{align*} P(R_{1}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{2}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{3}) &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{64}. \\end{align*}\\] the probability that exactly one child will have red hair is 2 This example demonstrates that it is important to consider all the ways in which the child with red hair might be selected. \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; P(R_{1}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{2}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{3})+P(\\overline{R}_{1}\\textrm{ and }R_{2}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{3})+P(\\overline{R}_{1}\\textrm{ and }\\overline{R}_{2}\\textrm{ and }R_{3})\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =3\\times\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{1}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =3\\times\\frac{9}{64}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{27}{64}. \\end{align*}\\]     Binomial Probability Formula If \u201c\\(n\\)\u201d is the number of trials (for example, the number of tosses of a coin, the number of children in a family, the number of items in a sample), and \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d is the probability of the outcome of interest then the probability of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d outcomes is given by the formula \\[\\begin{align*} P(X=x) &amp; =\\textrm{}^{n}C\\textrm{}_{x}\\times p^{x}\\times\\textrm{$(1-p)^{n-x}$ } &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(^{n}C_{x}\\) is the number of ways of selecting \\(x\\) items from a popoulation of \\(n\\) items, without regard to order, and \\[\\begin{align*} ^{n}C_{x} &amp; =\\frac{n!}{x!\\left(n-x\\right)!}. \\end{align*}\\]  Example One in every hundred items a machine produces are defective. What is the probability that in a sample of five items produced by this machine (a) Exactly three are defective? (b) None are defective ? (c) At least 1 is defective? Solution: We have \\(n=5,\\quad p=\\frac{1}{100}=0.01,\\quad x=3\\)  Using equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) from above \\[\\begin{align*} P(X=x) &amp; =\\textrm{}^{n}C\\textrm{}_{x}\\times p^{x}\\times\\textrm{$(1-p)^{n-x}$ }\\\\ P(X=3) &amp; =\\textrm{}^{5}C\\textrm{}_{3}\\times0.01^{3}\\times\\textrm{$(1-0.01)^{5-3}$ }\\\\ &amp; \\approx0.00001. \\end{align*}\\] So if we obtained three defective items in a sample of \\(5\\) we might be suspicious of the claim that only one in a hundred is defective! Using equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) from above \\[\\begin{align*} P(X=0) &amp; =\\textrm{}^{5}C\\textrm{}_{0}\\times0.01^{0}\\times\\textrm{$(1-0.01)^{5}$ }\\\\ &amp; \\approx0.95\\,. \\end{align*}\\] Remember \u201cnone defective\u201d and \u201cat least one defective\u201d are complementary events. So  \\[\\begin{align*} P(X\\geq1) &amp; =1-P(X=0)\\\\ &amp; =1-0.95\\\\ &amp; =0.05. \\end{align*}\\]    Binomial Probability Distribution A list of all possible outcomes of an event and their associated probabilities is called a probability distribution. The probability distribution table for the event \\(X\\) in the example above is (to five decimal places):    \\(x\\) (no. of defectives) 0 1 2 3 4 5     \\(P(X=x)\\) 0.95099 0.04803 0.00097 0.00001 0.00000 0.00000    For a binomial distribution the mean \\(\\mu\\) or expected value and standard deviation \\(\\sigma,\\)are found using the formulae: \\[ \\mu=E(X)=np \\] and \\[ \\sigma=SD(X)=\\sqrt{np(1-p)} \\] where \\(E(X)\\) is known as the expected value. For the previous example, the expected value and standard deviation of the number of defectives in a batch of one thousand would be \\[\\begin{align*} \\mu &amp; =E(X)\\\\ &amp; =1000\\times0.01\\\\ &amp; =10 \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sigma &amp; =\\sqrt{np(1-p)}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{1000\\times0.01\\times0.99}\\\\ &amp; =3.15\\,. \\end{align*}\\] So that in a batch of \\(1000\\) we would expect to get \\(10\\) defectives and the number of defectives will deviate from this amount by an \u201caverage\u201d of \\(3.15\\). We would expect most batches to have between \\(7\\) and \\(13\\) defective items.   Exercise The probability that an archer will hit a bullseye is \\(0.7\\). If he is allowed ten attempts, find the probability that he (a) hits it every time (b) misses each time (c) scores two bulls-eyes (d) scores at least two bulls-eyes (e) How many bulls-eyes would you expect him to score?

Example A card is chosen at random from a pack. If the first card chosen is the jack of diamonds and it is not replaced what is the probability that the second card is  a diamond? 1Because the first card was the jack of diamonds and not replaced, there is one less diamond in the pack and one less card in the pack.

Sunburnt Not sunburnt      Hat 3 77 80   No hat 12 8 20    15 85 100    Solution: Let \\(H'\\) be the event \u201cthe person is not wearing a hat\u201d. We want \\(\\Pr\\left(S|H'\\right)\\). The total sample space involves one hundred people. We can reduce this by confining out attention to those not wearing a hat. From row three of the table we see that of the 20 people not wearing a hat, 12 of them were sunburnt. So \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr\\left(S|H'\\right) &amp; =\\frac{12}{20}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{5}. \\end{align*}\\]    Exercises 1.

These are charged species. The charge of an ion depends on whether the atom gains (negatively charged or anions) or loses electrons (positively charged or cations). Examples: \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\),\\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\), \\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\), \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\), \\(\\ce{N}^{3-}\\) Octet Rule The valence electron configuration of noble gases is considered the most stable valence electron configuration. Except for helium, all noble gases have eight electrons in their valence shell (completely filled \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) subshells). The main group metals attempt to achieve the electron configuration of the noble gas just before them in the periodic table by losing electrons. Main group nonmetals acquire the electron configuration of the noble gas just after them in the periodic table by gaining electrons. For instance, potassium's electron configuration is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\,4s^{1}\\). Potassium loses one electron (\\(4s\\) electron) and becomes potassium cation (\\(\\ce{K}^{+}\\)) to achieve noble gas electron configuration: \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\). The electron configuration of chlorine is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{5}\\). To achieve noble gas electron configuration, chloride gains one electron (\\(3p\\) electron) and becomes chloride anion (\\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)) : \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}3p^{6}\\). Therefore, in general, metals form cations and nonmetals form anions. When forming bonds, atoms attempt to achieve stable noble gas configuration by sharing, losing or gaining electrons for each of the atoms associated. Naming Monoatomic Ions Main group cations are named using the name of the element followed by ion. For instance, \\(\\ce{Li}^{+}\\): Lithium ion, \\(\\ce{Mg}^{2+}\\): Magnesium ion and \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\): Aluminium ion. Transition metals (\\(d,f\\)blocks) and some \\(p\\) block elements can form multiple cations such as \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\), \\(\\ce{Pb}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Pb}^{4+}\\). These types of cations can be named in two ways. The first is that the ion with the smaller charge ends with \"-ous\" and the larger charge ends with \"-ic\". For instance, \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)is cuprous ion and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) is cupric ion. The other is writing the charge of the ion in Roman numerals within parenthesis next to the element name. For example, \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)is Copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{I}\\right)\\) ion, and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) is Copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\). Anions are named by removing the ending of the element name and replacing it with \"-ide\". For instance, the anion formed by \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) is the Chloride ion. Polyatomic Ions Polyatomic ions consist of more than one atom. For example, \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\)(sulphate), \\(\\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}\\) (nitrate), \\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\) (phosphate) and \\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\) (ammonium) ions. Atoms in polyatomic ions are held together by covalent bonds. Isoelectronic Species Isoelectronic species are atoms and ions that have an equal number of electrons. For example, \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\), \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\), \\(\\ce{Ne}\\), \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Mg^{2+}}\\). All of these species contain \\(10\\) electrons. Ionic Bonds Ionic bonds are created between metals and non-metals by transferring electrons from metals to non-metals. Metals provide the cation (lose electrons), and nonmetals provide the anion (gain electrons). Generally, bonds formed between atoms with larger electronegativity 1 (e.g. elements in groups 16 and 17 of the periodic table) and smaller electronegativity (e.g. elements in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table) are ionic. For instance, \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\): difference between electronegativities of \\(\\ce{Na}\\) (EN\\(=0.93\\)) and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) (EN\\(=3.16\\)) is \\(2.23\\). For an ionic compound to be formed, the difference between electronegativities of two participating atoms must be larger than or equal to two. The larger difference in electronegativity creates electrostatic interactions between the electrons of one atom and the nucleus of the other atom. 2 Play animationStop animation    Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds are held together by electrostatic interactions between cations and anions involved. The cations and anions are arranged in such a way that gaps between ions are filled efficiently and permit maximum electrostatic interactions. Ionic compounds are polar materials. Writing Chemical Formulas for Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds are neutral species. Ions involved in an ionic compound combine in such a ratio that the net charge becomes zero. Parentheses are used to enclosed polyatomic ions when more than one polyatomic ions are involved in an ionic compound. In that case, the subscript is written outside the parentheses. For instance, \\(\\ce{Fe}_{2}\\left(\\ce{SO}_{4}\\right)_{3}\\) and \\(\\left(\\ce{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2}\\ce{CO}_{3}\\). The chemical formula of an ionic compound displays the lowest possible ratio that ions can combine. Naming Ionic Compounds  First, write the name of the cation followed by the anion's name with a space in between. For example, \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) is written as sodium chloride, \\(\\ce{MgSO4}\\) is written as magnesium sulphate. Transitional metals and some of the \\(p\\) block elements have more than one charge. Therefore, if the cation is from those groups, it is essential to include the charge within parentheses next to its name in Roman numerals or use \"-ous\" and \"-ic\" to indicate smaller charge and larger charge, respectively. For instance, \\(\\ce{CuSO4}\\) is written as copper\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) sulphate or cupric sulphate, \\(\\ce{FeCl2}\\) is written as iron\\(\\left(\\mathrm{II}\\right)\\) chloride or ferrous chloride.  Physical Properties of Ionic Compounds  Crystalline solids Conduct electricity in solution state High melting points and boiling points Soluble in polar solvents   1Electronegativity is the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons. 2The attraction forces between oppositely charged ions are known as electrostatic interactions.   const manual = new Freezeframe('.freezeme', { trigger: false }); document .querySelector('.start') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.start(); }); document .querySelector('.stop') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.stop(); });  ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1444 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Ions are produced when electrons transfer entirely from one atom to another.

Ask yourself: what is the deeper meaning of the text? What are its implications? Evaluation: judge the text's strengths and weaknesses. Judge whether the text is important in terms of its contribution to the field.   Read the passage below The discovery of antibiotics was contributed to by two scientists, Alexander Fleming and Howard Florey. Prior to 1942 patients in hospitals were dying from sepsis after amputations or from other invasive procedures. Women died in large numbers from infections caused by childbirth, and there was no great effort being made to find some form of antibacterial agent. In 1930, the microbiologist Fleming, who was studying micro-organisms and their growth patterns, wrote up his observations of the effect of bacteria on an organism for a small medical journal in London commenting that this might be worth further investigation; however, it wasn't followed up for 10 years. During the Second World War, men injured in battle were dying from sepsis in wounds. An Australian, Florey, who was working at Oxford University, was given the job as part of a PhD to try and find some bacterial agent. He came across the article written by Fleming and decided to follow it up. He managed to isolate enough penicillin from the penicillium fungus to treat one patient. America put money into this research and Florey and his assistant started to produce penicillin on a mass scale. There was enough produced in 1942 and 1943 to treat most of the allied soldiers, sailors and airmen that were being injured.  This text was devised for teaching purposes only. The content is regarded as general knowledge   Apply the four levels of critical thinking  The passage about the contributions of Fleming and Florey can be critically analysed by considering the following points.  Florey, building on the work of Fleming, managed to isolate penicillin during the Second World War. (Comprehension: presents the same information as the original. It restates the information.) The passage compares the contributions made by two scientists to the development of a life-saving anti-bacterial agent. (Analysis: discusses the way the material is presented and structured, showing deeper insight.) The high numbers of soldiers dying of wound infection in the Second World War was the possible catalyst for the invention of penicillin. (Interpretation: attempts to find a deeper meaning, interpreting the overall meaning of the passage.) The article provides a good basic summary of the early history of penicillin, but it ignores the work done by Moyer which allowed the drug to be produced in large quantities. (Evaluation: judges the text in terms of its strengths and weaknesses.)

Such data is said to be normally distributed.   Properties of a Normal Distribution  Symmetry about the mean Mean = median = mode 50% of values greater than the mean and 50% less than the mean 68% of values fall within one standard deviation either side of the mean (approximately) 95% of values fall within two standard deviations either side of the mean (approximately) 99.7% of values fall within three standard deviation either side of the mean (approximately)  Note: Even though most of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean there is in theory, no upper or lower bound to a normal distribution. We are just less and less likely to find values beyond these points.  Example If scores on an IQ test are normally distributed with mean \\(=100\\) and standard deviation \\(=10\\), what percentage of people would we expect to  score between 90 and 110? score less than 80?  Solution:  Because \\(90=100-10\\) and \\(110=100+10\\) are both one standard deviation from the mean, \\(68\\)% of people would be expected to score between \\(90\\) and \\(110.\\) \\(80=100-2\\times10\\) is two standard deviations below the mean. We know that 95% of scores fall between \\(80\\) and \\(120\\) so \\(5\\)% must fall outside this range. Half of these, \\(2.5\\)%, will be below \\(80\\). Therefore we would expect that \\(2.5\\)% of people to have IQ scores less than \\(80\\).     Exercises 1. Scores on a general achievement test are normally distributed with a mean of \\(80\\) and a standard deviation of \\(15\\). Adam scored \\(95\\). What proportion of students had a higher score than Adam?  2. The actual weights of cereal boxes that are supposed to contain \\(500g\\) are normally distributed with mean of \\(510g\\) and a standard deviation of \\(5g\\). What proportion of boxes are under-filled?  3. In a maths class the bottom \\(16\\)% of students are given an F grade. If the class mean is \\(63\\) and the standard deviation is \\(18\\) what score must a student get to pass?  4. If newborn birth weights in a certain hospital are normally distributed with a mean of \\(3200g\\) and a standard deviation of \\(400g\\)  what percentage of babies weigh more than \\(3200g\\)? what percentage of babies weigh between \\(2400g\\) and \\(4000g\\)? what percentage of babies weigh less than \\(3600g\\)? if the \\(16\\)% of babies with the lowest birth weights are placed in the special care nursery will a baby that weighs \\(2500g\\) need special care?   5. \\(95\\)% of people in a clinical study had systolic blood pressure readings between \\(116\\) and \\(144\\).

The coefficient of the \\(x^{2}\\) term is \\(6\\) which has factors \\[\\begin{align*} 6 &amp; =6\\times1\\\\ &amp; =2\\times3. \\end{align*}\\] So we are looking for a factorisation such as: \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(6x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+6xn+mx-8\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+\\left(6n+m\\right)x-8 &amp; \\left(8.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(3x+m\\right)\\left(2x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+3xn+2mx-8\\\\ &amp; =6x^{2}+\\left(3n+2m\\right)x-8 &amp; \\left(8.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] In both cases, \\(mn=-8.\\) So we have the possibilities \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =-8 &amp; n &amp; =1\\\\ m &amp; =8 &amp; n &amp; =-1\\\\ m &amp; =4 &amp; n &amp; =-2\\\\ m &amp; =-4 &amp; n &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor eqn \\(\\left(8.1\\right)\\) we know that \\(6n+m=13\\). This is not satisfied by any of the \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) values above.\n\nFor eqn \\(\\left(8.2\\right)\\) we know that \\(3n+2m=13\\). This is satisfied by \\(m=8\\) and \\(n=-1\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} 6x^{2}+13x-8 &amp; =\\left(3x+8\\right)\\left(2x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nExample 9\nFactorise \\(4x^{2}+4x+1\\)\nSolution\nIn this case there are no numbers that divide into each term as we had in Example 7 above. The coefficient of the \\(x^{2}\\) term is \\(4\\) which has factors \\[\\begin{align*} 4 &amp; =4\\times1\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nSo we are looking for a factorisation such as: \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(4x+m\\right)\\left(x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+4xn+mx+mn\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+\\left(4n+m\\right)x+1 &amp; \\left(9.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x+m\\right)\\left(2x+n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+2xn+2mx+mn\\\\ &amp; =4x^{2}+\\left(2n+2m\\right)x+1 &amp; \\left(9.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(mn=1\\). That means \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =1 &amp; n= &amp; 1 &amp; \\left(9.3\\right)\\\\ m &amp; =-1 &amp; n= &amp; -1. &amp; \\left(9.4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Suppose eqn \\(\\left(9.1\\right)\\) is correct then \\(\\left(4n+m\\right)=4.\\) But this is not possible with the choices for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in \\(\\left(9.3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(9.4\\right)\\). Hence the factorisation must be as in eqn \\(\\left(9.2\\right)\\) with \\(2n+2m=4.\\) The latter is achieved with \\(\\left(9.3\\right)\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x+1\\right)\\left(2x+1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe approach given in examples 6-9 is okay provided there are not too many factors for \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). If the number of factors is excessive, we can employ other methods.\n\n\n\n\nWhen can you get real linear factors for a quadratic?\nIn Example 5 above we found that we could not get real linear factors for \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}+3a+6 &amp; . \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThis raises the question of when real solutions to general quadratics may be found. The most general quadratic has the form 4 Note that the graph of \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =ax^{2}+bx+c \\end{align*}\\] is a parabola.  \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; . \\end{align*}\\]\n\nTo determine if there are real linear factors, we introduce the discriminant.\n\nThe discriminant\nThe discriminant denoted \\(\\Delta,\\) for the general quadratic \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c \\end{align*}\\] is \\[\\begin{align*} \\Delta &amp; =b^{2}-4ac. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nIf \\[\\begin{align*} \\Delta &amp; =\\begin{cases} 0\\text{ there is one repeated linear factor}\\\\ &gt;0\\text{ there are two distinct linear factors}\\\\ &lt;0\\text{ there are no real linear factors.} \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] The discriminant tells us how many real roots there are to the equation 5 Geometrically, the discriminant tells us how many times the graph of \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =ax^{2}+bx+c \\end{align*}\\] intersects the \\(x-\\)axis. If \\(\\Delta=0\\), the graph just touches the \\(x-\\)axis at one point. If \\(\\Delta&gt;0,\\) the graph intersects the \\(x-\\)axis at two points. If \\(\\Delta&lt;0,\\) the graph does not intersect the \\(x-\\)axis. \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c=0 &amp; . \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nExample 10\nFactorise (if possible) \\(x^{2}+6x+12\\)\nSolution\nIn this case: \\(a=1\\) , \\(b=+6\\) , \\(c=+12\\) therefore\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\Delta &amp; =\\left(b^{2}-4ac\\right)\\\\ &amp; =36-4(1)(12)\\\\ &amp; =36-48\\\\ &amp; =-12\\\\ &amp; &lt;0. \\end{align*}\\] The discriminant is negative therefore \\(x^{2}+6x+12\\) has no real factors.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nFactorise the following expressions (if possible):\n\n\\(\\text{a)$\\ x^{2}+10x+21\\qquad\\text{b)$\\ z^{2}+11z+18\\qquad\\text{c)$\\ x^{2}+5x-14$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\\(\\text{d)$\\ m^{2}-m-72\\qquad\\text{e)$\\ x^{2}+6x+9\\qquad\\text{f)$\\ a^{2}-15a+44$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\\(\\text{g)$\\ x^{2}-2x-24\\qquad\\text{h)$\\ y^{2}-10y+16\\qquad\\text{i)$\\ z^{2}+4z-60$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\\(\\text{j)$\\ n^{2}+6n-16\\qquad\\text{k)$\\ a^{2}+5a+10\\qquad\\text{l)$\\ s^{2}+2s-48$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\\(\\text{m)$\\ y^{2}+7y+19\\qquad\\text{n)$\\ x^{2}+16x+39\\qquad\\text{o)$\\ x^{2}-14x+45$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nFactorise the following if possible.\n\n\\(\\text{a)$\\ 5x^{2}+13x+6\\qquad\\text{b)$\\ 2x^{2}+x-15\\qquad\\text{c)$\\ 3m^{2}-m-2$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\\(\\text{d)$\\ 3y^{2}-10y+8\\qquad\\text{e)$\\ 2a^{2}+11a+12\\qquad\\text{f)$\\ 6x^{2}-11x+5$ }$ }$ }\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this page, A3.4 Factorisation: Quadratics (PDF 258 KB) \n\n","excerpt":"Image: Pixabay Quadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\).

Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. Let's factorise a quadratic into two linear factors using the \"completing the square\" method. This is a general method that allows any quadratic to be factorised. For example \\[x^2+8x-5 = \\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA perfect square is of the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}-2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\n\nConsider, the expression \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx. \\end{align*}\\] To make this a perfect square, according to eqn \\(\\left(1\\right),\\) you have to add \\(b^{2}\\). But if you add \\(b^{2}\\) you must also take it away to preserve equality. That is, given \\(x^{2}+2bx\\) we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}-b^{2}. &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\n\nNote that the amount we added and subtracted is one half of the \\(x\\) coefficient squared. That is,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left(\\frac{2b}{2}\\right)^{2} &amp; =b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nIf you look at the right hand side of eqn \\(\\left(3\\right)\\)we have added \\(b^{2}-b^{2}=0\\) so the value is unchanged. However we can now group the terms to get:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}\\right)-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Using eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above the term in brackets on the right hand side is \\(\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}\\)and so using the difference of two squares formula (DOTS) 1 The difference of two squares formula states that \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}-b^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Note that the order of the factors on the right hand side does not matter.  \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}-b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+b-b\\right)\\left(x+b+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =x\\left(x+2b\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\nAt first this might seem like a lot of work for very little gain. After all, it is pretty obvious that \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =x\\left(x+2b\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nCompleting the square\nThe advantage of completing the square comes in when we have to factorise something like \\(x^{2}+2bx+c\\) where \\(c\\) is a real number. In order to do this we follow the above procedure and the results are magical! The following examples illustrate this.\n\nExample 1\nFactorise \\(x^{2}+8x-5\\) by completing the square.\nSolution\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it. We then add and subtract it from the right hand side to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+8x-5 &amp; =x^{2}+8x-5+\\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right)^{2}\\quad\\text{(add the square of half the $x\\text{ coefficient and subtract it)}$ }\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+8x-5+\\left(4\\right)^{2}-\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}+8x+\\left(4\\right)^{2}-5-\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\ (\\text{regroup the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+8x+\\left(4\\right)^{2}\\right)-5-16\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4\\right)^{2}-21\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{21}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where, in the last line, we used the DOTS rule.\n\n\n\nExample 2\nFactorise \\(x^{2}-6x-4\\) by completing the square.\nSolution\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it.

We cannot apply the DOTS rule because we have the SUM of two squares not the DIFFERENCE. So in this case the quadratic \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not have any real factors and solutions. Complex factors and solutions do exist but are not considered in this module.2 Geometrically this means that the graph of \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not intersect the \\(x-\\) axis. The graph is shown below\n\n\nSee Exercise 1 below.\n\n\n\n\nCompleting the square when the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is not one\nIn this section we consider the completing the square method on quadratics of the form \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\) where \\(a\\neq1.\\) In this case we simply divide the quadratic by \\(a\\) and proceed as above. That is we write\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =a\\left[x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and complete the square on the RHS term in the square brackets. Don\u2019t forget to include the \\(a\\) in the final result!\n\nExample 4\nFactorise \\(2x^{2}-10x+2\\).\nSolution\nDivide the quadratic by \\(2\\) and write \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-\\frac{10}{2}x+\\frac{2}{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now complete the square on the quadratic in square brackets on the RHS, \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\quad\\text{(add the square of half the $x\\text{ coefficient and subtract it)}$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+\\frac{25}{4}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ (\\text{regrouping the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{21}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\right]\\ \\text{using DOTS rule}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\n\nSee Exercise 2 below.\n\n\n\n\nCompleting the square and the quadratic formula\nThis section is beyond the intent of this module and may be skipped if you are not interested.\n\nYou may be aware of the quadratic formula.

But what is that point? A value to many decimal places can be very long, to define a value that is very precise. The precise point can be infinitely small.  We can only ask what the value of the curve is as we get closer to that point, from values above and from values below. That is what we mean by approaching the limit.  This short maths video demonstrates the limit of a function which describes the behaviour of this function in the vicinity of a particular value of the variable, which is usually x.      Definition If the value of the function as we approach a particular value \\(x=a\\) is the same whether we are approaching from the left or the right then the limit exists. The function need not be continuous or even defined at the point of interest. For the function below, the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(2\\) is \\(4\\).  We say, \\[ \\lim_{x\\rightarrow2}f(x)=4. \\]   Examples  Find the limit of the function \\(f(x)=x+2\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(2.\\)  Solution: The behaviour of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2 is shown in the table:    \\(x\\) 1.95 1.995 \\(\\dashrightarrow\\) 2 \\(\\dashleftarrow\\) 2.005 2.05     \\(f(x)\\) 3.95 3.995 \\(\\dashrightarrow\\) 4 \\(\\dashleftarrow\\) 4.005 4.05    The table shows that as \\(x\\) approaches 2, \\(f(x)\\) approaches 4 Alternatively, because this function is defined at \\(x=2,\\) we could substitute \\(x=2\\) into the function: \\[ f(2)=2+2=4 \\] Therefore \\[ \\lim_{x\\rightarrow2}\\left(x+2\\right)=4. \\]  Find \\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\)(\\(5x^{2}+2xh+h\\)) .  Solution: The 2\\(xh\\) and \\(h\\) terms will approach zero as \\(h\\) approaches zero. The limit can be found by substituting zero for \\(h\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}(5x^{2}+2xh+h) &amp; =5x^{2}+2\\times0+0\\\\ &amp; =5x^{2} \\end{align*}\\]  Find \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow1}\\) \\(\\tfrac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}\\).  Solution: It is not possible to find the limit by substituting \\(x=1\\) as we would then have \\(0\\) in the denominator. We can find this limit, if we simplify the expression first and then substitute.1 You need to know the difference of two squares, \\[ a^{2}-b^{2}=\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right). \\] Applying this gives: \\[ x^{2}-1=\\left(x-1\\right)\\left(x+1\\right). \\] In this case \\[\\begin{align*} \\lim_{x\\rightarrow1}\\tfrac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} &amp; =\\lim_{x\\rightarrow1}\\tfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{x\\rightarrow1}x+1\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]  Find \\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\sin\\left(h\\right)\/h\\).  Solution: It is not possible to find the limit by substituting \\(h=0\\). But consider the behaviour of \\(f(h)=\\frac{\\sin(h)}{h}\\) as \\(h\\rightarrow0\\):    \\(h\\) -0.5 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.01 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5     \\(f(h)\\) 0.959 0.985 0.993 0.998 ? 0.99998 0.998 0.993 0.985 0.959    It appears that \\[ \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\sin(h)}{h}=1. \\]   Exercises Determine the following limits: \\(1)\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\left(4xh+2\\right)\\) \\(2)\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{9-x^{2}}{4}\\) \\(3)\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{xh-2h}{h}\\) \\(4)\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\tan(x)}{x}\\)       Download this page, D1 Limits (PDF 208KB)  What's next...

Using this method is the best way to understand the concepts around differentiation. Start here to really appreciate what you are doing when you differentiate, before you start differentiating using other methods in later modules.  Definition The derivative of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is denoted by \\(f'\\left(x\\right)\\) and is defined as \\[ f'(x)=\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},h\\text{$\\neq$ }0. \\] Using this definition is called differentiating from first principles. The result \\(f'\\left(x\\right)\\), is called the derivative of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\). There are rules for differentiation that are far more convenient than using the definition above. In general, you should only use the first principles approach above if you are asked to. This module provides some examples on differentiation from first principles.       Example 1 If \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2},\\) find the derivative of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) from first principles. Solution Using first principles,1 You need to know the identity \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2} \\end{align*}\\] for this example. In general, you need to know a bit of algebra to do limits effectively.  \\[\\begin{align*} f'(x) &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},h\\text{$\\neq$ }0\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{(x+h)^{2}-x^{2}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{x^{2}+2xh+h^{2}-x^{2}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{2xh+h^{2}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{h(2x+h)}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}2x+h\\\\ &amp; =2x. \\end{align*}\\] The derivative of \\(x^{2}=2x.\\)   Example 2 Determine, from first principles, the gradient function for the curve \\(f(x)=2x^{2}-x\\) and calculate its value at \\(x=3\\). Solution Using first principles, \\[\\begin{align*} f'(x) &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}h\\text{$\\neq$ }0\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{2(x+h)^{2}-(x+h)-(2x^{2}-x)}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{2x^{2}+4xh+2h^{2}-x-h-2x^{2}+x)}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{4xh+2h^{2}-h)}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}4x+2h-1\\\\ &amp; =4x-1. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient function is \\(f'(x)=4x-1.\\) It\u2019s value at \\(x=3\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(3\\right) &amp; =4\\left(3\\right)-1\\\\ &amp; =11. \\end{align*}\\] The value of the gradient function at \\(x=3\\) is \\(11.\\)   Example 3 Use differentiation from first principles to find the gradient function of \\(y=\\frac{1}{x}\\). Solution Using first principles, \\[\\begin{align*} f'(x) &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},h\\text{$\\neq$ }0\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\frac{1}{x+h}-\\frac{1}{x}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\frac{x}{x(x+h)}-\\frac{x+h}{x(x+h)}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\frac{x-(x+h)}{x(x+h)}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\frac{-h}{x(x+h)}}{h}\\\\ &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{-1}{x(x+h)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-1}{x^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient function of \\(y=\\frac{1}{x}\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\). In this case we can write \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dy}{dx} &amp; =-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises Find the derivative of the following functions using differentiation from first principles.  \\(f\\left(x\\right)=3x.\\) \\(f(x)=5x^{2}\\) \\(f\\left(x\\right)=2x^{2}-1\/x\\)     Download this page, D3 Differentiation from first principles (PDF 241KB)  What's next...

A linear equation has one unknown variable and may be solved by transposing the equation to make the variable the subject of the equation. For example, the equation \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(2x-7\\right) &amp; =-15 \\end{align*}\\] may be transposed to get \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Transposition involves changing the equation via operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This module discusses techniques for solving linear equations by transposition.  Simple Equations The essential point is that in solving an equation, what you do to one side must be done to the other side. If you add, subtract, multiply or divide one side of the equation by a number you must do the same to the other side. This preserves equality.  Example 1 Solve \\(m+4=-2\\). Solution: We want to make \\(m\\) the subject of the equation.  1 When a variable is the only term on one side of the equal sign we call it the subject. For example the formula for the area of a circle is \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\pi r^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] In this case the variable \\(A\\) is the subject.  \\[\\begin{align*} m+4 &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] To get \\(m\\) on its own we need to take \\(4\\) from both sides to get:  2 Remember that what you do to one side of an equation must be done to the other side to preserve equality. \\[\\begin{align*} m+4-4 &amp; =-2-4\\\\ m &amp; =-6. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(m=4.\\) Note that you can always check your solution by substituting your answer into the original equation. In this case3 LHS and RHS are abbreviations for left hand side and right hand side respectively. \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =m+4\\\\ &amp; =-6+4\\\\ &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.   Example 2 Solve \\(p-2=5\\). Solution: We want to make \\(p\\) the subject. To do this we add \\(2\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} p-2 &amp; =5\\\\ p-2+2 &amp; =5+2\\\\ p &amp; =7. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(p=7.\\)   Example 3 Solve \\(3g=18.\\) Solution: To make \\(g\\) the subject we need to divide both sides by \\(3\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 3g &amp; =18\\\\ \\frac{3g}{3} &amp; =\\frac{18}{3}\\\\ g &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(g=6.\\)   Example 4 Solve \\(y\/4=12.\\) Solution: To make \\(y\\) the subject we multiply both sides by \\(4\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{4} &amp; =12\\\\ \\frac{y}{4}\\times4 &amp; =12\\times4\\\\ y &amp; =48. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(y=48.\\)    More Complex Equations Some guidelines are:  With more complex equations it is necessary to perform several operations. As you become more experienced, you may perform several operations in one step. If the variable appears in terms on both sides of the equation, you need to get these terms to one side of the equation and then solve for the variable. If an equation involves brackets, the brackets should be expanded first. If an equation involves fractions, you need to use a common denominator.  These ideas are illustrated in the following examples. Note that the strategy in the examples below is not part of the solution. It is the basic plan to solve the equation. You do NOT need to provide a strategy when solving problems. Nor do you need to describe each step. The strategy and description of each step is used below to show you the thinking that leads to the solution and the steps involved.  Example 5 Solve \\(2w-3=-17.\\) Strategy: We want to make \\(w\\) the subject. We do this in two steps. First we get \\(2w\\) on its own then divide by two to get \\(w\\) as the subject. That is we add \\(3\\) to both sides and then divide both sides by \\(2\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2w-3 &amp; =-17\\\\ 2w-3+3 &amp; =-17+3\\\\ 2w &amp; =-14\\\\ \\frac{2w}{2} &amp; =-\\frac{14}{2}\\\\ w &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(w=-7.\\) With more complex equations, it is a good idea to check your result. However, this is not necessary unless you are asked to check. In this example, \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2w-3\\\\ &amp; =2\\times\\left(-7\\right)-3\\\\ &amp; =-14-3\\\\ &amp; =-17\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.   Example 6 Solve: \\(\\frac{3d}{4}+5=7.\\) Strategy: First get the term involving \\(d\\) on its own by subtracting five from both sides, then solve for \\(d.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3d}{4}+5 &amp; =7\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}+5-5 &amp; =7-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $5\\text{ from both sides)}$ }\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4} &amp; =2\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}\\times4 &amp; =2\\times4\\quad\\text{(multiply both sides by $4$ )}\\\\ 3d &amp; =8\\\\ \\frac{3d}{3} &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $3)$ }\\\\ d &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Solution is \\(d=8\/3.\\) We can check the solution (but this is not necessary) as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =\\frac{3d}{4}+5\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{3}+5\\\\ &amp; =2+5\\\\ &amp; =7\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.   Example 7: Variable on Both Sides Solve \\(3c+1=c-5\\). Strategy: First get all the \\(c\\) terms on one side then solve for \\(c\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3c+1 &amp; =c-5\\\\ 3c-c+1 &amp; =c-c-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $c$ from both sides to get $c$ terms to one side)}\\\\ 2c+1 &amp; =-5\\\\ 2c+1-1 &amp; =-5-1\\quad\\text{(subtract $1$ from both sides)}\\\\ 2c &amp; =-6\\\\ c &amp; =-3\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $2$ )}. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(c=-3.\\) Check (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3c+1\\\\ &amp; =3\\left(-3\\right)+1\\\\ &amp; =-8.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =c-5\\\\ &amp; =-3-5\\\\ &amp; =-8\\\\ &amp; =\\text{LHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.   Example 8: Brackets Solve \\(3(5-2j)=33.\\) Strategy: First remove brackets and solve using the techniques shown above. Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3(5-2j) &amp; =33\\\\ 15-6j &amp; =33\\quad\\text{ (remove brackets) }\\\\ -6j &amp; =33-15\\quad\\text{(subract $15$ from both sides)}\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ j &amp; =\\frac{18}{-6}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $-6$ )}\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(j=-3.\\) Check (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3(5-2j)\\\\ &amp; =15-6\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =15+18\\\\ &amp; =33\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.   Example 9: Brackets and Variable on Both Sides Solve \\(2(3k-2)=5\\left(k+7\\right).\\) Strategy: Remove brackets, get the variable on one side and then solve using the techniques shown above. Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2(3k-2) &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ 6k-4 &amp; =5k+35\\\\ 6k-5k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k &amp; =35+4\\\\ &amp; =39.\\\\ \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(k=39\\). Check (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2\\left(3k-2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6k-4\\\\ &amp; =6\\times39-4\\\\ &amp; =230.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\left(39+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\times46\\\\ &amp; =230\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.   Example 10: Fractions Solve \\(\\frac{h+1}{3}=\\frac{h}{4}\\). Strategy: Multiply both sides of the equation by a common denominator and solve using the techniques shown above. In this case a common denominator is \\(12.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{h+1}{3} &amp; =\\frac{h}{4}\\\\ \\left(\\frac{h+1}{3}\\right)\\times12 &amp; =\\frac{h}{4}\\times12\\\\ 4\\left(h+1\\right) &amp; =3h\\\\ 4h-3h+4 &amp; =0\\\\ h+4 &amp; =0\\\\ h &amp; =-4. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(h=-4.\\) Check (note required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =\\frac{h+1}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-4+1}{3}\\\\ &amp; =-1\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =\\frac{h}{4}\\\\ &amp; =-1\\\\ &amp; =\\text{LHS} \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.   Example 11 Solve \\(\\frac{2z+11}{7}=\\frac{z-3}{12}\\). Strategy: A common denominator is \\(84.\\) So we multiply both sides by \\(84\\) and solve using the techniques shown above. Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2z+11}{7} &amp; =\\frac{z-3}{12}\\\\ \\left(\\frac{2z+11}{7}\\right)\\times84 &amp; =\\left(\\frac{z-3}{12}\\right)\\times84\\\\ 12\\left(2z+11\\right) &amp; =7\\left(z-3\\right)\\\\ 24z+132 &amp; =7z-21\\\\ 24z-7z+132 &amp; =-21\\\\ 17z+132 &amp; =-21\\\\ 17z &amp; =-21-132\\\\ &amp; =-153\\\\ z &amp; =\\frac{-153}{17}\\\\ &amp; =-9. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(z=-9.\\) Note that in this example, we have not put in all the details and explanation. This is what you should aim to do.   Example 12 Solve \\(\\frac{3u}{4}-\\frac{1}{3}=7\\). Strategy: A common denominator is \\(12.\\) So we multiply both sides by \\(12\\) and solve using the techniques shown above. Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3u}{4}-\\frac{1}{3} &amp; =7\\\\ \\left(\\frac{3u}{4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\times12 &amp; =7\\times12\\\\ \\frac{3u}{4}\\times12-\\frac{1}{3}\\times12 &amp; =84\\\\ 9u-4 &amp; =84\\\\ 9u &amp; =88\\\\ u &amp; =\\frac{88}{9}. \\end{align*}\\] The last example is important as it shows that the solution may not be a whole number as in the previous examples.    Exercise 1 Solve the following equations. \\[\\begin{array}{llrclllccc} a) &amp; x+3=7 &amp; &amp; &amp; b) &amp; 5-j=-2 &amp; &amp; &amp; c) &amp; 3c=12\\\\ \\\\ d) &amp; -r=-12 &amp; &amp; &amp; e) &amp; \\frac{m}{2}=-7 &amp; &amp; &amp; f) &amp; -8u=12\\\\ \\\\ g) &amp; 4g+4=16 &amp; &amp; &amp; h) &amp; 7-2w=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; i) &amp; \\frac{e}{2}-5=-8\\\\ \\\\ j) &amp; 21-3t=12 &amp; &amp; &amp; k) &amp; \\frac{y}{5}-9=-5 &amp; &amp; &amp; l) &amp; 3-\\frac{u}{2}=-7 \\end{array}\\]      Exercise 2 Solve these equations. \\[\\begin{array}{llrclllccc} a) &amp; 5i+2=i+10 &amp; &amp; &amp; b) &amp; 10p-11=2p-3 &amp; &amp; &amp; c) &amp; 5a-12=3a+6\\\\ \\\\ d) &amp; 10d+10=0 &amp; &amp; &amp; e) &amp; f+6=6f-9 &amp; &amp; &amp; f) &amp; 8-g=5g+14\\\\ \\\\ g) &amp; 5h-2=7h-12 &amp; &amp; &amp; h) &amp; 6j+13=4j+13 \\end{array}\\]      Exercise 3 Solve \\[\\begin{array}{llrclllccc} a) &amp; 3(2k-4)=18 &amp; &amp; &amp; b) &amp; 5(2z+9)=15 &amp; &amp; &amp; c) &amp; 3(x+4)=6\\\\ \\\\ d) &amp; 3(c+3)+2(c-5)=4 &amp; &amp; &amp; e) &amp; 3(2v-3)+2(v-4)=-25 &amp; &amp; &amp; f) &amp; 3(b+4)=2(4b+1) \\end{array}\\]      Exercise 4 Solve \\[\\begin{array}{llrclllccc} a) &amp; \\frac{9n}{5}-4=5 &amp; &amp; &amp; b) &amp; \\frac{4m}{3}-11=9 &amp; &amp; &amp; c) &amp; 1-\\frac{9q}{2}=-8\\\\ \\\\ d) &amp; \\frac{w-4}{2}=2 &amp; &amp; &amp; e) &amp; \\frac{3-2e}{11}=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; f) &amp; \\frac{3r+9}{5}=-3\\\\ \\\\ g) &amp; \\frac{3t}{8}+4=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; h) &amp; \\frac{y}{3}=\\frac{2}{9} &amp; &amp; &amp; i) &amp; \\frac{5u-4}{4}=\\frac{u-5}{5}\\\\ \\\\ j) &amp; \\frac{2i+1}{7}=\\frac{3i-5}{4} &amp; &amp; &amp; k) &amp; \\frac{p+1}{3}+1=4 &amp; &amp; &amp; l) &amp; 2-\\frac{5a-4}{4}=4\\\\ \\\\ m) &amp; \\frac{d-3}{3}-4=\\frac{d-2}{2} &amp; &amp; &amp; n) &amp; \\frac{1-m}{5}-m=\\frac{2m-1}{2} \\end{array}\\]       Download this pdf document: ES1 Linear Equations (PDF 177 KB)   What's next...

When a number such as 16 is written in the form 42\u202f(which means 4 x 4) we say that it is written as an exponential, or in index notation. There are laws about multiplying and dividing indices as well as how to deal with negative indices.  This module introduces rules for multiplying and dividing expressions using index notation. For example how to simplify expressions like \\(4a^{3}b\\times3ab^{5}\\) or \\(9a^{3}b^{2}c\\div3ab^{5}\\). We do not consider fractional indices which are covered in a different module. The plural of index is indices. Here's a video showing how the rules work:      Index Notation Consider the following examples: \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{4} &amp; =3\\times3\\times3\\times3=81\\\\ 5^{3} &amp; =5\\times5\\times5=125\\\\ 2^{7} &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2=128 \\end{align*}\\] In general: \\[ a^{n}=\\underbrace{a\\times a\\times a\\times\\ldots\\times a}_{n\\textrm{ factors}} \\] The letter \\(n\\) in \\(a^{n}\\) is referred to in one of three ways:  \\(n\\) is the index in \\(a^{n}\\) with \\(a\\) known as the base. \\(n\\) is the exponent or power to which the base \\(a\\) is raised. \\(n\\) is the logarithm, with \\(a\\) as the base. (see the Logarithms module)  When a number such as \\(125\\) is written in the form \\(5^{3}\\) we say it is written as an exponential or in index notation. Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions written in index notation is achieved using index laws.   Index Laws This section states and gives examples of universal index laws.  First Index Law To multiply index expressions you add the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{3}\\times2^{2} &amp; =\\left(2\\times2\\times2\\right)\\times\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\\\ &amp; =2^{5} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(2^{3}\\times2^{2}=2^{3+2}=2^{5}\\). In general:   First Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n} \\]     Second Index Law To divide expressions subtract the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{5}\\div3^{3} &amp; =\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3\\times3\\times3\\times3}{3\\times3\\times3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3}{1}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling three lots of 3}\\\\ &amp; =3^{2} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(3^{5}\\div3^{3}=\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}=3^{5-3}=3^{2}.\\) In general:   Second Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\div a^{n}=\\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}}=a^{m-n},\\quad a\\neq0 \\]   Note that expressions in index form can only be multiplied or divided if they have the same base.   Third Index Law To raise an expression in index form to a power, multiply the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\\\ &amp; =5^{2+2+2}\\quad\\textrm{using the first index law}\\\\ &amp; =5^{6} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3}=5^{2\\times3}=5^{6}.\\) In general:   Third Index Law: \\[ \\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{m\\times n} \\]   This also leads to the expression: \\[\\begin{align*} (a^{m}b^{p})^{n} &amp; =a^{mn}b^{pn} \\end{align*}\\] Be careful as this is true for multiplication and division only , not addition or subtraction , so that \\((a+b)^{n}\\neq a^{n}+b^{n}\\)    Examples of Index Laws  Simplify \\(x^{5}\\times x^{6}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{5}\\times x^{6} &amp; =x^{5+6}\\quad\\textrm{by the first law}\\\\ &amp; =x^{11} \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(a^{5}\\div a^{3}.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} a^{5}\\div a^{3} &amp; =\\frac{a^{5}}{a^{3}}=a^{5-3}\\quad\\textrm{by the second law}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2} \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(\\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4} &amp; =c^{3\\times4}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =c^{12} \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(\\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =2^{3}\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{2\\times3}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{6} \\end{align*}\\]  Note that terms with different bases must be considered seperately when using the index laws , such as \\((2a^{3}b^{2})^{4}=2^{4}a^{12}b^{8}\\) Exercise 1 provides practice for these laws.   Zero Index So far we have only considered expressions in which each index is a positive whole number1 Whole numbers are called integers and positive whole numbers are called the positive integers.. The index laws also apply if the index is zero, negative or a fraction (fractional indices will be dealt with in another module). Consider \\(2^{3}\\div2^{3}=\\frac{2^{3}}{2^{3}}=\\frac{2\\times2\\times2}{2\\times2\\times2}=\\frac{8}{8}=8\\div8=1\\). Using the second law, \\(2^{3}\\div2^{3}=2^{3-3}=2^{0}\\) therefore \\(1=2^{0}\\). In general any expression with a zero index is equal to 1. Also note that \\(0^{0}\\) is ambiguous and so we don\u2019t allow \\(a=0\\) in this law.   Zero law of indices: \\[ a^{0}=1,\\qquad a\\neq0 \\]    Examples of the Zero Index Law \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 7^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(xy\\right)^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0}=1 &amp; &amp; \\left(28x^{2}\\right)^{0}=1\\\\ \\end{array}\\]    Negative Indices Consider \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{0}\\div2^{4} &amp; =\\frac{2^{0}}{2^{4}}\\quad\\textrm{remember that $2^{0}=1$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2^{4}}. \\end{align*}\\] But \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{0}\\div2^{4} &amp; =2^{0-4}\\quad\\textrm{using the second law}\\\\ &amp; =2^{-4}. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}=2^{-4}\\) and \\(2^{0}\\div2^{4}=\\frac{1}{2^{4}}\\) therefore \\(2^{-4}=\\frac{1}{2^{4}}\\). In general2 Note that \\(1\/0\\) is undefined and so \\(a\\neq0\\) in the law below.,   \\[ a^{-n}=\\frac{1}{a^{n}}\\textrm{ which also leads to $\\frac{1}{a^{-n}}=a^{n},\\qquad a\\neq0$ } \\]    Examples of Negative Indices \\[\\begin{array}{lllll} 1. \\ \\ 2^{-3}=\\frac{1}{8} &amp; &amp; 2. \\ \\ \\frac{1}{x}=x^{-1} &amp; &amp; 3. \\ \\ 2y^{-1}=\\frac{2}{y}\\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ 4. \\ \\ \\frac{1}{3x^{-2}}=\\frac{x^{2}}{3} &amp; &amp; 5. \\ \\ \\frac{1}{\\left(-2a\\right)^{-3}}=\\left(-2a\\right)^{3} &amp; &amp; 6. \\ \\ 5ab^{-4}=\\frac{5a}{b^{4}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\] Exercise 2 provides practice on zero and negative indices.    Summary of Index Laws The following laws should be remembered.

For example the equation \\(\\log_{e}\\frac{N}{N_{0}}\\approx-\\lambda t\\) is used to describe radioactive decay. The laws for working with logarithms enable us to solve equations that cannot be solved with other algebraic techniques.      Definition The logarithm of a number is the power to which the base must be raised to produce the number. This means that a logarithm (or log) is an index. Every index or log expression contains a number, a base and an index. For example:  And we say \" eight is equal to two to the power of three\". This statement has an equivalent logarithmic form and may be written as:  We say \u201cthe log to base two of eight is equal to three\u201d (the power of two that gives eight is three). Generally, providing \\(a&gt;0,\\ n&gt;0\\) and \\(a\\neq1\\), \\[ a^{x}=n\\Leftrightarrow\\log_{a}n=x \\]   Logarithms and the Calculator While any positive number except one can be the base of a logarithm, \\(10\\) and \\(e\\) are most common. To find the power of \\(10\\) that produces \\(50\\) we use the LOG button on the calculator: \\(\\log_{10}50\\approx1.7\\) and \\(10^{1.7}\\approx50\\). To find the power of \\(e\\) that produces \\(50\\) we use the LN button on the calculator: \\(\\log_{e}50=\\ln50\\approx3.9\\) and \\(e^{3.9}\\approx50\\).

What Does the Coefficient Matrix Tell Us? The coefficient matrix can be used to find information about the number of solutions to a system of equations. For any system of equations, if the coefficient matrix is:  Singular (that is the determinant \\(=0\\)) there will be an infinite number of solutions or no solutions. Non-singular (determinant \\(\\neq0\\)) there will be a unique solution.     Infinitely Many Solutions  Example 1 Consider the system of equations \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+3y &amp; =4\\\\ -x-y+2z &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] The augmented matrix for this system is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 4\\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Using elementary row operations we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-R_{1}\\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Row \\(3\\) tells us that \\(0x+0y+0z=0.\\) This is true for any value of \\(x,y\\) or \\(z.\\) So we are able to set any one of these variables to some number \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).1 It can only be one variable as there other equations to be satisfied in \\(R_{2}\\) and \\(R_{1}.\\) For this example,2 Even though we set \\(z=t,\\) we could set either \\(x=t\\) or \\(y=t\\). We still get a solution to the system of equations but it will look different. we set \\(z=t.\\) From \\(R_{2}\\) and substituting \\(t\\) for \\(z\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y+z &amp; =1\\\\ y+t &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =1-t. \\end{align*}\\] Now from \\(R_{1}\\), substituting \\(z=t,\\,y=1-t\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+2\\left(1-t\\right)-t &amp; =3\\\\ x+2-2t-t &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =1+3t. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution is \\(x=1+3t,\\,y=1-t\\) and \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).3 As there are an infinite number of choices for \\(t,\\) there are an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations.  In general if the reduced augmented matrix has one or more rows of zeros, there will be an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations.4 You may recall that the determinant of a matrix with a row of zeros is zero. Hence the matrix is singular.   Example 2 Consider the system of equations \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ 2x+4y-2z &amp; =6\\\\ -5x-10y+5z &amp; =-15 \\end{align*}\\] The augmented matrix for this system is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; -2\\\\ -5 &amp; -10 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 6\\\\ -15 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Using elementary row operations we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+5R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We have only one equation and three unknowns. In this case we must let two of the three variables be free. For example, we set \\(z=t\\), where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(y=s,\\) where \\(s\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) .5 It doesn\u2019t matter which two variables are selected to be a parameter \\(s\\) or \\(t.\\) We could set \\(x=s\\) and \\(y=t.\\) Substituting in row \\(1\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} s+2t-z &amp; =3\\\\ z &amp; =s+2t-3. \\end{align*}\\] While this looks different to the solution at left, it is still a valid solution to the set of equations. Substituting into \\(R_{1}\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+2s-t &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =3-2s+t. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution is \\(x=3-2s+t,\\,y=s,\\,z=t\\) where \\(s\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).

This module shows three different ways to calculate a number to represent the spread of a set of data.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Statistics\n\n\n\n    Measuring Spread or Dispersion in Data Consider the two sets of values below: Set A: \\(4,4,5,5,5,6,6\\). Set B: \\(1,3,4,5,6,7,9\\). Both groups A and B have mean = median = \\(5\\) but the data sets are quite different. The values in Set A are less spread out than those in Set B.  Range To compare data sets it is also useful to look at the measure of spread. The most basic measure of spread is the range, the distance from the smallest to the largest value. Set A \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Range} &amp; =\\text{highest value$-\\text{lowest value}$ }\\\\ &amp; =6-4\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Set B \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Range} &amp; =\\text{highest value$-\\text{lowest value}$ }\\\\ &amp; =9-1\\\\ &amp; =8. \\end{align*}\\] We can see that Set B has greater spread than Set A. But the problem with the range is that it uses only two of the values in the data set. One of these may be an odd or unusual value called an outlier. Consider the two sets of values below: Set Y: \\(1,1,2,2,2,2,2,100\\). Set Z: \\(1,18,23,41,59,63,87,100\\). The range for both is 99 because Set Y has one unusual value - the 100. Most of the data are ones or twos. The value of 100 is unusual and is an outlier.   Interquartile Range The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the distance between the first quartile Q\\(_{1}\\) and the third quartile Q\\(_{3}\\). IQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}\\) The first and third quartiles are values that are \\(1\/4\\) and \\(3\/4\\) of the way through the ordered data. Q\\(_{1}\\) is the median of the lower half of the data and Q\\(_{3}\\) is the median of the upper half of the data. (Note: there are other ways to find Q\\(_{1}\\) and Q\\(_{3}\\) so check with your teacher.)   Set Y: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{1\\quad\\downarrow\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad2\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad2\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{2}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\) The arrows indicate the location of the quartiles and \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{1+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =1.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{2+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is IQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}\\) = 2 \u2013 1.5 = 0.5. Now consider the other set of data: Set Z: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{18\\quad\\downarrow\\quad23}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad41\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad59\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{63}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad87}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{18+23}{2}\\\\ &amp; =20.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{63+87}{2}\\\\ &amp; =75. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is IQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}=75-20.5=54.5\\) So for the data sets Y and Z the mean together with the IQR are better summaries of the data sets than the range.   Standard Deviation A measure of dispersion or spread in a data set that takes into account all of the data is the standard deviation. It gives an indication of the typical or average distance of each score from the mean for the data. The standard deviation can be calculated using the formula \\[ s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \\] but it is much more convenient to use your calculator or the computer. Some statistical tests make use of the variance which is the square of the standard deviation: \\[ \\text{Variance $=$ }s^{2}=\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}. \\] Set A:\\(\\quad4\\quad4\\quad5\\quad5\\quad5\\quad6\\quad6\\) \\(\\overline{x}=5\\) \\(s=0.82\\) Set B: \\(\\quad1\\quad3\\quad4\\quad5\\quad6\\quad7\\quad9\\) \\(\\overline{x}=5\\) \\(s=2.65\\) We can interpret the standard deviation: the scores in set A are typically \\(0.82\\) away from the mean, but the scores in set B are typically \\(2.65\\) away from the mean. Though set A and B have the same centre, those in set B are clearly more dispersed or have greater spread than set A.    Exercises 1. Given the following scores: \\(12,12,13,14,14,15,15,15,16,\\) find the standard deviation.  2. A class of \\(22\\) students gained the following scores, out of \\(10\\), on a test : \\(5,7,8,7,6,5,6,4,7,4,8,3,7,9,4,9,7,3,6,8,7,5\\). Find the (a) range (b) IQR (c) standard deviation.  3. Pistol Pete is the star full-forward for the local football team. Last season he played \\(20\\) games and kicked the following number of goals in each game: \\(5,6,6,5,7,4,3,1,3,8,7,8,6,0,5,2,7,6,5,6\\).  Find the mean and the standard deviation for the number of goals that Pete kicked per game. Hint: google an online standard deviation calculator or use statistics mode on your calculator.

This module explains the use of this notation.  The Basic Idea We use the Greek symbol sigma \\(\\Sigma\\) to denote summation. \\(\\Sigma\\) is called the summation sign. A typical element of the sequence which is being summed appears to the right of the summation sign as shown in the figure below:  This is written as \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}2i\\). To expand and work out it\u2019s value, we replace \\(i\\) by its starting value (below the sigma symbol) and obtain each successive term by adding \\(1\\) to the previous value until we reach the final value of \\(i\\) (above the sigma symbol) and then we evaluate. For the above sequence: \\[\\begin{align*} {\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}2i &amp; =2\\times1+2\\times2+2\\times3+2\\times4+2\\times5=30\\\\ &amp; =2+4+6+8+10\\\\ &amp; =30. \\end{align*}\\]  Example Expand and evaluate \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=0}^{3}}}}(i^{2}-3)\\) Note that only the \\(i\\) value changes in each term. \\[\\begin{align*} {\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=0}^{3}}}}(i^{2}-3) &amp; =\\underbrace{(0^{2}-3)}_{i=0}+\\underbrace{(1^{2}-3)}_{i=1}+\\underbrace{(2^{2}-3)}_{i=2}+\\underbrace{(3^{2}-3)}_{i=3}\\\\ &amp; =(-3)+(-2)+1+6\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]    Data Sets Subscripted variables are used to indicate values in a data set. \\(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}...\\) refers to first value, second value, third value and so on. Formulae used to calculate summary measures of a data set make use of summation notation.  Example Given the set of data \\(x_{1}=1,x_{2}=2,x_{3}=4,x_{4}=5\\) evaluate  \\(\\overline{x}=\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}}}}{n}\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of items in the data set  This formula calculates the mean or average of a set of data. \\[\\begin{align*} \\overline{x} &amp; =\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{4}x_{i}}}}}{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}}{4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1+2+4+5}{4}\\\\ &amp; =3 \\end{align*}\\]  \\(s^{2}=\\) \\(\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{4}(x_{i}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}}{n-1}\\)  This formula calculates the variance (a measure of spread around the mean) of a sample of data. \\[\\begin{align*} s^{2} &amp; =\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{4}(x_{i}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}}{n-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (x_{1}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (x_{2}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (x_{3}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (x_{4}-}\\overline{x})^{2}}}}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (1-}3)^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (2-}3)^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (4-}3)^{2}}}+{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle (5-}3)^{2}}}}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4+1+1+4}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{3}. \\end{align*}\\]    Exercise 1 Find  \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}3i\\) \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{3}}}}(5i-2)\\) \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{3}}}(}5i)-2\\)       Exercise 2 Given \\(x_{1}=-2,\\,x_{2}=0,\\,x_{3}=1,\\,x_{4}=3,\\,x_{5}=3\\) evaluate  \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}10x_{i}\\) \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle 10\\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}x_{i}\\) \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}(x_{i})^{2}\\) \\(\\left({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}x_{i}\\right)\\) \\(^{2}\\) \\({\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{5}}}}i\\times(x_{i})\\) \\(\\overline{x}=\\frac{{\\textstyle \\mathop{{\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}}}}{n}\\)        Download this page, S1 Summation notation (PDF 139KB)  What's next...

They give us an understanding of how buildings, structures, automobiles and materials react in real life. Moreover they are useful for data scientists. This module does not go into each of these facets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors but describes the method for calculating them.  Definitions Let \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. 1 The order of a matrix \\(A\\) is the number of rows in \\(A\\) times the number of columns in \\(A.\\) If \\(A\\) is a matrix with \\(5\\) rows and \\(6\\) columns, it is said to be a \\(5\\times6\\) (read as five times six) matrix, or has order \\(5\\times6\\). Eigenvector and eigenvalue problems are restricted to square matrices that is, the number of rows and columns of the matrix must be equal. Let \\(X\\) be an \\(n\\times1\\) vector. 2 Note that \\(X\\) is a column matrix (also known as a column vector). If for some constant \\(\\lambda\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\(\\lambda\\) is called an eigenvalue of \\(A\\) and \\(X\\) is called an eigenvector of \\(A.\\) Note that \\(X\\) is a column vector of order \\(\\left(n\\times1\\right)\\). We write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n} \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Usually, if \\(A\\) is a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]   Finding Eigenvalues Remember that the determinant of a matrix \\(A\\) may be written as \\(\\det A\\) or \\(\\left|A\\right|\\).   For a square matrix \\(A\\) the eigenvalues are found by solving the equation \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)=\\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]    Equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is called the CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION of the matrix \\(A.\\) So to find eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation. If \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, there will be at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues of \\(A\\).   Example 1 Find the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The \\(2\\times2\\) identity matrix, \\[\\begin{align*} I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\lambda &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(4\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that in practice we would not bother to include steps \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) above. We would just go directly to \\(\\left(5\\right).\\) To find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\).3 This is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\]  That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(-4-\\lambda\\right)\\left(3-\\lambda\\right)-3\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -12+4\\lambda-3\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}+6 &amp; =0\\\\ \\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6 &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] The equation \\(\\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6=0\\) is the characteristic equation of the matrix \\(A.\\) Factorising the characteristic equation, 4 Sometimes it is not so easy to factorise the equation. In this case you can use the quadratic formula. The solution of the quadratic \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] is given by \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda-6\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\lambda+3\\right)\\left(\\lambda-2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\lambda=-3\\) or \\(\\lambda=2\\). The two eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\).   Example 2 Find the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: We have \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and to find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(2-\\lambda\\right)\\left(2-\\lambda\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=2\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). Note there are two eigenvalues but they have the same value. These are called repeated eigenvalues.    Eigenvectors To each eigenvalue of a matrix \\(A\\) there is a corresponding eigenvector. To find the eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above for each eigenvalue. It is useful to rearrange equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) as follows \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X\\\\ AX-\\lambda X &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we don\u2019t write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda\\right)X=0\\) because this makes no sense. \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix and \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar (a number). You can\u2019t subtract a number from a matrix and so we write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X\\) as in equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)   To obtain eigenvectors, we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] for each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda.\\)   Note that a multiple of any eigenvector is an eigenvector. We do not consider \\(\\vec{X}=\\vec{0}\\) to be an eigenvector.  Example 3 Find the eigenvectors of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] From example 1 above we know the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). We need to solve \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] to get the eigenvectors. Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] where \\(X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right].\\) For \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\left(-3\\right) &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\left(-3\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+6y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] These cannot be solved to give a unique solution as one is a multiple of another.5 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Dividing the second equation by \\(3\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =-2y. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(y=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the solution is \\(x=-2t,\\,y=t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2t\\\\ t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] As \\(t\\) can be any number there are an infinite number of eigenvectors. However, the convention is that we recognise any eigenvector multiplied by a scalar is still an eigenvector and we state the eigenvector in the lowest possible terms. So, the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] For \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-2 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -6 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -6x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Again we see that the one equation is a multiple of another.6 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Let \\(x=t\\) then from the second equation, \\(y=-3t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} t\\\\ -3t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In lowest terms, the eigenvalue corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] See exercise 1 for some practice examples.    Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors for \\(3\\times3\\) Matrices Regardless of the size of the matrix, the method is the same. For eigenvalues we solve equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) and for eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)  Example \\(4\\) Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: First find the eigenvalues by solving: \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\det\\left[B-\\lambda I\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\lambda &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\lambda &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left[-\\lambda\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(1\\right)\\right]-1\\left[-1\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(-2\\right)\\right]-2\\left[1\\left(-1\\right)-\\left(-2\\right)\\left(-\\lambda\\right)\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left(-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1\\right)-\\left(-1+\\lambda+2\\right)-2\\left(-1-2\\lambda\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1+\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda^{3}+\\lambda+1-\\lambda-2+2+4\\lambda\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda. \\end{align*}\\] The characteristic equation is: 7 Note that the characteristic equation is a cubic, that is it is a polynomial of degree \\(3\\). If we had a \\(4\\times4\\) matrix, the characteristic equation would be a polynomial of degree \\(4\\) and so on. \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] To solve this, we factorize to get: \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda^{2}-2\\lambda-3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda-3\\right)\\left(\\lambda+1\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are: \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) In many courses you may solve the characteristic equation using a CAS calculator. Check this with your teacher. We now find the eigenvectors by solving equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) for each eigenvalue. For \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\)we have 8 Note that \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ -x+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Solution of these equations may be done manually or, in some courses, with a CAS calculator. Check with your teacher if you are allowed to solve them with a calculator. We solve them manually below. From equation \\(\\left(9\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =x. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this in \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+y-2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =y. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(x=y=z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=0\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] For \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; -3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ -x-3y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(12\\right)\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(13\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Equations \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(13\\right)\\) are identical and so we have to solve \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right).\\) Let \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right)\\) become \\[\\begin{align*} -2x+y &amp; =2t &amp; \\left(14\\right)\\\\ -x-3y &amp; =-t. &amp; \\left(15\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) by 2 and subtracting from \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y &amp; =4t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{4}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) by 3 and adding to \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -7x &amp; =5t\\\\ x &amp; =-\\frac{5}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\frac{5}{7}\\\\ \\frac{4}{7}\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) is (setting \\(t=7)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -5\\\\ 4\\\\ 7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(16\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we chose \\(t=7\\) to get rid of the fraction in the eigenvector. Note also that the eigenvector \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is also correct as it is just \\(\\left(16\\right)\\) multiplied by \\(-1.\\) For \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ 2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(17\\right)\\\\ -x+y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(18\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(19\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding \\(\\left(17\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(19\\right)\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this into \\(\\left(18\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -x+y+z &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =z. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(z=t,\\) \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector to \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{3} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] To summarise, the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) The corresponding eigenvectors are \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] respectively.   Example 5 Are \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] eigenvectors of \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\)? Solution: One way to solve this problem is to do as in Example 4 above and calculate all the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. However, this is the long way. A shorter and better way is to use the definition of the eigenvector in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above.9 Recall equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X. \\end{align*}\\]  For \\(X_{1}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times1-5\\times2+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times1-2\\times2+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times1-1\\times2-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(20\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{1}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(20\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(21\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The first two rows of \\(\\left(21\\right)\\) imply that \\(\\lambda=-1.\\) But then the third row implies that \\(-5=-1\\) which is a contradiction. We conclude that \\(X_{1}\\)is not an eigenvector of \\(A.\\) For \\(X_{2}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-5\\times0+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)-1\\times0-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(22\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{2}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(22\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\lambda\\\\ 0\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] It is clear that \\(\\lambda=-7\\) and so \\(X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) is an eigenvector of the matrix \\(A\\).    Important Points to Remember  An \\(n\\times n\\) matrix will have at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues. An eigenvalue may be zero. An eigenvector multiplied by any number other than 0 is also an eigenvector. In particular, if \\(X\\) is an eigenvector then so is \\(-X.\\) An eigenvector cannot be the zero vector, \\(\\vec{0.}\\) See exercises 2 and 3 for some practice problems.

Maths resources uplift The ongoing improvement of the maths pages in the Learning Lab continues with learning modules being converted from PDF to accessible HTML. Formatting and styles on these pages have been updated to provide a more consistent and accessible experience. These changes have extended across the Learning Lab and are a welcome improvement throughout the site. The menu pages have all been updated to a more user-friendly list format, moving away from obscuring this content within accordions. We have begun adding short descriptions of each page to these menus to make it easier for users to identify the content that they need. Don't worry about those poor, lost accordions though. They have found a more useful purpose, logically 'hiding' the answers to quizzes in the maths pages until the user chooses to reveal them. Behind the scenes Customer Experience (CX) workshops The RMIT University Library Digital Learning Team have run 4 workshops with over 30 members of the RMIT Library Learning teams. The workshops have two formats, one for small groups and one for larger groups. Regardless of the group size, the workshops ask participants to think about how the 7 library user types, identified in the Library's Digital Experience Plan, and how these users find and interact with the Learning Lab. Using Teams breakout groups and Miro boards, we have structured an interactive and informative way for participants to think of existing and novel ways to engage users in the Learning Lab and to improve their experience of learning objects when they are there. These workshops have been critical insights as the Learning Team provide front-line support and resources to students and have unique insights on the RMIT student need.  The Digital Learning Team have received some invaluable feedback and direction on:  Reaching user types to make them aware of the Learning Lab Improving the experience of users once they are on the Learning Lab Ideas about how we can best structure the resources Insight into taxonomy and how we can best use tags to improve the user experience Missing resources &ndash; sought after information that would benefit the student cohort.  Art and Design Work has commenced on developing materials for foundation skills in Art and Design, including uplift of the 'Artist statement' materials and colour theory - watch this space. What's coming  Pedagogical templates to provide better User Interface (UI) waypoints for students undertaking learning activites Contributors style and writing guide to facilitate the development of new resources Export and distribution of materials in the Learning Lab to Canvas Commons A new home page and navigation stucture to better support current user flows&nbsp;(finally).

Some integrals cannot be evaluated in terms of the rules of integration or elementary functions.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Methodology\n\n\n\n  You will have evaluated definite integrals such as \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3} &amp; \\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] before. In doing this, you are evaluating the area under the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3.\\) This is only possible if you can find an antiderivative for \\(x^{2}\\). In this example it is easy, the antiderivative is \\[\\begin{align*} F\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\text{ where $c$ is a constant.} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3}\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =F\\left(3\\right)-F\\left(1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}3^{3}+c-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}1^{3}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{26}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Sometimes it is not possible to find the antiderivative. In such cases you need to use a numerical method. Two common methods for calculating definite integrals are:  Simpson\u2019s rule, and The trapezoidal rule.  This module considers the trapezoidal rule.  The Trapezoidal Rule The trapezoidal rule works by estimating the area under a graph by a series of trapezoidal strips. In the figure below, we see an approximation to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{6} &amp; xe^{-0.5x}dx \\end{align*}\\] using three strips. The approximated area is shown in red.  In this case, we see the trapezoidal rule will underestimate the first strip, is close in the second strip and will overestimate in the third strip. The trapezoidal rule approximates the area under the curve by adding the areas of the trapezoids. Any number of strips may be used. The accuracy increases as the number of strips increases. For the definite integral \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] the trapezoidal rule has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; \\approx\\frac{h}{2}\\left[y_{0}+2y_{1}+2y_{2}+\\ldots+2y_{n-1}+y_{n}\\right] &amp; (1) \\end{align*}\\] where  \\(n\\) is the number of strips and can be any number. \\(y_{n}=f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) are the values of \\(f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) at the points \\(x_{i}\\) where \\(i=0,1,2,\\ldots,n\\). Note that \\(x_{0}=a,\\) \\(x_{n}=b.\\) \\(h\\) is the width of each strip and \\[\\begin{align*} h &amp; =\\frac{b-a}{n}. \\end{align*}\\] \\(x_{1}=a+h,\\) \\(x_{2}=a+2h,\\) \\(x_{3}=a+3h,\\) \\(\\ldots\\) and so on.

Newton\u2019s method is one such method and allows us to calculate the solution of f(x)=0.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Methodology\n\n\n\n  You are used to solving equations using basic algebraic operations and perhaps the quadratic formula. However, some equations cannot be solved using these methods. For example the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} e^{-x} &amp; =x &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} -\\ln\\left(x\\right) &amp; =x^{3} &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] cannot be solved using conventional methods. However they can be solved using numerical methods. The important aspect of equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is that they can be re-arranged to \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) That is, the problem can be transformed to finding the root of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\).1 A root of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is the value of \\(x\\) for which \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) Common numerical methods for root finding are:  Newton\u2019s method (also called the Newton-Raphson method) the Bisection method.  In this module we consider Newton\u2019s method.  The Newton-Raphson Method Newton\u2019s method (Newton-Raphson) can provide the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\). It has the form: \\[\\begin{align*} x_{n+1} &amp; =x_{n}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{n}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{n}\\right)} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(n\\) starts at \\(0.\\) The method is iterative, you start at \\(n=0\\) and continue by incrementing \\(n\\) by one until you achieve the desired accuracy. Note that:  \\(x_{0}\\) is called the first estimate of the root, or the initial guess, \\(x_{n+1}\\) is the new estimate of the root, and \\(x_{n}\\) is the old estimate of the root, \\(f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) is the value of the function at \\(x_{n}\\) and, \\(f'\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) is the value of the derivative of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) at \\(x_{n}.\\)   Example 1 Find the solution of \\(e^{-x}=x\\) for \\(0&lt;x&lt;1\\) to three decimal places. Solution: First define the function:2 Note that you can also use \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x-e^{-x}\\) as it is equal to zero at the same value of \\(x\\) as \\(f\\left(x\\right)=e^{-x}-x.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =e^{-x}-x. \\end{align*}\\] We want to find \\(x\\) where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\). To do this we need an initial guess \\(x_{0}\\) of the root. This is easily done by graphing both \\(y=x\\) and \\(y=e^{-x}.\\) The point where the graphs intersect is the point where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) The graphs are shown below.  A suitable value for \\(x_{0}\\) would be \\(0.5\\) and \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =-e^{-x}-1 \\end{align*}\\] Using eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), we can start the method \\[\\begin{align*} x_{1} &amp; =x_{0}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{0}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5-\\frac{f\\left(0.5\\right)}{f'\\left(0.5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5-\\frac{e^{-0.5}-0.5}{-e^{-0.5}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5663\\\\ x_{2} &amp; =0.5663-\\frac{f\\left(0.5663\\right)}{f'\\left(0.5663\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5663-\\frac{e^{-0.5663}-0.5663}{-e^{-0.5663}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671\\\\ x_{3} &amp; =x_{2}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{2}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{2}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671-\\frac{e^{-0.5671}-0.5671}{-e^{-0.5671}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671. \\end{align*}\\] There has been no change to the first four places so we stop and the answer is \\(x=0.567\\,.\\)   Example 2 Find the solution of \\(-\\ln\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}\\) correct to five decimal places with an initial guess of \\(x_{0}=1.\\) Solution: Define the function \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =x^{3}+\\ln\\left(x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =3x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x}. \\end{align*}\\] In this case we have a value for \\(x_{0}\\) so there is no need to graph the functions. But we do it anyway.3 It is a good idea to graph the functions because it allows us to get an idea of the answer. If Newton\u2019s method gives a result that is different to what we see in the graph, we have to consider that a mistake has been made or Newton\u2019s method has found another root that we did not see on our graph.  From the graph we see the answer should be about \\(0.7\\). Using Newton\u2019s method: \\[\\begin{align*} x_{1} &amp; =x_{0}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{0}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =1-\\frac{1^{3}+\\ln\\left(1\\right)}{3\\cdot1^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{1}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =1-\\frac{1+0}{3+1}\\\\ &amp; =0.75\\\\ x_{2} &amp; =0.75-\\frac{\\left(0.75\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.75\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.75\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.75}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7055775\\\\ x_{3} &amp; =0.7055775-\\frac{\\left(0.7055775\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.7055775\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.7055775\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.7055775}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7047098\\\\ x_{4} &amp; =0.7047098-\\frac{\\left(0.7047098\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.7047098\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.7047098\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.7047098}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7047095. \\end{align*}\\] As we have no change in the first five places after the decimal point we stop and take the answer as \\(x=0.70471\\,.\\) Note that we round up the fifth digit.    Convergence of the Newton-Raphson Method Convergence indicates how quickly you will get an acceptable value of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\). Slow convergence implies many iterations, while fast convergence means few iterations. Convergence of the method depends on the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and the initial guess. If the initial guess is in an area where the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is nearly zero, convergence can be slow. Consider the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{4}-1.\\) It is graphed below.  Obviously the solutions of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\). These can be obtained by basic algebra and there is no need to use Newton\u2019s method. However we will use this function to see what happens with different guesses for \\(x_{0}\\). We assume an accuracy to two decimal places and a calculation tolerance of \\(0.0000001\\). Let \\(x_{0}=0.1\\). In this region the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is close to zero. Newton\u2019s method takes 25 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\) Let \\(x_{0}=0.25\\) then it takes 15 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\) Let \\(x_{0}=0.5\\) then it takes 9 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\) Let \\(x_{0}=0.75\\) then it takes 6 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\) So we see the number of iterations decrease (higher convergence) when the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) increases.   Convergence to Another Root. If the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) has several roots, Newton\u2019s method may converge to any of these. For example the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}+2x^{2}-5x-6\\) has three roots at \\(x=-3,-1\\) and \\(2\\) as shown below.  If we set \\(x_{0}=-2\\) we, perhaps, would think the method should find the root \\(x=-3\\text{ or $-1$ }.\\) But Newton\u2019s method finds the root at \\(x=2.\\) This is why it is important to graph the function if possible.

Simpson\u2019s rule is a numerical method that calculates a numerical value for a definite integral.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Methodology\n\n\n\n  The figure above shows how Simpson\u2019s rule approximates the area under the graph of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) by the area under a parabola using two strips. You will have evaluated definite integrals such as \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3} &amp; \\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] before. In doing this, you are evaluating the area under the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3.\\) This is only possible if you can find an antiderivative for \\(x^{2}\\).

In such cases you need to use a numerical method. Two common methods for calculating definite integrals are:  Simpson\u2019s rule, and The trapezoidal rule.  This module considers Simpson\u2019s rule.  Simpson\u2019s Rule Simpson\u2019s rule estimates the value of the definite integral \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx. \\end{align*}\\] Simpson\u2019s rule estimates the area under the graph of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) by approximating the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a parabola and calculating the area under the parabola. Each parabolic approximation is done over two strips. The accuracy of the Simpson\u2019s Rule approximation increases as you use more strips. There must be an even number of strips. Simpson\u2019s rule has the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; \\approx\\frac{1}{3}h\\left[y_{0}+4\\sum_{i=1,3,5,\\ldots}^{n-1}y_{i}+2\\sum_{i=2,4,6,\\ldots}^{n-2}y_{i}+y_{n}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}h\\left[y_{0}+4y_{1}+2y_{2}+4y_{3}+2y_{4}+\\ldots+4y_{n-1}+y_{n}\\right] &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where  \\(n\\) is the number of strips. Note that \\(n\\) must be even. \\(y_{i}=f\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\) are the values of \\(f\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\) at the points \\(x_{i}\\) where \\(i=0,1,2,3\\ldots,n\\). Note that \\(x_{0}=a,\\) \\(x_{n}=b.\\) \\(h\\) is the width of each strip and \\[\\begin{align*} h &amp; =\\frac{b-a}{n}. \\end{align*}\\] \\(x_{1}=a+h,\\) \\(x_{2}=a+2h,\\) \\(x_{3}=a+3h,\\) \\(\\ldots\\) and so on.  Note that the value of the function at the odd numbered points are multiplied by four whereas the even numbered points are multiplied by two in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above. The accuracy of the Simpson\u2019s Rule approximation of an integral increases as you use more strips.  Example 1 Using Simpson\u2019s rule, find the value of \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3} &amp; \\left(e^{2x}\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] using \\(2\\) strips to an accuracy of \\(3\\) decimal places. This integral may be evaluated and is approximately equal to \\(100.96243981\\). Solution: Consider the figure below.  Simpson\u2019s rule approximates the real function by a parabola (shown in green\/black dotted lines).1 Note that three points are needed to fit a parabola. The area given by Simpson\u2019s rule is the shaded area under the parabola. From the graph we can see that Simpson\u2019s rule will overestimate the area under the real graph from \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=2\\) and underestimate the area from \\(x=2\\) to \\(x=3.\\) We have \\(n=2,\\) \\(a=1,\\) \\(b=3\\) and2 The first strip is from \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=2.\\) The second is from \\(x=2\\) to \\(x=3.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} h &amp; =\\frac{b-a}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3-1}{2}\\\\ &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Calculating the three points and the value of the function at those points we have:3 Note that the number of points \\(p\\) and the number of strips \\(n\\) are related by \\[\\begin{align*} p &amp; =n+1. \\end{align*}\\] We stop calculating points when \\(x_{n}=b.\\) In this example \\(n=2\\) and there are \\(3=2+1\\) points at which the function must be evaluated. They are \\(x_{0},x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}.\\) \\(x_{0}=a=1\\) and \\(y_{0}=e^{2\\left(1\\right)}\\sin\\left(1\\right)=6.2176763.\\) \\(x_{1}=a+h=1+1=2\\) and \\(y_{1}=e^{2\\left(2\\right)}\\sin\\left(2\\right)=49.6459573.\\) \\(x_{2}=a+2h=1+2=3\\) and \\(y_{3}=e^{2\\left(3\\right)}\\sin\\left(3\\right)=56.9318746.\\) Now we substitute this in the Simpson\u2019s rule formula \\(\\left(1\\right).\\) We get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3}\\left(e^{2x}\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}h\\left[y_{0}+4y_{1}+y_{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1\\right)\\left[6.2176763+4\\left(49.6459573\\right)+56.9318746\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}\\left[6.2176763+4\\left(49.6459573\\right)+56.9318746\\right]\\\\ &amp; =87.2444601. \\end{align*}\\] The answer, to three decimal places, is \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3}\\left(e^{2x}\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =87.244. \\end{align*}\\] This is well under the value of \\(100.96243981\\).

Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It includes things that can be seen (all living and non-living, natural and synthetic things) and cannot be seen to the naked eye (e.g.&nbsp;air and microorganisms). Physical states of matter Matter exists in three physical states: solid, liquid and gas. Solid The particles in a solid are packed tightly with a regular pattern. Hence, they do not pass each other. Solids have a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Liquid The particles in a liquid are situated close together without a regular pattern. The distance between two particles is large enough for one particle to pass the other. Liquid takes the shape of the container - it has an indefinite shape. Liquid has a fixed volume. Gas The particles in a gas are separated without a regular pattern. Gas takes the shape of the container - it has an indefinite shape. Gas fills the space of the container - it has an indefinite volume.  Start animation Stop animation       Change of state The conversion of a substance from one state to another is known as the change of state. Examples:  Melting of ice (solid to liquid). Boiling of water (liquid to gas). Freezing of water (liquid to solid).  Water is one of the few substances which can exist in all three states: solid ice, liquid water, gaseous steam. State changes have different names depending on which states are involved:  The change of solid to liquid is known as melting. The change of liquid to gas is known as vaporization. The change of gas to solid is known as deposition. The change of solid to gas is known as sublimation. The change of liquid to solid is known as freezing. The change of gas to liquid is known as condensation.   Properties of matter Properties of matter can be classified into two types depending on whether the particular property is determined by changing the chemical identity or composition of the substance.  Properties of matter   Are the properties observed\/measured without changing the chemical identity of the substance?    NO = chemical property   YES = physical property    Flammability - when wood burns it changes to ashes Shape    Corrosion - rusting of iron objects after exposure to moist air for a long time  Colour   Decomposition - hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of heat or light Odour   Reactivity - potassium reacts with water Hardness     Melting point      Boiling point      Physical state (liquid, solid, gas)    Changes in the matter Changes in the matter are classified into two categories: physical change and chemical change. Physical change A physical change is when the substance changes its physical appearance or state without affecting the chemical identity. For example, the melting of ice to give water is a physical change because water only changes its physical state from solid to liquid without affecting its chemical identity.  Examples:  the grating of a piece of cheese boiling of water sugar dissolving in water  Chemical change A chemical change is a process in which the substance changes its chemical identity or composition. It involves the formation of new substances that have different properties compared to the original substance. For example, iron objects turn reddish-brown (known as rusting) when exposed to moist air for a long period is a chemical change because iron combines with oxygen and moisture from the air to form a new substance, rust. Examples:  sugar heated in a saucepan to make caramel burning of potassium in water milk turning sour  Classification of matter The flowchart below shows how you can determine the classification of matter through a series of simple yes\/no questions.  Classification of matter     Matter  Anything that has mass and occupies space   Are properties and composition constant?              Yes    Pure substance  A substance that has a uniform chemical composition throughout e.g. Water, sugar, table salt    Can the pure substance be broken into simpler substances?             Yes    Chemical compound  Can be chemically broken down into constituent elements e.g. Water, sugar, table salt    No    Element  Cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical or physical means e.g. Hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur      No    Mixture  Physical combination of two or more pure substances e.g. Salt-sand mixture, sea water, concrete    Does the mixture have a uniform composition throughout?             Yes    Homogenous Mixture  One visible phase which has uniform composition throughout e.g. Sea water, coffee, air    No    Hetereogeneous mixture  Two or more visible phases which have non-uniform composition throughout e.g. Vegetable stew, meat pie       Test your knowledge Take the States of matter: Quiz Use the States of Matter: Interactive   const manual = new Freezeframe('.freezeme', { trigger: false }); document .querySelector('.start') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.start(); }); document .querySelector('.stop') .addEventListener('click', () => { manual.stop(); }); ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1355 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.

These side lengths are identified as either the hypotenuse or the opposite or adjacent sides to the angle. This module shows how to apply trigonometric ratios to find a missing side length, or angle, in a right-angled triangle. Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics involving the study of triangles, and has applications in fields such as engineering, surveying, navigation, optics, and electronics. The ability to use and manipulate trigonometric functions is necessary in other branches of mathematics, including calculus, vectors and complex numbers.  Right-angled Triangles A right angle is formed when two lines meet at an angle of \\(90^{\\circ}.\\) Usually a right angle is shown by the symbol shown below.  A right-angled triangle is any triangle that contains a right angle. In a right-angled triangle the three sides are given special names. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse (h) \u2013 this is always the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are named in relation to another known angle (or an unknown angle under consideration).    Trigonometric Ratios In a right-angled triangle the following ratios are defined for a given angle \\(\\theta\\) \\[\\begin{align*} sine\\,\\theta &amp; =\\frac{(opposite\\;side\\;length)}{(hypotenuse\\;length)}\\\\ cosine\\,\\theta &amp; =\\frac{(adjacent\\;side\\;length)}{(hypotenuse\\;length)}\\\\ tangent\\,\\theta &amp; =\\frac{(opposite\\;side\\;length)}{(adjacent\\;side\\;length)} \\end{align*}\\] These ratios are abbreviated to \\(\\sin\\theta\\), \\(\\cos\\theta\\), and \\(\\tan\\theta\\) respectively. A useful memory aid is SOH CAH TOA: \\(\\boldsymbol{S}in\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{O}pp}{\\boldsymbol{H}yp}\\) \\(Cos\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{A}dj}{\\boldsymbol{H}yp}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{T}an\\,\\theta=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{O}pp}{\\boldsymbol{A}dj}\\) These ratios can be used to find unknown sides and angles in right-angled triangles.   Examples  Evaluating Ratios In the right-angled triangle below evaluate \\(sin\\,\\theta\\), \\(cos\\,\\theta\\), and \\(tan\\,\\theta\\).    Finding Angles Find the value of the angle in the triangle below1 Step 1: Determine which ratio to use Step 2: Write the relevant equation Step 3: Substitute the values Step 4: Solve the equation  In this triangle we know two sides and need to find the angle . The known sides are the opposite side and the hypotenuse. The ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine ratio. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{Opp}{Hyp}\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{13.4}{19.7}\\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; =0.6802\\\\ \\theta &amp; =\\sin^{-1\\ }(0.6802)\\\\ \\theta &amp; =42.9^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\]   Finding Side Lengths Find the value of the indicated unknown side length in each of the following right-angled triangles.     In this problem we know an angle and the adjacent side. The side to be determined is the opposite side. The ratio that relates these two sides is the tangent ratio. \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\theta &amp; =\\frac{Opp}{Adj}\\\\ \\tan27^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{b}{42}\\\\ (\\tan27^{\\circ})\\times42 &amp; =b\\\\ b &amp; =21.4cm \\end{align*}\\]     In this problem we know an angle and the adjacent side. The side to be determined is the hypotenuse. The ratio that relates these two sides is the cosine ratio. \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{Adj}{Hyp}\\\\ \\cos35^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{7}{x}\\\\ (\\cos35^{\\circ})\\times x &amp; =7\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{7}{\\cos35^{\\circ}}\\\\ x &amp; =8.55 \\end{align*}\\]    Special Angles and Exact Values There are some special angles for which the trigonometric functions have exact values rather than decimal approximations.2 It is a good idea to remember these values. They occur often in maths courses. Applying the rules for sine, cosine and tangent to the triangles below, exact values for the sine, cosine and tangent of the angles \\(30^{\\circ}\\), \\(45^{\\circ}\\) and \\(60^{\\circ}\\) can be found.   \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin45^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\qquad\\cos45^{\\circ}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\qquad\\tan45^{\\circ}=1\\\\ \\sin60{}^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\qquad\\cos60^{\\circ}=\\frac{1}{2}\\qquad\\tan60^{\\circ}=\\sqrt{3}\\\\ \\sin30^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\qquad\\cos30^{\\circ}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\qquad\\tan30^{\\circ}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises  Exercise 1 Using the right-angled triangle below find: (a) \\(\\sin\\theta\\), (b) \\(\\tan\\theta\\), (c) \\(\\cos\\alpha\\), (d) \\(\\tan\\alpha\\) (Hint: Use Pythagoras theorem to find the hypotenuse)     Exercise 2 Find the value of the indicated unknown (side length or angle) in each of the following diagrams.

Two new sections have been created to house introduction to law materials and assessment help specific to law assignments. Materials in these sections will help students studying law subjects and those who have legal issues as part of the subject matter of their courses. We have launched two new interactive videos that step students through finding Australian state and federal case law and legislation. New guides to writing case notes and legal memos complement the existing materials on writing law essays.      The finishing touches are changing the referencing to AGLC4 throughout the text, checking case citations for currency and relevancy and auditing the other materials in the Law section.

Atomic number An atomic number (Z) is the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. Since an atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons present in an atom.  Atomic number (Z) = Number of protons = Number of electrons    Mass number A mass number (A) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom.  Mass number (A) = Number of protons + Number of neutrons  The number of subatomic particles present in an atom can be determined using its atomic number and mass number, as shown below.  Number of protons = Atomic number (Z) Number of electrons = Atomic number (Z) Number of neutrons = Massnumber (A) - Atomic number (Z) Total number of subatomic particles present in an atom = Mass number (A) + Atomic number (Z)  Isotopes and atomic masses Isotopes are atoms of an element with the same number of protons and electrons but different numbers of neutrons. Examples: Carbon has three isotopes: \\(\\ce{_{6}^{12}C}\\), \\(\\ce{_{6}^{13}C}\\), \\(\\ce{_{6}^{14}C}\\) Chlorine has two isotopes: \\(\\ce{_{17}^{35}Cl}\\), \\(\\ce{_{17}^{37}Cl}\\) Hydrogen has three isotopes: \\(\\ce{_{1}^{1}H}\\), \\(\\ce{_{1}^{2}H}\\), \\(\\ce{_{1}^{3}H}\\)  Atomic mass is the weighted average mass of an atom of an element.

There are rules for adding and subtracting matrices and these are reviewed in this module. Matrices of the same shape (same number of rows and columns) may be added and subtracted.  Addition Matrices of the same shape (same number of rows and columns) may be added by adding the corresponding elements. For example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right],\\,B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\;\\textrm{and $C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]$ }. \\end{align*}\\] Notice that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same shape \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\). Then \\(A+B\\) makes sense because they are both \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and we have \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3+1 &amp; 2+0 &amp; -1+2\\\\ 1+3 &amp; 5+1 &amp; -4+(-2) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 6 &amp; -6 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] However \\(A+C\\) is not defined as \\(A\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\). You cannot add matrices that have different shape. Note that the order of addition is the same as for real numbers. That is: \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =B+A \\end{align*}\\]   Subtraction Matrices of the same the shape may be subtracted by subtracting corresponding elements. For example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right],\\,B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\;\\textrm{and $C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]$ }. \\end{align*}\\] Then \\(A-B\\) makes sense because they are both \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and we have \\[\\begin{align*} A-B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3-1 &amp; 2-0 &amp; -1-2\\\\ 1-3 &amp; 5-1 &amp; -4-(-2) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 2 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 4 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] However \\(A-C\\) is not defined as \\(A\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\). You cannot subtract matrices that have different shape. As another example consider \\(B-A\\) we have \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} B-A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 0-2 &amp; 2-(-1)\\\\ 3-1 &amp; 1-5 &amp; -2-(-4) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{alignat*}\\] Note that \\(A-B\\neq B-A\\). The order in which matrices are subtracted is important just as it is when subtracting real numbers. In fact, \\(B-A=-\\left(A-B\\right)\\).   Scalar Multiplication Matrices may be multiplied by a number. To do this each element in the matrix is multiplied by the number. For example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\textrm{ and $B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} 5A &amp; =5\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5\\times1 &amp; 5\\times2\\\\ 5\\times5 &amp; 5\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 10\\\\ 25 &amp; 20 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Another example is \\[\\begin{align*} -2A &amp; =-2\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2\\times1 &amp; -2\\times2\\\\ -2\\times5 &amp; -2\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2 &amp; -4\\\\ -10 &amp; -8 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] You can also use scalar multiplication with addition or subtraction. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 5A-2B &amp; =5\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]-2\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5\\times1 &amp; 5\\times2\\\\ 5\\times5 &amp; 5\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ 2\\times0 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 10\\\\ 25 &amp; 20 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -6\\\\ 0 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5-4 &amp; 10-\\left(-6\\right)\\\\ 25-0 &amp; 20-\\left(-2\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 16\\\\ 25 &amp; 22 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]   Exercises  Given \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 2\\\\ 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 3\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right], \\end{align*}\\] find if possible: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,A+B &amp; b)\\,B-C &amp; c)\\,A-D &amp; d)\\,B+E &amp; e)\\,E-D.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\] Given \\[\\begin{align*} A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right], \\end{align*}\\] find if possible: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,2A+B &amp; b)\\,4D-B &amp; c)\\,3C-A &amp; d)\\,B+2D+E &amp; e)\\,3C-A+2E\\end{array}. \\end{align*}\\]        Download this page, M2 Addition and subtraction of matrices (PDF 110KB)  What's next...

That is, the number of rows and columns is the same. Matrices may also be multiplied. However the requirements for multiplication are very different to that for addition\/subtraction. This module looks at matrix multiplication.  Matrix Shape or Order of a Matrix The shape of a matrix is the number of rows and columns. When describing a matrix you give the number of rows by the number of columns. This is sometimes called the order of the matrix. For example, the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 0\\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is a said to be a one by four matrix as it has \\(1\\) row and \\(4\\) columns. We could also say the order of \\(A\\) is \\(1\\times4\\). The matrix \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 5\\\\ 2 &amp; 6\\\\ 4 &amp; 7\\\\ 5 &amp; 89 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is a \\(5\\times2\\) matrix because it has \\(5\\) rows and \\(2\\) columns. It has order \\(5\\times2\\).   Conditions for Matrix Multiplication Two matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns of the first matrix is the same as the number of rows of the second matrix. The result of the multiplication is another matrix with the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. If this is not the case, the multiplication is undefined. Symbolically let \\(A\\) be an \\(m\\times p\\) matrix and let \\(B\\) be an \\(q\\times n\\) matrix. Then the product \\(A\\times B=AB\\) will be an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix provided that \\(p=q\\). If \\(p\\neq q\\) the matrix multiplication is not defined. For example, a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix cannot be multiplied by a \\(1\\times4\\) matrix because \\(3\\neq1\\) whereas it is possible to multiply a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix.   Matrix Multiplication Let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] we want to find, if it exists, the product \\(AB\\). First note that we are multiplying a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and so matrix multiplication is possible and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix. You should always check that the multiplication is possible. Now the multiplication procedure is a bit strange at first. The first element of row \\(1\\) of the resulting matrix \\(AB\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+4\\times3+5\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2+12+20 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 2nd element of row \\(1\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2\\times6+4\\times1+5\\times2\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 12+4+10\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 1st element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7\\times1+8\\times3+9\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Finally the the 2nd element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 7\\times6+8\\times1+9\\times2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 42+8+18 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 68 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]  Example \\(1\\): Let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Find a) \\(AB\\;\\) b) \\(BA\\;\\) c) \\(AA\\;\\) d) \\(BB\\) if they exist. Solution:  Since \\(A\\) is \\(2\\times2\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(2\\times3\\), the number of columns in \\(A\\) is equal to the number of rows in \\(B\\) and so \\(AB\\) exists and will be a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2\\times2+1\\times0 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times0 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times2 &amp; 3\\times0+0\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] The number of columns of \\(B\\) is \\(3\\) and the number of rows of \\(A\\) is \\(2\\). Since they are unequal, \\(BA\\) is not defined and \\(BA\\) does not exist. Since \\(A\\) has the same number of rows and columns1 \\(A\\) is called a square matrix.  and so \\(AA\\) exists.2 We sometimes write \\(AA=A^{2.}.\\) We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2+1\\times3 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times0\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times3 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 7 &amp; 2\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] The number of columns and rows in \\(B\\) are unequal and so \\(BB\\) does not exist.3 Only square matrices can be squared.    Example 2: Let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] find if they exist, a) \\(AB\\) and b) \\(BA\\). Solution:  Since the number of columns and rows is the same for matrices \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), both \\(BC\\) and \\(CB\\) exist and will be \\(2\\times2\\) matrices. We have \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+\\left(-1\\right)\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\\\ 1\\times1+3\\times2 &amp; 1\\times0+3\\times\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 7 &amp; -3 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} BA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times2+0\\times1 &amp; 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)+0\\times3\\\\ 2\\times2+\\left(-1\\right)\\times1 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)+\\left(-1\\right)\\times3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\]  From this example we can see that, in general, \\(AB\\neq BA\\). We say that matrix multiplication is not commutative and the order of multiplication matters. There is an exception to this as explained in the next section.    Multiplication by the Unit Matrix A square matrix with ones along its leading diagonal and zeros elsewhere is called a unit matrix (also called an identity matrix). The order of the unit matrix is sometimes noted with a subscript. For example, \\[\\begin{align*} I_{1}=\\left[1\\right],\\;I_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] The unit matrix acts like the number one in the real number system. When matrix multiplication is defined, multiplication by the unit matrix leaves the original matrix unchanged. Multiplying a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by the unit matrix \\(I_{n}\\) shows that the order of multiplication does not matter.4 This is only true for square matrices That is \\[\\begin{align*} AI_{n} &amp; =I_{n}A. \\end{align*}\\] For example, let \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Since \\(A\\) has two columns we need the unit matrix to have two rows and two columns. That is \\(I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} AI &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+2\\times0 &amp; 1\\times0+2\\times1\\\\ 3\\times1+3\\times0 &amp; 3\\times0+4\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} IA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+0\\times3 &amp; 1\\times2+0\\times4\\\\ 0\\times1+1\\times3 &amp; 0\\times2+1\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A. \\end{align*}\\] So, in this case, \\(AI=IA=A\\).   Exercises Let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 3\\\\ -2 &amp; -4\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -5\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 4\\\\ 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 2\\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -3 &amp; 2 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Find (if they exist) \\[\\begin{array}{lllllllcc} a)\\,BA &amp; b)\\,DB &amp; c)\\,CD &amp; d)\\,AA=A^{2} &amp; e)\\,BB=B^{2} &amp; f)\\,AD &amp; g)\\,BE &amp; h)\\,EA &amp; i)\\,CB\\end{array}\\]        Download this page, M3 Matrix multiplication (PDF 128KB)  What's next...

Expanding along row one. Multiply \\(a_{1}\\) by the second order determinant obtained by ignoring the row and column occupied by \\(a_{1}.\\) We get \\[ a_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} b_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ b_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|. \\] Now multiply \\(b_{1}\\) by the second order determinant obtained by ignoring the row and column occupied by \\(b_{1}.\\) We get \\[ b_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|. \\] Now multiply \\(c_{1}\\) by the second order determinant obtained by ignoring the row and column occupied by \\(c_{1}.\\) We get \\[ c_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; b_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; b_{3} \\end{array}\\right|. \\] The determinant of \\(B\\) is then \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|B\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1} &amp; b_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{2} &amp; b_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; b_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =a_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} b_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ b_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|-b_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|+c_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; b_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; b_{3} \\end{array}\\right|. \\end{align*}\\] Note the change in sign on the second term.

In the case above we expanded along row one. We get the same value of determinant regardless of which row or column we expand about. Now we expand along column \\(2\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|B\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1} &amp; b_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{2} &amp; b_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; b_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-b_{1}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{2} &amp; c_{2}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|+b_{2}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{3} &amp; c_{3} \\end{array}\\right|-b_{3}\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} a_{1} &amp; c_{1}\\\\ a_{2} &amp; c_{2} \\end{array}\\right|. \\end{align*}\\] Again, note the sign changes.  Example 1 Calculate the determinant of \\[ A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]. \\] Solution 1: Expanding along row one we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =2\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|+3\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(\\left(-1\\right)\\times4-1\\times2\\right)-\\left(1\\times4-2\\times2\\right)+3\\left(1\\times1-2\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(-4-2\\right)-\\left(4-4\\right)+3\\left(1+2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-12+9\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] Solution 2: This time we will expand about column 2 to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left(1\\times4-2\\times2\\right)-\\left(2\\times4-2\\times3\\right)-1\\left(2\\times2-1\\times3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-1\\left(4-4\\right)-\\left(8-6\\right)-1\\left(4-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-2-1\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] as before.   Example 2 Calculate the determinant of \\[ B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]. \\] Solution: Expanding along column 1 we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|B\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|-1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; -2\\\\ 6 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right|+2\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =1\\left(\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-4\\right)-6\\times3\\right)-1\\left(3\\times\\left(-4\\right)-6\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)+2\\left(3\\times3-\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-2\\right)\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(4-18\\right)-\\left(-12-\\left(-12\\right)\\right)+2\\left(9-2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-14+14\\\\ &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Note that row \\(3\\) of \\(B\\) is a multiple of row \\(1.\\) In general, when a row is a multiple of another row, the determinant is zero. Also if a column is a multiple of another column, the determinant is zero.   Example 3 Calculate the determinant of \\[ C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\] Solution: This time it is best to expand about column \\(2\\) or row \\(3.\\) This is because column \\(2\\) or row \\(3\\) contains a zero which makes the calculation easier. Expanding along row \\(3\\) we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|C\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =4\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 6\\\\ -2 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|-0\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right|+1\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 5\\\\ 3 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right|\\\\ &amp; =4\\left(5\\times2-\\left(-2\\right)\\times6\\right)+1\\left(1\\times\\left(-2\\right)-3\\times5\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4\\left(10+12\\right)+1\\left(-2-15\\right)\\\\ &amp; =88-17\\\\ &amp; =71. \\end{align*}\\] See Exercise 2 for some practice.    Evaluating Higher Order Determinants Fourth order determinants can be evaluated using third order determinants and fifth order by using fourth order and so forth. When doing this, you need to apply the following signs \\[ \\left|\\begin{array}{ccccc} + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; \\cdots\\\\ - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; \\cdots\\\\ + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; \\cdots\\\\ - &amp; + &amp; - &amp; + &amp; \\cdots\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots \\end{array}\\right| \\] Calculators capable of doing matrix algebra can also be used to evaluate determinants.   Exercise 1 Evaluate the following determinants: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; b)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; c)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; d)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; -3\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; e)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; -3\\\\ -3 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right|.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]    Exercise 2 Evaluate the following determinants: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; b)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -3\\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; c)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -1 &amp; 5 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; -5 &amp; -6\\\\ -2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; d)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; 3 &amp; -3\\\\ 6 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right| &amp; e)\\,\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; b &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c \\end{array}\\right|.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]       Download this page, M4 Determinant of a matrix (PDF 142KB)  What's next...

This is sometimes called Gaussian elimination.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Matrices\n\n\n\n   Matrices can be used to solve systems of equations by using elementary row operations and the augmented matrix. This module discusses these topics.  The Augmented Matrix Consider the following system of equations: \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =-3\\\\ 2x-3y+2z &amp; =13\\\\ -x+5y-4z &amp; =-19 \\end{align*}\\] The corresponding augmented matrix for this system is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; -3 &amp; 2\\\\ -1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 13\\\\ -19 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] The first row comprises the three coefficients of \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\,\\left(1,2,-1\\right)\\) and the right hand side \\(\\left(-3\\right)\\) from the first equation. The second row comprises the three coefficients of \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\,\\left(2,-3,2\\right)\\) and the right hand side \\(\\left(13\\right)\\) from the second equation. The third row comprises the three coefficients of \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\,\\left(-1,4,-4\\right)\\) and the right hand side \\(\\left(-19\\right)\\) from the third equation. The vertical line indicates this is an augmented matrix and should be included. Otherwise it would look like a \\(3\\times4\\) matrix.   Elementary Row Operations Elementary row operations are operations that can be used to simplify an augmented matrix when solving systems of equations. Allowable elementary row operations are:  Interchange any two rows. Multiply a row by any constant. Add or subtract a multiple of one row to another row.    Solving Equations The method is as follows:  Create the augmented matrix Use row operations to reduce the augmented matrix to the following form  1Note that you must get the zeros under the diagonal elements by working from left to right. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c\\\\ 0 &amp; e &amp; f\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; h \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} d\\\\ g\\\\ k \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Note that the entries below the main diagonal are zero.  From row \\(3\\) we have \\(hz=k\\) and so \\(z=k\/h.\\) From row \\(2\\) we have \\(ey+fz=g.\\) Since \\(z\\) is known (from Step 3), this can be arranged to find \\(y.\\) From row \\(1\\) we have \\(ax+by+cz=d.\\) Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are known from steps \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) we can find \\(x.\\)  Steps \\(3\\) to \\(5\\) are called back substitution.  Example 1 Solve the following for \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =-3 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 2x-3y+2z &amp; =13 &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ -x+5y-4z &amp; =-19. &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The augmented matrix is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; -3 &amp; 2\\\\ -1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 13\\\\ -19 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We now use row operations to get zeroes in row \\(2\\) and row \\(3\\) of column \\(1\\). We do this by multiplying row \\(1\\) \\(\\left(R_{1}\\right)\\) by 2 and subtracting it from row \\(2\\) \\(\\left(R_{2}\\right)\\) to get:2 We will work from left to right. \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -7 &amp; 4\\\\ -1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 19\\\\ -19 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now, to get a zero in row \\(3\\) column \\(1,\\) we add rows \\(1\\) and 3 to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -7 &amp; 4\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 19\\\\ -22 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Next we get a zero in row \\(3\\), column \\(1\\) by adding rows \\(2\\) and \\(3:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -7 &amp; 4\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 19\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we can start the back substitution. From row \\(3\\) we have \\(-1z=-3\\) so \\(z=3.\\) From row \\(2\\) we have \\(-7y+4z=19\\). Substituting for \\(z\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} -7y+4z &amp; =19\\\\ -7y+4\\left(3\\right) &amp; =19\\\\ -7y &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(1\\) we have \\(x+2y-z=-3\\). Substituting for \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =-3\\\\ x+2\\left(-1\\right)-3 &amp; =-3\\\\ x-5 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] The solution to the simultaneous equations is therefore, \\(x=2,\\,y=-1,\\,z=3\\). Note that you can check your solution by substituting the values for \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) in the original equations. For example the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =2+2\\left(-1\\right)-3\\\\ &amp; =2-2-3\\\\ &amp; =-3\\\\ &amp; =RHS. \\end{align*}\\] The left hand side of equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} 2x-3y+2z &amp; =2(2)-3\\left(-1\\right)+2\\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =4+3+6\\\\ &amp; =13\\\\ &amp; =RHS. \\end{align*}\\] Finally, the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} -x+5y-4z &amp; =-2+5\\left(-1\\right)-4\\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-2-5-12\\\\ &amp; =-19\\\\ &amp; =RHS. \\end{align*}\\]   Example 2 Solve the following simultaneous equations for \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-y+2z &amp; =3\\\\ 2y-5z &amp; =-1\\\\ x+y+z &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The augmented matrix is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 4 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We first interchange rows \\(1\\)and \\(3.\\) This puts a one in the top left corner of the matrix and makes the arithmetic easier: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}'=R_{3}\\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ 3 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We now want a zero in the first position of row \\(3\\). We subtract \\(3R_{1}\\) from \\(R_{3}\\)to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-3R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 0 &amp; -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ -9 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we want a zero in row \\(3\\)column \\(2\\). We get this by adding \\(2R_{2}\\) to \\(R_{3}\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+2R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -5\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -11 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ -11 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(3\\), \\(-11z=-11\\) so \\(z=1.\\) From row \\(2\\) and substituting \\(z=1\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y-5z &amp; =-1\\\\ 2y-5\\left(1\\right) &amp; =-1\\\\ 2y &amp; =4\\\\ y &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(3\\) and substituting for \\(x\\)and \\(y\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-y+2z &amp; =3\\\\ 3x-2+2\\left(1\\right) &amp; =3\\\\ 3x &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution is \\(x=1,\\,y=2\\) and \\(z=1.\\)   Example 3 Solve the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x-2y+2z &amp; =-6\\\\ 3x+4y+z &amp; =-2\\\\ 2x+6y+3z &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The augmented matrix is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; -2 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -6\\\\ -2\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] The first step is to try and get a 1 in the top left hand corner of the matrix. In example 2 we did that by interchanging rows. In this case, that won\u2019t work. However row \\(1\\) can be divided by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}'=R_{1}\/2\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ -2\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we proceed in the usual way. In this example we do not put in all the comments. \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-3R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-2R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=7R_{3}-8R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 23 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] From \\(R_{3}\\)we have \\(23z=0\\) and so \\(z=0.\\) Substituting this into \\(R_{2}\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y-2z &amp; =7\\\\ 7y-2\\left(0\\right) &amp; =7\\\\ 7y &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(z=0,\\,y=1\\) into \\(R_{1}\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} x-y+z &amp; =-3\\\\ x-1+0 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=-2,\\,y=1,\\,z=0\\).    Infinite Number of Solutions In all the examples above we had a unique solution. That is, \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) were associated with a single number. It is possible that a set of simultaneous equations has an infinite number of solutions. Imagine after using row operations you get an augmented matrix like \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c\\\\ 0 &amp; e &amp; f\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} d\\\\ g\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In this case \\(R_{3}\\) tells us nothing. We basically have \\(2\\) equations and \\(3\\) unknowns. In this case we will have an infinite number of solutions and the variables \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) will be in terms of some parameter. The following example illustrates this case.  Example 4 Solve the following set of equations: \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ 2x-y+z &amp; =5\\\\ 3x+2z &amp; =8. \\end{align*}\\] Solution: The augmented matrix is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 5\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Performing row operations we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-3R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We can go no further with elementary row operations and so start back substitution. Row \\(3\\) tells us nothing. From row \\(2\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} -3y-z &amp; =-1\\\\ 3y+z &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] This is an equation with two unknowns. In this case we let one of the variables, either \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be free. That is we let \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be equal to some parameter \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). It doesn\u2019t matter which variable you choose to be free, though the answer will look different. We will set \\(z=t\\) then we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+z &amp; =1\\\\ 3y+t &amp; =1\\\\ 3y &amp; =1-t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1-t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(1\\) and substituting \\(z=t\\) and \\(y=\\left(1-t\\right)\/3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ x+\\frac{1-t}{3}+t &amp; =3\\\\ 3x+1-t+3t &amp; =9\\\\ 3x &amp; =8-2t\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution here is \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3},y=\\frac{1-t}{3},z=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] This gives us an infinite number of solutions because \\(t\\) can be any real number. To check the solution you can pick any value of \\(t,\\)determine \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) and substitute in the original equations. For example let \\(t=0\\).3 Here we took \\(t=0\\) because it is easy to get the corresponding \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values. But you can pick any value of \\(t\\). Once you choose \\(t\\), there will be a corresponding value of \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z.\\) These \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values will satisfy the original equations.

However, there is multiplication by the inverse.\n\nKeywords(tags): Maths, Matrices\n\n\n\n   In matrix algebra, we can add, subtract and multiply matrices subject to conditions on the matrix shape (or order). While matrix algebra does not have a division operation, there is multiplication by the inverse matrix. This module discuses the concept of an inverse matrix.   Definition Let \\(I\\) denote the identity matrix. That is the matrix containing ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. That is \\[\\begin{align*} I_{1}=\\left[1\\right],\\;I_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(A\\) is a square matrix and \\(B\\) is another square matrix of the same order such that \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =BA=I \\end{align*}\\] then we call \\(B\\) the inverse of \\(A.\\) The inverse of \\(A\\) is denoted by the symbol \\(A^{-1}\\).1 Note that \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; \\neq\\frac{1}{A} \\end{align*}\\] as division is not defined in matrix algebra. Hence \\[\\begin{align*} AA^{-1} &amp; =A^{-1}A=I. \\end{align*}\\] Not every square matrix has an inverse. If the determinant of a matrix equals zero, the inverse does not exist and the matrix is called singular. If the determinant is unequal to zero the inverse exists and we call the matrix non-singular or invertible.   Inverse of a \\(2\\times2\\) Matrix If \\(A\\) is a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix, then \\(A^{-1}\\) is also a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix such that: \\[\\begin{align*} AA^{-1} &amp; =A^{-1}A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] There is a simple formula to find the matrix of a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix.   Let \\[\\begin{align*} A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] then the inverse matrix of \\(A\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b\\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]   Note that \\(ad-bc\\) is the determinant of the matrix \\(A.\\) That is \\(ad-bc=\\det A=\\left|A\\right|\\). So we can also write \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\det A}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b\\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(\\det A=0,\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{0}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b\\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] But \\(1\/0\\) is undefined and so the inverse does not exist.  Example 1 Find the inverse of the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Solution: First check if \\(A\\) is singular. \\[\\begin{align*} \\det A &amp; =2\\times4-2\\times3\\\\ &amp; =8-6\\\\ &amp; =2 \\end{align*}\\] so \\(A\\) is not singular and the inverse exists. Using the formula above, \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\det A}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\/2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Check \\(AA^{-1}=I\\) and \\(A^{-1}A=I.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} AA^{-1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\/2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2+3\\times\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 2\\times\\left(-3\/2\\right)+3\\times1\\\\ 2\\times2+4\\times\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 2\\times\\left(-3\/2\\right)+4\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ A^{-1}A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\/2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2+\\left(-3\/2\\right)\\times2 &amp; 2\\times3+\\left(-3\/2\\right)\\times4\\\\ -1\\times2+1\\times2 &amp; \\left(-1\\right)\\times3+1\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(A^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\/2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) is the inverse of \\(A.\\)   Example 2 Find the inverse of the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Solution: The determinant, \\[\\begin{align*} \\det A &amp; =-1\\times3-\\left(-2\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-3-\\left(-8\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5 \\end{align*}\\] so the matrix \\(A\\) has an inverse. Using the formula, \\[\\begin{align*} A^{-1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{\\det A}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Check \\(AA^{-1}=I\\) and \\(A^{-1}A=I.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} AA^{-1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -3+8 &amp; -2+2\\\\ 12-12 &amp; 8-3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ A^{-1}A &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -3+8 &amp; -6+6\\\\ 4-4 &amp; 8-3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So \\(A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right].\\)   Example 3 Find the inverse of the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 3 &amp; 2\\\\ 6 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right].\\) Solution: The determinant of \\(A\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} \\det A &amp; =3\\times4-6\\times2\\\\ &amp; =12-12\\\\ &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Since \\(\\det A=0,\\)the matrix \\(A\\) does not have an inverse.

As each new chunk is introduced students are supported in organising the new learning and language into an appropriate and retrievable place in their 'mental filing cabinet' or fit into their existing 'schemas'. Some suggested strategies for doing this are:  reinforcing and remembering key language and main points at the end of the class or topic building key language and concepts at the beginning of the class.    Looking forward &rarr; introduce key language &amp; concepts Looking forward &ndash; build key language and concepts at the beginning of the class Before starting a new topic, it is often a good idea to ask students what they already know about it. It is easier for all of us to understand (and therefore remember) information that links to ideas or concepts that we already know something about, even if we only know a little bit. So when beginning a new topic, focusing on its concepts and language in relation to what students already know helps them to learn. There are many ways to do this. One common method is a brainstorm at the beginning of the lesson.  'Bankruptcy' example For instance, a teacher commencing a lesson on the business laws of 'Bankruptcy' might start by announcing that today's lesson is about 'Bankruptcy', writing the word in the centre of the board and asking the students to brainstorm what they know, or have heard, about it. As students tell their stories or offer suggestions about what it means, the teacher would write them on the board, highlight important terminology, and link together different words for similar concepts, for example, 'closing down', 'winding up' and 'liquidation'. The differences between 'personal' and 'company' bankruptcy are likely to emerge from the stories offered by the students and new related language and concepts can be introduced and written on the board by building on their input as they speak  Actively engage students   Active engagement of students This process actively engages students by asking them to contribute. It allows the teacher to collect and emphasize relevant vocabulary and to link it to student language via their examples and anecdotes. The students collectively build their understanding and language of bankruptcy. If formal input from reading material or teacher presentation follows this, then it is more likely to connect with prior understanding and existing language brought into focus at the focus at the beginning of the session. These preparatory activities help to actively engage students by giving them a way in to the content. Provide a brief overview It also helps to give students a brief overview of the key topics or learning outcomes of a session so that they can develop an organisational framework for their thinking during the class and for studying afterwards. It is best to keep the overview down to about three items, however. Otherwise students may be overwhelmed and it becomes less useful.  Looking back - reinforce key language and concepts at the end of a class At the end of a session or topic a useful revision strategy is to spend 5-10 minutes encouraging students to tell you the key points or main ideas as a way of reinforcing understanding and memory. Looking back &rarr; revise key points at the end of the lesson Reinforce new language As you do this you can prompt them to use any new language they have learned during the session. Explaining to each other You might also ask students to explain the main points to each other in pairs or small groups before doing the exercise as a whole class. This type of speaking activity is valuable because unless students can explain the main points of a topic or session it is unlikely that they really understand it. As a teacher you can also gain important feedback about your students' understanding of content and language. Also this embedded 'looking back' revision strategy is useful for building students' independent learning competencies as the course progresses.

Many students think that they have to read every word rather than using the important skills of 'skimming and scanning' so that they easily locate the information that they need. If you want students to learn from written material it is a good idea to spend time consciously teaching them how to read actively and effectively. The first step is to encourage VET learners to engage with their textbooks and manuals so they can 'skim and scan' effectively by becoming familiar with the structure of the text. To help them, you can go through the structure of their text or manuals together and give them pointers for using them effectively.It is useful to highlight the following:   Show students how to skim &amp; scan their textbooks Headings and sub headings are a useful guide to what is important in any given topic. They give the reader an understanding of how the content and content chunks are organised.  Glossaries or lists of new words \/ terminology and their meanings are often included in textbooks. Encouraging students to compile a class or individual glossary during the course is a very useful teaching and learning strategy. Teach students 'how' to read their textbook Summaries or overviews: Some texts have summaries or main points at the beginning or end of chapters. If so, encourage students to read them first to get an overview of the topic and to gain an understanding of the key points to be covered.  Index and chapter headings assist students to locate information easily for revision or cross checking. Often students don't know where an index is in their textbook and how to use it. Some initial activities that use the index during class time are helpful in encouraging students to use their text book \/ manual more effectively.  Use quizzes to check understanding Questions and answers may be included in a section of text, for example after a chapter or unit of work. Students need to know where to find the answers easily &ndash; they could perhaps place a marker or sticker in the page for easy reference. Use quizzes &ndash; both oral and written during or after reading or theory sessions. This is a good way to check the students' understanding of a topic area or unit of work.

The activities involve taking key words, technical terms or concept names out of a text, leaving gaps to be filled.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloze (fill in the gaps) activities are a great way to help students focus on key language in their vocational course. The activities involve taking key words, technical terms or concept names out of a text, leaving gaps to be filled. The students fill in (close) the gaps by predicting the correct term from a selection provided underneath or above the text. See examples below. Uses of cloze activities Cloze activities can be used in a variety of ways, for instance:  as a note taking strategy during teacher presentations or lectures, to reinforce and break up reading, especially if using self paced materials, for recall of key points and terminology at the end of a session or for general revision of a unit of work, to promote student discussion and peer learning if used with pairs or small groups of students.  Benefits of cloze activities Cloze activities have a number of benefits. They:  allow students to make their own meaning from a piece of text or theory, engage students in active learning and so appeal to those who prefer to 'learn by doing' or writing, rather than just reading, highlight key terminology and concepts for students.  Developing a cloze activity for your teaching Take a passage from your text, handbook or manual, and photocopy or retype it. Highlight key terminology that has been introduced during class and which you wish to reinforce or emphasise. Put this key terminology above or below the text in random order within a box. Delete or white it out the terms you have selected. This works best if the terms are somehow explained by other words in the text. It is best to use this as a pair or small group activity so that students can clarify their understandings with each other. If there is no passage of text that seems suitable then create one of your own which focuses on critical terminology and its meaning. Sample cloze activities for professional development sessions Fears &amp; phobias Fill in the gaps from the words below in the following text about fears &amp; phobias The only thing to fear is fear itself, not so apparently for a significant section of the population. In fact most people experience fears of one kind or another. Fears that are long lasting are called phobias and are basically a form of anxiety disorder which can curtail a person's happiness and life's choices. Some common well known phobias are ______________ or a fear of open spaces or for those who are crippled with fear when anywhere near water, ___________In fact one solution to a well known phobia which affects a lot of people_________, is to put mirrors in lifts. Less common phobias are conditions like___________ or fear of disease. Others experience monophobia, a fear of being alone, or ___________ a fear of public speaking. Some unusual phobias that affect daily life are ____________a fear of clothes, _____________a fear of nudity or _____________a fear of washing. There are of course common phobias that sometimes develop in childhood like ______________ the fear of going to bed. The good thing though is that most of us have got over our earlier phobias, particularly_______________ which is fear of the bogey man. Unfortunately there are phobias that can be difficult to overcome and can be long lasting. You may know someone who has _______________ and hence finds it difficult to be on time for anything! A more serious phobia is ____________ a fear of food and is often associated with anorexia and certainly proves how destructive phobias can be! Memory Put the following words and phrases in the correct spaces in the sentence:  Little ideas Bottleneck big idea associated paying attention bottleneck problem Chunking conscious schemas  Two types of memory It appears that the memory functions of our brain are divided into two parts which are called short term memory and long term memory. Short term memory is primarily used for _________________ and is the _____________ part of our mind whereas _____________________ is used for storage so that you can retrieve information in the future. Memory problems Only 5-7 pieces of information can be transferred from short term memory to long term memory at a time.

Memory strategies __________________ is an effective method to get around the bottleneck problem. This involves organising a number of ________________ or bits of information into a _________________ so that it is easier to remember.

Like and Unlike Terms Like terms contain exactly the same pro-numerals1 A pro-numeral is a combination of letters, symbols and numbers. For example, \\(3x\\) is a pro-numeral. In algebra, when we write \\(3x\\) we really mean \\(3\\times x\\). Another example of a pro-numeral is \\(5ab\\). This means \\(5\\times a\\times b\\). Note that \\(5ab=5ba\\). The order of the letters and numbers is not important but usually we write numbers first and use alphabetical order for the letters. While \\(5ba\\) is correct, it is more common to write \\(5ab\\).. The following table gives some examples of like and unlike terms.    Like Terms Unlike Terms     \\(3x,5x\\) \\(3x,5y\\)   \\(2a,-3a\\) \\(3a,3\\)   \\(m^{2},7m^{2}\\) \\(m^{2},7m\\)   \\(2ab,3ab\\) \\(2a^{2}b,3ab^{2}\\)   \\(3xyz,5xyz\\) \\(3xyz,3xy\\)   \\(3ef,3fe\\) \\(3ef,\\,3eg\\)   \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\), \\(\\beta\\alpha\\) \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\), \\(6\\alpha\\beta\\)    For some practice, please go to Exercise 1 below.   Addition and Subtraction The essential rule is:   Only like terms may be added or subtracted.   Example 1. \\[\\begin{align*} 7e+10e &amp; =7\\times e+10\\times e\\\\ &amp; =\\left(7+10\\right)e\\\\ &amp; =17e. \\end{align*}\\] In practice we would not put in the first line. It is included to reinforce what \\(7e\\) and \\(10e\\) mean. In practice we would probably go straight to the answer. That is \\(7e+10e=17e\\). Example 2. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x^{2}-x^{2}-4x^{2} &amp; =\\left(3-1-4\\right)x^{2}\\\\ &amp; =-2x^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Example 3. 2 This example shows how we can gather different like terms. In this case \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). \\[\\begin{align*} 3m-4n+6m+n &amp; =\\left(3+6\\right)m+\\left(-4+1\\right)n\\\\ &amp; =9m-3n. \\end{align*}\\] Example 4. \\[\\begin{align*} 3a-b-5a+4ab-3b+ab &amp; =\\left(3-5\\right)a+\\left(-1-3\\right)b+\\left(4+1\\right)ab\\\\ &amp; =-2a-4b+5ab. \\end{align*}\\] Example 5. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-x^{2} &amp; \\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\end{align*}\\] Example 6. \\[\\begin{align*} p+2p-3 &amp; =3p-3. \\end{align*}\\] Example 7. \\[ 8uv+3u-10vu=-2uv+3u. \\] Example 8. \\[ 6r^{2}s-2rs^{2}\\quad\\mathrm{there\\textrm{ are no like terms so nothing can be done.}} \\] For some practice, please go to Exercise 2 below.   Multiplication Both like and unlike terms may be multiplied. When multiplying two or more terms consider: 1. The sign of the answer.3 In doing the multiplication, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the product. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\times\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\]  The product of the terms.  Here are some examples: \\[\\begin{array}{l} 1.\\quad\\left(-4\\right)\\times\\left(-3b\\right)=12b\\\\ 2.\\quad-2\\times6y=-12y\\\\ 3.\\quad2e\\times\\left(-5e^{2}\\right)=-10e^{3}\\\\ 4.\\quad\\left(-2u^{2}v\\right)\\times\\left(-4v\\right)=8u^{2}v^{2}\\\\ 5.\\quad-3pq\\times\\left(-2q\\right)\\times p=6p^{2}q^{2} \\end{array}\\]   Division In algebra, we often use fractions. For example:4 In this case the top term, 2 is called the numerator, the bottom term 5, is called the denominator and the horizontal line between them is called the fraction bar, division bar or vinculum. \\[ \\frac{2}{5}=2\\div5. \\] Similarly for algebraic terms: \\[ \\frac{2x^{2}yz}{3xy^{2}}=2x^{2}yz\\div3xy^{2}. \\] When dividing algebraic terms:  Rewrite as a fraction if necessary Expand any powers Establish the sign of the answer5 In doing the division, remember the basic rules for determining the sign of the quotient. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(+ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(+ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(-ve\\right)\\\\ \\left(-ve\\right)\\div\\left(-ve\\right) &amp; =\\left(+ve\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Cancel any common factors   Examples  Divide \\(-12wyz\\) by \\(3yz\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} -12wyz\\div3yz &amp; =\\frac{-12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{12wyz}{3yz}\\quad\\textrm{determine sign}\\\\ &amp; =-4w\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\] Divide \\(2m^{2}n\\) by \\(-6mn^{2}\\). Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2m^{2}n\\div6mn^{2} &amp; =\\frac{2m^{2}n}{-6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2m^{2}n}{6mn^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{m}{3n}. \\end{align*}\\] Simplify \\(6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab.\\) Solution: \\[\\begin{align*} 6a^{2}\\times4ab\\div12ab &amp; =\\frac{6a^{2}\\times4ab}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{write as a fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{24a^{3}b}{12ab}\\quad\\textrm{establish sign and expand powers}\\\\ &amp; =2a^{2}\\quad\\textrm{cancel common factors}. \\end{align*}\\] Divide \\(m+2\\) by \\(4m\\) \\[ \\left(m+2\\right)\\div4m=\\frac{m+2}{4m}. \\] There are no common factors and so it is not possible to simplify further.  For practice examples see Exercise 3.    Order of Operations The basic operations of arithmetic are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. Usually the order in which we perform the operations is important.  For example, what is the answer to the following arithmetic problem \\[ 4+3\\times2+5\\;? \\] At first sight there are several possible answers. Working from left to right we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times2+5\\\\ &amp; =14+5\\\\ &amp; =19. \\end{align*}\\] Working from right to left we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+3\\times7\\\\ &amp; =4+21\\\\ &amp; =25. \\end{align*}\\] If we do the multiplication first we get another answer: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\\\ &amp; =15. \\end{align*}\\] Yet another answer is obtained by doing the additions first: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times7\\\\ &amp; =49. \\end{align*}\\] Mathematicians don\u2019t like imprecision. In order to allow only one answer to the problem we perform operations in the following order:  Brackets Indices Multiplication and Division from left to right Addition and Subtraction  Using the first letters (bold) we get the abbreviation BIMDAS. Applying this rule the answer to our problem is \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\quad\\textrm{multiplication first}\\\\ &amp; =15\\quad\\textrm{then addition}. \\end{align*}\\]  Examples:  \\(3\\times2+4=6+4=10.\\) \\(3+2\\times4=3+8=11\\). \\(\\left(3+2\\right)\\times4=5\\times4=20.\\) \\(3-2^{2}=3-2\\times2=3-4=-1\\). \\(\\left(3-2\\right)^{2}=\\left(3-2\\right)\\times\\left(3-2\\right)=1\\times1=1\\). \\(3^{2}-2^{2}=3\\times3-2\\times2=9-4=5\\). \\(3st-3s\\times4t=3st-12st=-9st\\).  For some practice, see Exercise 4.    Exercise 1 Which of the five terms on the right is a like term with the term on the left? \\[\\begin{array}{llllllll} 1) &amp; 3x &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 2x &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 2xy &amp; 4x^{2}a\\\\ 2) &amp; 2ab &amp; | &amp; 2a &amp; 2b &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 6abc &amp; 12ab\\\\ 3) &amp; 2x^{2} &amp; | &amp; x &amp; 2x &amp; 5x^{2} &amp; 4x &amp; 4x^{3}\\\\ 4) &amp; 3xy^{2} &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 3xy &amp; 3x^{2}xy^{2} &amp; 3y^{2} &amp; 3y^{2}x\\\\ 5) &amp; 2m^{2}n &amp; | &amp; n &amp; mn^{2} &amp; 8mn &amp; 2m^{2} &amp; 4nm^{2}\\\\ 6) &amp; 4ab^{2}c &amp; | &amp; 4 &amp; 2ab^{2}c &amp; 4abc &amp; 8b^{2}c &amp; 4cba \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 2 Simplify each of the following: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 1. &amp; &amp; a)\\;13x+4-3x-1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;10mn+5m+12mn+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;3xy^{2}+2xy+5xy^{2}+3xy &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;5xy+6m-2xy-2m\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;x+y+2x-y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3a+5b-a-6b\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;x+4y-x-2y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;7x-4m-5x-3m\\\\ &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-5x-3y+5x &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\] Simplify each of the following: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 2. &amp; &amp; a)\\;13x+4-3x-1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;10mn+5m+12mn+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;3xy^{2}+2xy+5xy^{2}+3xy &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;5xy+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;x+y+2x-y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3a+5b-a-6b\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;x+4y-x-2y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;7x-4m-5x-3m\\\\ &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-4x-3y+5x &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 3 Simplify the following algebraic expressions: \\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 1. &amp; &amp; a)\\;5\\times2k &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;4a\\times3ab\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;y\\times3y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;4m\\times\\left(-3mn\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;m\\times39\\times5 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;2ab\\times3bc\\times\\left(-4\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;2ab^{2}\\times3ac &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4m\\times\\left(-5kmp\\right)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 2. &amp; &amp; a)\\;18ef\\div6f &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;-100uvw\\div100w\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;24gh^{2}\\div8gh &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;3m^{2}n\\div12mn^{2}\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;rs\\times2st\\div2s &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3jk\\times12km\\div9jkm\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;10p\\times3qp\\div16pq &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4yz\\times5w^{2}z\\div10wy \\end{array}\\]   Exercise 4 Simplify the following expressions: \\[\\begin{array}{lllll} 1)\\;18\\times\\left(3\\times\\left(-5\\right)\\right) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 2)\\;3\\times\\left(-4\\right)+\\left(8\\times2\\right)\\\\ 3)\\;10-5^{2}+3 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 4)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}+3\\\\ 5)\\;10^{2}-5^{2} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 6)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}\\\\ 7)\\;3m+2\\times3m &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 8)\\;6ab-3a\\times4b\\\\ 9)\\;16gh-4gh\\times4 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 10)\\;9b-3b\\times2k+2k\\times b \\end{array}\\]         Download this page, A1.1 Algebraic Operations (PDF 231KB)   ","excerpt":"nodeID: 1345 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Keywords(tags): A page from Al-Khwarizmis \u201cal-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-gabr wa-l-muqabala\u201d, an early book on algebra.

Force equals mass times acceleration. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nKeywords(tags): \n\n\n\n @import url(\"https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/images\/enhanced\/maths.css\"); #content-area .video-accordion .panel { margin: 20px 0 !important; }     What are Newton\u2019s first 3 laws?  An object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Force \\(\\left(F\\right)\\) equals mass \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) times acceleration \\(\\left(a\\right)\\). That is \\(F=ma\\). For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.    Net (sum of the forces or resultant) force is represented by \\(\\Sigma F\\) Examples    \\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Right \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the right      \\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Left \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the left      \\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-150=0\\) Newton \\(\\therefore\\) balanced force so is stationary or moving at a constant speed No acceleration but could be at rest or moving at constant velocity (remember F=ma so no acceleration but it could be moving)     Note : Force is a vector quantity, so direction must be taken into consideration.     Newtons Laws of Motion  Newtons 1st law of motion Every object continues to be at rest, or continues with constant velocity, unless it experiences an unbalanced force. Seatbelts are fitted in cars to take into account Newtons 1st Law of Motion. If, for instance, you had to brake suddenly and you were not wearing your seatbelt, then by Newtons 1st Law, you would continue to travel at a uniform speed \u2013 the speed of the car just before braking \u2013 until you made contact with the windscreen. That is, the sum of the forces acting on you was zero at the instant you braked even though the car was being acted upon by a braking force. The windscreen would then exert a force on you as you hit it. As it did to the author of this worksheet when he was 13 years old.   Newtons 2nd law of motion This law relates to the (sum of \\(\\Sigma\\) ) the (forces F) written as \\(\\Sigma F\\) s acting on an object and the acceleration produced as a consequence of this resultant force. It is given by:   Sum of the Forces = \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\)   where \\(\\Sigma F\\) is the sum of the forces (in Newtons), \u2018m\u2019 is the mass of the object (in\\(kg\\)), and \u2018a\u2019 is the acceleration (in \\(ms^{-2}\\)). Note: \\(\\Sigma F\\) must have the same direction as acceleration as force is also a vector. When doing Newtons 2nd law problems, draw all forces acting on the object in question.   Example 1 A toy car of mass \\(2kg\\) has a driving force \\(F_{D}\\) of \\(20N\\). The frictional force \\(F_{F}\\) acting on the car is \\(10Newton\\). Find the cars acceleration  Solution: The net force acting on the car is the driving force minus the frictional force: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =F_{D}-F_{F}\\\\ &amp; =20-10\\\\ &amp; =10N. \\end{align*}\\] Using Newton\u2019s 2nd law1 The second law is: \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} ma &amp; =10\\\\ 2a &amp; =10\\\\ a &amp; =5ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] The magnitude of the car\u2019s acceleration is \\(5ms^{-2}\\).   Newton\u2019s 3rd law of motion When two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal in size, but opposite in direction. These pairs of forces are called action-reaction forces. You need to appreciate that each force in the action-reaction pair acts on different objects. This is different to Newtons 2nd law where you analyze forces that are acting on the same object. Note that each force is equal in size but opposite in direction to its paired force.    Normal force \\(F_{N}\\) A normal force acts at right angles to the surface with which it is in contact. For instance, if you are currently sitting on a chair reading this handout, then the chair is in contact with the floor and so there is a contact force of the chair acting on the floor given by \\(F_{CF}\\). By Newtons 3rd law the floor will exert an equal but opposite force on the chair of \\(F_{FC}\\). \\(F_{FC}\\) is also called the normal force \\(F_{N}\\). If this is not the case then you will either fall through the floor or fly up into the sky. See diagram below.  \\(F_{FC}=\\) \\(-\\) \\(F_{CF}\\) where the negative sign indicates that these forces are acting in opposite directions. Recall your notes on vectors. The magnitude of the forces are equal but the direction is opposite.   Applications of Newtons laws. A starting point when analyzing Newtons 2nd law problems is to draw all forces acting on the object in question.  Objects in Lifts   If accelerating down (as shown): \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ mg-F &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\]  Accelerating down then gravity is winning or larger. Accelerating up then Normal force is winning or larger. Acceleration has magnitude and is directional , it is a vector. where \\(g\\) is the acceleration of gravity (see diagram)  If accelerating up: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\] If not accelerating at all:2 It is stationary or moving at a constant velocity. \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N} &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\]    Objects Bouncing  During the bounce (the instant the ball is in contact with the surface):  \\(F_{N}\\) &gt; mg, because a &gt; 0 and is upwards. Therefore there is a resultant force acting which is upwards (as the ball will now head up). \\(F_{N}\\) can often be much larger than mg (for the ball to bounce). At the instant the object is stationary  (just before it changes direction and heads up) \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N} &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\]   Object being pulled along a surface \\(T\\) = tension in rope , \\(a\\) = acceleration of object , \\(m\\) = mass of object, \\(F_{N}\\) is the normal force of the table pushing on the block, \\(mg\\) is the force of the block pushing on the table. Remember that \\(g\\) is acceleration of gravity, \\(F_{f}\\) is the force of friction the table exerts on the object      Horizontally: \\(\\Sigma F\\)= \\(T\\) \\(=\\) \\(ma\\) Vertically: \\(\\Sigma F=F_{N}-mg=0\\) Therefore \\(F_{N}=\\) \\(mg\\)      Horizontally: \\(\\sum F\\)= T - \\(F_{f}\\)=\\(ma\\) Vertically: \\(\\sum F=F_{N}-mg=0\\) Therefore \\(F_{N}=\\) \\(mg\\)     Example: A car of mass 800kg accelerates from rest to \\(20\\) \\(ms^{-1}\\) in \\(\\text{$8.0\\sec$ }\\). The resistance forces acting on the car total \\(1000N\\). Find (a) the acceleration of the car, and (b) the driving force of the car.   Acceleration is given by the change in velocity divided by the time taken, or  remember \u201cfrom rest\u201d means \\(u=0\\), final velocity is \\(v=20\\) and time \\(t=8\\) \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{v-u}{t}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{20-0}{8}\\\\ &amp; =2.5ms^{-2} \\end{align*}\\]  Net Force \\(\\Sigma F=F_{D}-F_{F}=ma\\)  Therefore \\[\\begin{align*} F_{D}-F_{F} &amp; =m\\times a\\\\ F_{D}-1000 &amp; =800\\times2.5\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =800\\times2.5+1000\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =2000+1000\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =3000N \\end{align*}\\] The driving force of the car is therefore \\(3000\\) Newton.    Exercise  What resultant force is needed to give a mass of 6.4 kg an acceleration of\\(2.4\\) \\(ms^{-2}\\) West?

This occurs when the sum of the forces on it in each direction is zero and the sum of the torques in each direction is zero. So there are two types of static equilibrium: translational equilibrium and rotational equilibrium.  Translational Equilibrium Translational equilibrium means that the sum of the forces (or net force) acting on the system is zero, ie, sum of the forces is zero \\(\\sum F\\) \\(=0,\\)we divide all forces into horizontal and vertical components or:   Forces up = Forces down Forces left = Forces right     Example 1 Consider a hanging set of traffic lights of mass \\(m\\) suspended above an intersection by a pair of wires of negligible mass, as shown below. It is easiest to break up the forces to vertical and horizontal forces.  Since this structure is in equilibrium the magnitude of the components of forces upwards must equal the magnitude of the components of forces downwards, or Forces up = Forces down (there is no vertical motion) Resolving \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) vertically in the diagram above: \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{forces Up} &amp; =\\textrm{forces Down}\\\\ T_{1}\\sin30+T_{2}\\sin60 &amp; =W\\\\ T_{1}\\sin30+T_{2}\\sin60 &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, we could resolve \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) horizontally. Forces left = Forces right (there is no horizontal motion) Resolving \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{2}\\) horizontally in the diagram above: Note that vertical weight force W (=mg) when resolved horizontally equals zero or \\(W\\) \\(\\cos90=0\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{forces left} &amp; =\\textrm{forces right}\\\\ T_{1}\\cos30^{\\circ} &amp; =T_{2}\\cos60^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\]   Rotational Equilibrium Torque or Moment of a Force is the turning effect or torque \\(\\tau\\) of a force F acting at a distance\\(r\\) from the axis of rotation of a rigid body is given by    \\(\\tau=F\\times r\\)   where \\(F\\) and \\(r\\) are mutually perpendicular (at right angles) to each other. For rotational equilibrium to occur the sum of the torques (or net torque) acting on the structure is zero, ie \\(\\sum\\tau=0\\), (sum of \\(\\tau\\) = 0) or   Clockwise Torques = Counterclockwise Torques     Example 2 Consider the seesaw example below.  For translational equilibrium: \\(\\Sigma F=0\\) or \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Forces Up} &amp; =\\textrm{Forces Down}\\\\ F_{R} &amp; =F_{1}+F_{2} \\end{align*}\\] For rotational equilibrium: \\(\\Sigma\\tau=0\\) (when a seesaw is not moving) or \\[\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Clockwise Torque} &amp; =\\textrm{CounterClockwise Torque}\\\\ F_{2}\\times x_{2} &amp; =F_{1}\\times x_{1} \\end{align*}\\] An example of a system that is not in rotational equilibrium is a moving see-saw.

Exercises Use \\(g=9.8\\) \\(ms^{-2}\\)  In Example 1, \\(T_{1}\\) \\(=1000N\\), and \\(T_{2}\\) \\(=2000N\\).

A picture is hung as shown in the following diagram.   If the hanging wire has a breaking strength of \\(40N\\), what is the maximum possible mass of the picture?  A \\(100\\,gram\\) electric light is supported by two cables, one at an angle of \\(60{^\\circ}\\) with the ceiling, and the other being perpendicular to the wall.   Assuming the mass of each cable is negligible, calculate the tension in each cable.  Two children are balanced on a see-saw which is supported in the middle.

Change in Momentum Consider an object of mass \u2018m\u2019 changing from \\(v_{i}\\) to \\(v_{f}\\) in time \\(\\varDelta t\\) under the action of a resultant force \\(\\sum F\\). From Newton\u2019s second law of motion \\(\\sum F=m\\times a\\) and the fact that acceleration is \\(a=\\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{\\varDelta t}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\sum F &amp; =m\\times a\\\\ &amp; =m(\\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{\\varDelta t})\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{mv_{f}-mv_{i}}{\\varDelta t}\\\\ &amp; \\textrm{This transposes to the equation:} \\end{align*}\\]  \\[\\begin{align*} \\sum F\\times\\varDelta t &amp; =mv_{f}-mv_{i} \\end{align*}\\]  In other words, when a resultant force \\(\\sum F\\) acts on an object for a time duration of \\(\\varDelta t\\) there is a change in momentum given by ( \\(mv_{f}-mv_{i}\\)), where \\(mv_{i}\\) is the initial momentum and \\(mv_{f}\\) is the final momentum. This change in momentum is written as \\(\\varDelta p\\) , or  \\[\\begin{align*} \\varDelta p &amp; =p_{f}-p_{i}\\\\ &amp; =mv_{f}-mv_{i} \\end{align*}\\]  Where \\(p_{i}\\) is the initial momentum and \\(p_{f}\\) is the final momentum. Note: one must be careful when calculating \\(\\varDelta p\\) since change in momentum involves subracting one vector from another vector.   Impulse As shown above, when a resultant force \\(\\sum F\\) acts on an object for a time \\(\\triangle t\\) the object experiences a change in momentum. The product of this resultant force and time is called the impulse I of the force.  \\[\\begin{align*} I &amp; =\\sum F\\times\\triangle t\\\\ &amp; =\\triangle p\\\\ &amp; =mv_{f}-mv_{i} \\end{align*}\\] the unit of impulse is \\(Ns\\).  It can be shown that since change in momentum is equal to impulse , then \\(kgms\\) \\(^{-1}\\) (kilogram meter per second) is equivalent to \\(Ns\\) (Newton second).  Note  As momentum and impulse are vectors , a sign convention in problems on momentum and impulse is essential. A negative sign for the change in momentum indicates a loss of momentum; a positive sign indicates a gain in momentum. Make sure you can do vector subtraction calculations. Remember that \\(\\sum F\\) is the resultant force.    Impulse is given by the area under an \\(F-\\triangle t\\) graph The area under a force - time graph gives the impulse of a force. This is very useful when the force is non-uniform (see below)  \\(I=\\sum F\\times\\triangle t\\) is central to much of modern car design. For instance, if a test car travelling at \\(60km\/h\\) crashes into a wall or a large balloon (!) the change in momentum \\(\\triangle p\\) for both will be the same. Why is it so? Hitting a wall means the force is large and time to stop is short however hitting a balloon the force is lower and the time to stop is greater, remember the final velocity is \\(0\\) in both cases and the mass of the car does not change. Since \\(\\sum F\\times\\triangle t=m\\times\\triangle v\\) then \\(\\sum F\\times\\triangle t=k\\) (constant) Hence \\(F\\alpha\\frac{1}{\\triangle t}\\)  For the wall crash: \\(\\triangle t\\) is small. therefore F is large , ie, a larger force is acting for a smaller time. For the wall crash: \\(\\triangle t\\) is large. therefore F is small , ie, a smaller force is acting for a larger time.    Conservation of Momentum When two balls A and B collide, the action of A on B is equal and opposite to that of B on A. (Newtons 3\\(^{rd}\\) Law)  Hence the rate of change of momentum of A is equal and opposite to the rate of change of momentum of B. Since the time of contact is the same for both, then the change in momentum of A is equal and opposite to the change in momentum of B. That is, the total momentum before impact equals the total momentum after impact.  \\[\\begin{align*} Total\\ momentum\\ before\\ collision &amp; =Total\\ momentum\\ after\\ collision\\\\ \\sum p_{i} &amp; =\\sum p_{f} \\end{align*}\\]  Note: This is known as the law of conservation of momentum. The total momentum is the same before , during and after impact, or  \\[\\begin{align*} m_{A}u_{A}+m_{B}u_{B} &amp; =m_{A}v_{A}+m_{B}v_{B} \\end{align*}\\]  where \\(m\\) \\(_{A}=\\) mass of A, \\(m\\) \\(_{B}\\)= mass of B, \\(u\\) \\(_{A}\\) = velocity of A before impact, \\(u\\) \\(_{B}\\)= velocity of B before impact, \\(v\\) \\(_{A}=\\) velocity of A after impact, \\(v\\) \\(_{B}=\\) velocity of B after impact.   Note  Always draw a diagram when doing momentum problems. A sign convention (+, ) is essential (momentum and impulse are vectors). Be careful with negative and positive signs! If, for instance, the two cars collide and stay together after the collision, then the momentum of the two cars before the collision is equal to the momentum of the lockedtogether cars after the collision. Mathematically, problems on collisions or explosions are similar, except that for an explosion, the momentum of the system before the blast is often zero. In closed systems no external forces act. For example, a spacecraft colliding in deep space experiences no external force because there is no gravitational field. Systems close to the Earths surface are systems that are not closed because the external force acting is the Earths gravitational force. To make them closed one has to include the Earth as part of the system.    Momentum transfer involving the Earth The following two situations describe how momentum is transferred to the Earth.  A ball is thrown up: it rises against gravity and then slows down and stops, losing momentum due to the earth. The ball starts to fall under the influence of gravity, speeding up thereby giving the earth an equal and opposite momentum change. The falling ball hits the ground. The momentum is not lost. It is transferred to the earth. A bicycle on the flat is slowed down due to friction. The loss of momentum of the bike is transferred to the earth which gains an equal and opposite momentum.

Describing these motions require some technical terms such as displacement, distance, velocity, speed and acceleration. The terms and their relationships to one another are described in this module.  Scalar and Vector Quantities Quantities that have only a magnitude and no specified direction are called scalar quantities. Examples are time, speed and distance. Quantities that have both magnitude and direction are called vector quantities. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. We discuss these below.  Displacement \\(\\left(x\\right)\\) When an object is moved from one point to another it is said to be displaced. If we move to Dandenong we can say we have been displaced \\(32\\,km\\) from Melbourne, but to define our position, we need to specify a direction and say we are \\(32\\,km\\) South East of Melbourne. That is we give a magnitude (\\(32\\,km\\)) and a direction (South East). Consequently displacement is a vector quantity. Note that displacement is often referred to as position.   Distance \\(\\left(d\\right)\\) Distance is the magnitude (size) of the displacement, but has no direction so it is a scalar quantity. For example you can say my distance is \\(60\\,km\\) away, but your displacement is \\(60\\,km\\) in a direction - such as \\(60\\,km\\) West.   Velocity \\(\\left(v\\right)\\) Velocity \\(v\\) is the rate of change of displacement \\(x\\). That is, for an object moving at constant velocity, \\[\\begin{align*} v &amp; =\\frac{x}{t} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is the time taken. Since displacement is a vector quantity, so is velocity. The units of velocity depend on the units of displacement and time. If displacement is in metres \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) and time is in seconds \\(\\left(s\\right)\\) the unit of velocity is metres per second and is written as \\(m\/s\\) or \\(ms^{-1}.\\) 1 Note that \\(m\/s\\) is metres divided by seconds. The notation \\(ms^{-1}\\) uses indicial notation. Here \\(s^{-1}=1\/s\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} ms^{-1} &amp; =m\\times s^{-1}\\\\ &amp; =m\\times\\frac{1}{s}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{s}. \\end{align*}\\]   Speed The speed of an object is the magnitude (size) of it\u2019s velocity. It has no direction and so is a scalar quantity.   Acceleration \\(\\left(a\\right)\\) Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. That is \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{v}{t}. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(v\\) is in metres per second, the unit of acceleration is metres per second per second2 The notation \\(ms^{-2}\\) uses indicial notation. Here \\(s^{-2}=1\/s^{2}\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} ms^{-2} &amp; =m\\times s^{-2}\\\\ &amp; =m\\times\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{s^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =m\/s^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] and is written as \\(m\/s^{2}\\) or \\(ms^{-2}.\\) Since velocity is a vector quantity, so too is acceleration.    Distance vs Time Graphs Let\u2019s suppose a person, starting from rest, runs a distance \\(\\left(d\\right)\\) of \\(12\\,m\\) in a time \\(\\left(t\\right)\\) of \\(2\\,s.\\) We could graph this as:3 Here we are assuming that the speed is constant.  Note that the gradient of a distance (a scalar quantity) versus time graph gives the speed (also a scalar quantity). In this case, the speed is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{speed} &amp; =\\frac{d}{t}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{12}{2}\\\\ &amp; =6\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\]   Displacement vs Time Graphs Consider the graph below:  Note that this is displacement (a vector quantity) versus time. Whereas the gradient of the distance versus time graph gave speed, the gradient of the displacement (a vector) versus time graph gives velocity (a vector). Looking at the graph, from A to B the object is moving at a constant velocity (because the graph is a straight line). Its velocity \\(v\\) is the gradient of the line from A to B. That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{B$-displacement\\;at\\;A$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{B$-time\\;at\\;\\text{A}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-0}{2-0}\\\\ &amp; =4\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\] Now consider what happens from B to C. There is no change in displacement and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{C$-displacement\\;at\\;B$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{C$-time\\;at\\;\\text{B}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-8}{3-2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{1}\\,m\/s\\\\ &amp; =0\\,m\/s \\end{align*}\\] That is, the object has a velocity of \\(0\\,m\/s\\) between B and C. Now consider what happens from C to D. The displacement decreases from \\(8\\) to \\(0\\) over a time of \\(1\\,s.\\) So the velocity is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{D$-displacement\\;at\\;C$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{D$-time\\;at\\;\\text{C}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-8}{4-3}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{8}{1}\\\\ &amp; =-8\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\] This means the object has reversed (due to the negative sign) its direction and is moving at a SPEED of \\(8\\,m\/s.\\) At D, the object has returned to its starting position.   Velocity vs Time Graphs The velocity-time graph below shows a car which accelerates uniformly from rest to \\(60\\,m\/s\\) in \\(20\\,s,\\)then travels at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) for the next \\(10\\,s\\), then decelerates uniformly to rest in \\(30\\,s.\\) The total journey took \\(60\\,s.\\)  From \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the object accelerates from \\(0\\,m\/s\\) to \\(60\\,m\/s\\). From \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the object is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) and from \\(C\\) to \\(D,\\)the object is slowing down from \\(60\\,m\/s.\\) We now look at some features of the graph in detail. In particular we look at the area under the graph and it\u2019s gradient.  Area Under Velocity Time Graph Consider the units of the area. The area is the product of the velocity and time and so the units are \\(m\/s\\,\\times s=m.\\) That is, the area under the graph gives displacement.   The area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement. The area under a speed-time graph gives distance.   Consider the velocity time graph above. The area has been divided into three regions, \\(1,2\\) and \\(3.\\) Let area of each region be \\(A_{1},A_{2}\\) and \\(A_{3},\\)respectively. We have:4 Remember that the area of a triangle \\(A_{t}\\) is half \\(\\times\\)base \\(\\times\\) height and the area of a rectangle \\(A_{r}\\) is base \\(\\times\\) height. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} A_{t} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}bh\\\\ A_{r} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =bh. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} A_{1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times20\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{2} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =10\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{3} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times30\\times60\\\\ &amp; =900\\,m. \\end{align*}\\] The total displacement is therefore \\(A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}=600+600+900=2100\\,m.\\)   Gradient of a Velocity-Time Graph The gradient (or slope)5 The gradient \\(m,\\) of a linear (straight line) graph is the rise divided by the run. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}. \\end{align*}\\] of a Velocity-Time graph gives the acceleration of the object. Consider the velocity-time graph above. From \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) the gradient of the graph is \\(m_{AB}\\) where \\[\\begin{align*} m_{AB} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-0}{20-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60}{20}\\\\ &amp; =3\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the car is increasing its speed by \\(3\\,m\/s\\) each second. From \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{BC} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-60}{30-20}=\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{10}\\\\ &amp; =0\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is the car is not accelerating but is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s.\\) From \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{CD} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-60}{60-30}=\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{60}{30}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the negative value of acceleration indicates the car is slowing down. We say the car is decelerating.   Further examples 1. A car accelerates from a stationary position. The rate of acceleration is constant6 If acceleration is constant we also use the expression \u201cthe acceleration is uniform\u201d. . Sketch graphs of the acceleration against time, the velocity against time and the displacement against time. Solution: The acceleration-time graph is shown below.   It is simply a horizontal line as the acceleration is constant. The velocity-time graph is shown below.  It is a linear graph. The gradient (slope) of the graph is the acceleration. The displacement-time graph is shown below.  This is a curve. The gradient (slope) at any point on the curve is the velocity at that time. You can find the approximate value of the gradient by drawing a tangent at the point of interest and then calculating the gradient of the tangent.7 If you know the functional form of the displacement, then you can differentiate it to find the gradient at any time. For example, if \\[\\begin{align*} x\\left(t\\right) &amp; =3t^{2}-2t+1 \\end{align*}\\] then the gradient is \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =6t-2. \\end{align*}\\] 2. A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\). Sketch and describe the graph of velocity of the ball against time from the moment it is thrown to the moment it touches the ground. Ignore air resistance. Solution: First define the coordinate system you want to work in. We take upwards velocity as positive and downwards velocity as negative. Once the ball is thrown up, the only force acting on it is gravity which is constant. So from the previous example, the graph of velocity against time is linear. That is, a straight line. As gravity acts downwards, the velocity against time graph must have a negative gradient (because the ball is decelerating). So a velocity-time graph looks like the one below.  Now we need to describe it. Think about what has happened. Initially the ball is thrown into the air vertically upwards (positive direction) with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\).

A vector has both a size (called its magnitude) and a direction. This module explains how vectors may be added together.  Scalars and Vectors Many physical quantities can be classified into one of two groups: scalars or vectors. Scalar quantities are completely defined by a magnitude and the relevant unit. For example, a time period may be expressed as 10 seconds. The magnitude is 10, the unit is seconds and there is no direction associated with a time period, so time is a scalar quantity. Vector quantities require magnitude and direction and the relevant unit. For example, suppose I walk in a Northerly direction for 200 metres. The magnitude is 200, the direction is North and the unit is metres. So my walk is a vector quantity.   Examples Some examples of vector and scalar quantities are shown below:          Physical Quantity Scalar Vector Example of Unit     time \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\times\\) seconds, hours, days, etc.   distance \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\times\\) centimeters, metres, kilometres etc.   displacement \\(\\times\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 100 metres North, 50 metres in the \\(x\\)-direction   temperature \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\times\\) \\(45^{\\circ}\\) Celsius   speed \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\times\\) 100 kilometres per hour, 3 metres per second   velocity \\(\\times\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 100 kilometres per hour, South; 3 \\(ms^{-1}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis   voltage \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\times\\) 250 millivolts DC      Representing Vector Quantities Vectors are drawn by an arrow, whose length varies with the magnitude of the vector (drawn to scale!) and which points in the appropriate direction. For example, suppose North is up the page, South is down, East is to the right and West is to the left. \\(A\\) vector from a point \\(A\\) to a point \\(B\\) (East of \\(A\\)) representing a distance of 10 metres could be shown as in the diagram below1 We call \\(A\\) the tail of the vector and \\(B\\) the head of the vector., East is assumed to be positive so the arrow points towards \\(B\\).  Using the same scale, a vector representing a distance of 2 metres to the west of A could be represented by:  The beginning and end of a vector may be identified by letters such as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as above. In such cases the vector may be referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\). The arrow above the letters signifies that the quantity \\(AB\\) is a vector but does not point in the direction of the vector. If we wanted a vector of magnitude 10 meters pointing West it would look like:  This vector is referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}.\\) Note that \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}=-\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}. \\] In other words, multiplying a vector by \\(-1\\) changes the direction of the vector.   Magnitude of a Vector Sometimes we want to use only the magnitude (size) of a particular vector. In such cases, to distinguish that it is only the magnitude that is being used, we use the modulus sign \\(\\left|\\right|\\). So for the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\) above we would have \\[ \\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|=10\\textrm{ metres} \\] as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,}\\) represented a distance of 10 metres to the East.  Examples  The magnitude of a vector representing a velocity of 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\)in a southerly direction is 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\). The magnitude of a force of 18 Newtons in a Westerly direction is 18 Newtons.     Adding Vectors Two vectors are added by placing the tail of the second vector at the head off the first and drawing an arrow from the tail of the first to the head of the second. For example we will add a vector that is 2 metres to the east to another vector that is 5 metres to the east. The two vectors to be added together are shown in red and the resulting vector is shown in blue.  We can write this algebraically as: \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}. \\] The vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}\\) is called the resultant and in this case is a vector of magnitude 7 metres in an Easterly direction. We can also add vectors that are in North and South directions. For example if we add a vector representing 2 metres South to a vector representing 4 meters North we get:  Notice that the vector to the South is shown pointing downwards as we assume North is up. The result is a vector (shown in red) of length 2 meters pointing North. We could write this as \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,} \\] as before. Now add a vector of 3 meters to the North to another of 4 meters to the East:  The resultant vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\) is shown in red. It\u2019s magnitude may be found using Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem:2 Note that the angle \\(\\widehat{BCD}\\) or \\(\\widehat{BAD}\\) is 90 degrees and so Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem can be used.  \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{\\left|\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}+\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{9+16}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{25}\\\\ &amp; =5. \\end{align*}\\] The direction my be found by calculating the angle \\(\\widehat{CBD}\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\widehat{CBD} &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =53.13^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] So the resultant vector has a magnitude of 5 metres in a direction North \\(53.13\\) degrees East.   Exercises  1.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km East\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km West. 2.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{40\\,\\,}\\)km North\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km South. 3.

Two forces \\(\\overrightarrow{100\\,\\,}\\) Newtons North and \\(\\overrightarrow{100\\,\\,}\\) Newtons East are acting away from the same point. Find their vector sum (also called the resultant force). 5. A plane is flying due North at 300 km\/h and a Westerly wind of 25 km\/h is blowing it off course.

Knowing the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, the length of the third side can be calculated. This mathematical formula is fundamental for finding lengths and distances that are difficult to physically measure.       Right Angled Triangles Triangles are plane shapes with three straight sides. A right angled triangle contains an angle of \\(90^{\\circ}\\) as shown below.1 A right angle is an angle of \\(90^{\\circ}\\).  In a right angled triangle, the longest side is opposite the right angle and is called the hypotenuse.   Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem The theorem states that, in a right angled triangle,2 Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem does not apply to any triangle - only right angled triangles.  the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In symbols:  \\[ h^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}. \\] Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem my be used to find the length of the third side of a triangle if you know the length of the other two sides.  Example 1 Find the length of the hypotenuse in the triangle below:  Solution: Using Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem we have: \\[\\begin{align*} h^{2} &amp; =a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =6^{2}+8^{2}\\\\ &amp; =36+64\\\\ &amp; =100. \\end{align*}\\] So the hypotenuse \\[\\begin{align*} h &amp; =\\sqrt{100}\\\\ &amp; =10\\,. \\end{align*}\\] The length of the hypotenuse is \\(10\\,cm.\\)3 Don\u2019t forget to include the unit of measurement in your answer.

Using Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 20^{2} &amp; =15^{2}+x^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging to make \\(x^{2}\\) the subject we have: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2} &amp; =20^{2}-15^{2}\\\\ &amp; =400-225\\\\ &amp; =175.\\\\ \\textrm{Taking the square root of both sides gives:$\\quad$ }\\\\ x &amp; =\\sqrt{175}\\\\ &amp; =13.23\\,. \\end{align*}\\] The length of the side \\(x\\) is \\(13.23\\,m\\).   Example 3 Find the length of the unknown side in the triangle below to two decimal places:  Solution: In this case the hypotenuse \\(h=12.5\\,cm\\) and one of the shorter sides is \\(10.7\\:cm\\). Let the unknown side have length \\(x\\) then using Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem: \\[\\begin{align*} 12.5^{2} &amp; =10.7^{2}+x^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging to make \\(x^{2}\\) the subject we have: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2} &amp; =12.5^{2}-10.7^{2}\\\\ &amp; =156.25-114.49\\\\ &amp; =41.76\\,.\\\\ \\textrm{Taking the square root of both sides gives:$\\quad$ }\\\\ x &amp; =\\sqrt{41.76}\\\\ &amp; =6.46\\,. \\end{align*}\\] The length of the side is \\(6.46\\,cm.\\)    Pythagorean Triples In some right angled triangles, the length of all three sides is an integer.4 The integers is the set of whole numbers and is denoted by \\[ \\mathbb{Z}=\\left\\{ \\cdots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\cdots\\right\\} . \\] In this case the three side lengths are called a Pythagorean Triple.

The sine rule shows that the ratio of the length of a side, to the sine of its opposite angle, will be the same for all three sides.  The Sine rule can be used to find angles and sides in any triangle (not just a right-angled triangle) when given:  One side and any two angles or Two sides and an angle opposite one of the given sides.   The Sine Rule In the triangle \\(ABC\\) below:  angles \\(A,B,C\\), are the angles at the vertices \\(A,B,C\\) respectively \\(a,b,c\\) are the side lengths opposite the angles \\(A,B,C\\) respectively.

Solution: In this case there are two possible solutions as shown below.   This is called the ambiguous case of the sine rule. To solve the problem, use the sine rule in the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sin A}{a} &amp; =\\frac{\\sin C}{c}\\\\ \\frac{\\sin30^{\\circ}}{8} &amp; =\\frac{\\sin C}{12}\\\\ \\frac{\\sin30^{\\circ}}{8}\\times12 &amp; =\\sin C\\\\ \\sin C &amp; =\\frac{1}{16}\\times12\\\\ &amp; =0.75\\\\ C &amp; =\\sin^{-1}\\left(0.75\\right)\\\\ &amp; =48.6^{\\circ}\\textrm{or }131.4^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(C=48.6^{\\circ},\\) this solution gives the triangle \\(ABC_{2}.\\) If \\(C=131.4^{\\circ}=\\left(180^{\\circ}-48.6^{\\circ}\\right)\\), this solution gives the triangle \\(ABC_{1}.\\)   Note: In any non-right-angled triangle, where two sides and the non-included angle are given, check for the ambiguous case. If the angle is acute and the length of the side adjacent to the angle is greater than the length of the side opposite the angle there may be 2 possible solutions.

These activity models are ideas that teachers can adapt to use in their own teaching in most vocational fields. As authors of this professional development kit, we believe that learning happens most effectively: when learners are engaged in mutual dialogue and activity, accompanied by input of new ideas; when they are given opportunities to relate new content to existing knowledge and experience and when they are encouraged to reflect on its possible application to their own situation. Using the publication for interactive professional development This publication is therefore designed primarily to be used in interactive professional development situations, with a facilitator and any group of participating vocational teachers. It contains suggested activities that can be used to facilitate discussion and reflection and gradual content input. The activities come with prepared overhead master copies and are supplemented by reading material for both facilitators and participants. Further details are outlined below. Using the publication as reading for awareness If the interactive professional development is not possible then the handouts and background readings can be read as stand-alone documents. These will raise awareness of LLN issues within the VET sector and provide suggested strategies to overcome them. Facilitators For the most effective Professional Development sessions it is preferable that the facilitator of the activities within this kit has a background in language, literacy and VET, or cooperates with a colleague who has this background knowledge. Structure of the publication The Sections The publication is divided into sections as follows: Section 1: LLN Awareness &ndash; Explores the meaning and scope of LLN (language, literacy and numeracy) and associated issues. Section 2: Promoting better learning: Dealing with students' learning barriers &ndash; Investigates the literacy modes used in teaching and learning, some of the common learning barriers related to the memory, attention span and learning styles and integrated LLN strategies to overcome the barriers. Activities in this section demonstrate the suggested strategies as well as providing opportunities for reflection on their application in participants' classes. Section 3: Integrated LLN activities for VET teaching &ndash; Contains demonstration versions of &nbsp;four 'activity models' which can be adapted to integrate language into a wide variety of VET programs. The activities of this section are designed to be combined with those of other sections within professional development workshops. Section 4: Assessment issues relating to LLN in VET &ndash; Looks at pre-course assessment of LLN as well as LLN related issues in ongoing assessment practices. As with section 3, Activities within the section demonstrate assessment techniques as well as facilitating reflection and discussion about their effects and potential applications. Section 5: Models of integration for LLN in VET &ndash; Looks at possible strategies for supporting students with LLN during their VET program and facilitations discussion of adaptation to participants' environments. Content of the Sections Each of the sections contains: Topic readings &ndash; Brief overviews of the topics serve as background reading for the facilitator to assist in preparing and presenting sessions. These may also be distributed to practitioners to reinforce the professional development sessions, and in some cases they are recommended reading material to be used during the PD sessions. Facilitator Introduction to the Section &ndash; These provide an overview of the purpose of the section as well as general advice or tips related to the activities within it. Facilitator Activity Descriptions - These are suggested step by step guidelines for facilitating each of the activities. They include preparation advice and suggested questions and prompts for starting discussions. Of course, we assume that experienced presenters will adapt these to fit their own needs and preferences. Overhead Transparency Masters &ndash; of stimulus materials, discussion questions, teacher quotes, summaries and snippets from readings. These can be photocopied to create overhead transparencies or copied as PowerPoint displays for use during the PD activities.

Language and literacy are often used interchangeably but they are not really the same. Language Language is the broader term as it encompasses all the modes and skills involved in speaking, listening, reading and writing. Language involves words, phrases and sentences, the grammatical structures, whether spoken or written, including the use of idioms, slang or jargon. Language is the primary way we communicate with each other. For the Australian deaf community it is the visual language of AUSLAN, for the blind community it includes the use of Braille. Indeed every profession, trade, industry, community or social group has their own particular language in terms of not only the words and phrases that they use but also the ways those groups and individuals communicate with each other. Whether a group or individual uses a lot of slang or has a teasing, joking culture or relies on more polite and formal communications is all part of a particular language culture. All languages in use across the globe are dynamic as they are constantly changing, developing and evolving. In our desire to communicate effectively we are all constantly and often unconsciously learning new words and ways of communicating with different groups of people throughout our lives.    Language and literacy are constantly changing   Literacy It is generally accepted that literacy is language in use. It is about reading and writing as well as the skills of speaking and listening including awareness of the types of tone and connotations associated with communicating in different work, social or cultural contexts. Like language, literacy is constantly changing over time as we develop new ways to communicate and debate or explain information. The 'new' literacies involved in technological communications whether by email or text messages mentioned above or the skills involved in accessing, applying and using information or services offered on the internet highlight the changing nature of the literacy skills we need to operate in a technological world. We all need to be extending and developing our literacy skills as in order to adapt to new situations in a rapidly changing world.  New technologies, new literacies   The meaning and scope of the term 'Numeracy' 'Numeracy' refers to the application of mathematical skills in real situations related to a person's life, work and participation in their community. It involves interpreting mathematically related concepts and language, such as the graphs used in newspapers, or on TV during an election broadcast. It also includes the ability to keep up with new demands in the workplace. For example, the skills involved with calculating GST in the trades and in business rely on understanding the meaning of '%' and the ability to calculate a simple percentage in the head. According to Australian research this is beyond over 50% of our adult population.  Numeracy also incorporates spatial skills, including reading and interpreting two dimensional plans and relating them to the three dimensional reality. It includes reading street directories and grid references; weighing and measuring; interpreting tables and standards; calculating and interpreting rates; recording data; calculating in the head; using calculators or other computational technologies. Numeracy includes the ability to make reasonable estimations and a feeling for 'way out' results when measuring or calculating. It also incorporates using formulae (particularly those related to your workplace) and in some cases even the ability to transpose formulae. Confidence and 'ownership' of the mathematical skills are an important part of being numerate. This is one respect in which school mathematics education has let down many potential VET learners.  'Ownership' of mathematical skills is an important part of being numerate! Language, literacy and numeracy in VET Whether we are aware of it or not, LLN skills development is important for all study, formal and informal, at all levels including traineeships and apprenticeships, certificate and diploma programs, degree and post graduate programs. How teachers and their students develop these skills is an important factor in determining the quality of any vocational program. LLN in VET teaching? We all need LLN skills development Continual development of language, literacy and numeracy skills is vital for everybody not just for those of us who are perceived to have poor skills. New knowledge needed for work is growing exponentially. This means we all have to keep developing our LLN skills to adapt or even survive in that ever-changing world of work. For example we have had to apply and develop our new technology literacy skills in order to keep up with new ways of studying and working. We have to learn to use the internet and scan computer screens quickly to find information, to use phones and internet for banking, purchasing and making bookings. We are having to learn to send and interpret text messages and emails with their particular shortened means of expression and symbols. For example, the sign off 'Cya' is one I've encountered recently and the symbol :) has become a common means of expressing feeling. New terms continually creep into our language without us consciously realising it. At the time of writing this, it is appropriate to ask: 'Who doesn't know the most recent meanings of 24\/7 or 9\/11?' Imagine what meaning would be lost from TV and news talk if these terms remained a mystery to you.  New terms creep into our language Numeracy: the N in LLN Numeracy is often forgotten when discussing LLN policy and practices; perhaps because it covers such a range of meaning and an accompanying minefield of difficulties. Numeracy refers to the confident application of your mathematical skills in real situations related to your life, work and community and also making sense of the results you get. It requires more than the ability to do the repetitious exercises often associated with school mathematics.  Numeracy is everywhere!  Numeracy is embedded in our language and culture We are not always aware of how many numeracy concepts are embedded in our everyday language. For instance, consider the term used above, 'growing exponentially'. Without some numeracy understanding (in this case the visual image of a rapidly rising curve) the term is meaningless. Even watching an election coverage on the television requires us to engage more and more with graph related visual images and to understand their meaning. These are all part of the changing numeracy demands for participation in our society. Numeracy demands of work The need to use statistical control charts has swept through the manufacturing sectors along with the globalization push for 'quality' registration. Suddenly workers on the factory floor have had to develop new 'numeracies' and associated literacies. Similarly the coming of GST has created a whole set of numeracy skill demands for trades people. Transfer of school maths is not automatic Just as literacy needs are constantly changing and developing so are numeracy needs. Every field, trade or profession has its own changing numeracy requirements which need specific attention in their training program. It is not enough to assume transfer of school mathematics skills because many workers have very few skills and very little confidence to use what they do have. Even if the skills and formulae have been learned successfully in the early years of school, they may be used differently in the vocational area. For example, a maths support teacher described how confusing it was for plumbing apprentices to calculate trench and pipe volumes using the standard school formula V = A x h (Volume = base area by height) because the pipes were usually on their side not standing, and they needed the pipe length rather than height.  LLN needs explicit teaching! Language, literacy and numeracy need explicit teaching When teaching any vocational course it is important to be aware of the new language, signs and symbols (the literacies) and numeracies that are taken for granted within the profession or trade. These will be new to the learners and so they need to be deliberately introduced and 'taught' along with the new skills and knowledge. It is surprising in fact, how much of the 'knowledge' of the vocation is interwoven with its language and how much clearer a subject can be for learners when the language and symbols are explicitly addressed in class. The activities demonstrated as part of this professional development publication will also help students develop lifelong learning strategies related to speaking, reading and study skills that will better equip them for future learning, either in educational settings or workplaces.

Whether consciously or not, we tend to study and imitate those who already belong to the club &ndash; whether it's a banner carrying activist; a leather clad bikey or a cyclist in lycra; we try to behave the way they do, dress the way they do, acquire the right accessories, learn the accepted language and, above all, act as if it all comes naturally. Take on an identity In short, when we want to 'belong' to a group we try very hard to learn how to belong, that is how to fit in and be accepted by the existing members of the group. Some people refer to this as trying to 'take on an identity'. If young students are surrounded by friends and fellow students who seem at home 'texting' one another, then they are probably going to try and become one of them and take on a 'texter' identity. They are likely to purchase the phone, whatever seems the most popular at the time (not the one their parents think they should have because its cheaper) and quickly focus on learning to use it as their friends do: learning to 'talk the talk' of the texters. Similar learning takes place for those who want to enter the more specialist worlds of 'Pokemon' or 'Dungeons and Dragons'.  Wanting to belong motivates you to learn! Clubs &ndash; identity &ndash; language Think of a sport or hobby that you are into. Think of the rules and behaviours, both official and unofficial, that make up its special culture and how you learned them. In other words, how you took on the identity of a player or became a member of that group. For example, if you were to take up golf, there is an enormous number of rules to learn as well as acceptable behaviours &ndash; where to leave your buggy when playing a shot so you don't get in the way of other people, when an where you can speak on the course, and how loudly is acceptable. There is also an enormous amount of special knowledge and language that golfers need to know. How do you learn all of this and why? You may have acquired it easily as you grew up in a golfing family, or like me, you may have to learn it later because you want to play the sport. It is wanting to play the sport that makes you put the effort into learning. And your new learning will be added to a whole collection of existing knowledge and languages (literacies) that you already bring to the golf lessons.  Learn how to 'talk the talk' Different groups, different identities, different literacies We have all probably taken on a number of different identities or learned to fit into a number of different groups in our lives: families, local cultures, political groups, hobby or sporting groups and the professional worlds in which we work. Sometimes, as we move from one group to another, we have to switch identities. We have to behave differently, wear different clothes and even use different language in order to fit in. The combination of knowledge, behaviours and language (the literacies) that we have acquired in the course of becoming part of these groups or taking on these identities, forms the unique person that each of us is now.   How does this relate to VET teaching? There are two aspects that are useful to consider from this discussion. First, that learning within a VET program can be seen as taking on a new professional 'identity' in order to be accepted in the workplace, and along with it the specialist language and literacy that is part of that identity. Secondly, that it is good for us as VET teachers to remember that both teachers and students bring different identities, expertise and 'literacies' to any learning situation. It is probably a good idea to acknowledge this and to open up the possibility that the teacher and students can learn different things from one another as they go about the task of learning the specialist language of the vocational field.  Specialist language in VET Every profession, trade or vocational area has its own specialist language and literacy. This includes particular terminology: special words, phrases, acronyms and even slang terms that make up the everyday talk of people in the field. Some people call it 'jargon', often in a derogatory tone which implies that it shouldn't be used. However, the reality is that every profession and trade does use its own unique language. Literacy people tend to refer to the 'discourse or specialist 'register' of the field (vocational area). Some also refer to 'multiliteracies' to highlight the range of 'literacies' needed for different occupations or pursuits. Part of introducing students to the new field is helping them to become literate in its specialist language. That means helping them to learn the meanings of new terms as well as they way in which they are commonly used when writing and speaking within the trade or profession. Borrowed language &ndash; new meanings for old words Often specialist language contains lots of terms from everyday English which are given entirely different meanings in the new language. For example, think about the first thing that comes to mind when you see the word 'cookie' (apart from the fact that this is another US addition to the universal English language). Then consider alternative meanings that it has in different professions. Whilst 'a baker bakes cookies' an IT technician could stop a cookie from being transmitted over the internet, and a photographer uses a cookie as an attachment on a light stand (ANTA 2002). If you think further into slang or colloquial expressions then you might also be familiar with the idea of a person who 'has his hands in the cookie jar' meaning that he is stealing from his organisation or team.  'Cookie' - One word many meanings Try your own instinctive reaction to these examples: volume, surfing, power. Then compare your initial thoughts to the comments below.  Volume: Whilst most people will relate to the sound switch on the TV, radio or CD player, and librarians might instantly conjure up part of a series of books, mathematics teachers always seem to assume that students instantly make the mental shift to their world in which volume is automatically the amount that a container can hold . Surfing: Your instinctive reaction to this term depends on the era you grew up in. To my mother 'surf' was a brand of soap powder. A few years ago 'surfing' would instantly conjure up images of a sport, (a fairly male dominated one) involving boards, wetsuits, vans, and a mysterious language of its own (with words like 'bombora' and 'pipeline', waves that were 'hairy' (which was good) or 'dumpers' (which were bad) and vehicles which were ____________ wagons. These days many more people of all ages are 'surfing' the web, a phrase that was meaningless to most of us a mere decade ago. Power: Again it has many meaning according to your vocational field. In maths it is another word for an index as in '2 to the power 3 equals 8'. In science, engineering or mechanics it relates to energy generation, in sociology or politics it is about our ability to influence or control others. As well economists talk of 'purchasing power'.  Specialist meanings in different contexts Consider the amount of borrowed language in this excerpt from a student's learning resource.  'a hard soldered type elbow or tee with an external nipple is silver brazed to the copper tube to provide a threaded water connection point' Although a plumber might not give this sentence a second thought, others outside the trade (not members of the club) see a sentence loaded with familiar English language words which obviously must have specialist meanings in the particular context. In this case we outsiders can probably guess the meanings, or at least some approximation, because we can assume visual similarities, but we still need to read it several times and certainly could not guarantee any confident understanding. These kinds of words and phrases often act as barriers to learning for students. New terms that they don't understand can discourage learners from non English speaking backgrounds but also native English speakers who lack confidence in their ability (perhaps because of poor experiences in the school system). Specialist language that is not introduced gradually and given some focus within their regular learning (class teaching or written materials) can prevent them from understanding or even feeling a sense of belonging to their chosen vocational area.

They can also be extended to three sets of cards, for instance pictures of tools, names of the tools, matched with what they would be used for.

Benefits of matching activities Matching activities are non-threatening because all of the 'answers' are there and difficult items can be worked out by a process of elimination. They boost student confidence because they acknowledge their existing knowledge rather than having the teacher as the only expert. Matching activities encourage students to share their different areas of expertise. Establishing a cooperative approach through structured activities like this tends to have flow on benefits as students will then help each other in other aspects of their theory and practical work. They allow the teacher to observe student learning\/understanding. By listening to a group discussion they can pick up on students' areas of strength and weakness. They provide opportunities for students to give feedback about their thinking to the teacher as they discuss the reasons for their choices.

Students are asked to read a collection of statements and together consider whether they think it is likely to be:  always true sometimes true always false.  For statements that they consider are 'sometimes true' they are asked to decide when they are true and when not, and be prepared to explain this to the rest of the class.

Benefits of true and false discussion activities They boost student confidence because they acknowledge their existing knowledge prior to presenting more challenging statements. They encourage students to verbalise their thinking as they present their arguments to each other and to the class as a whole They provide students with an opportunity to think about a topic prior to the teachers' input. Once students have thought about their own understanding of an idea they are more likely to be receptive to teacher input. They provide opportunities to probe more deeply into ambiguities and finer points of meaning than could be done with individuals working alone. They encourage students to share their different understandings of the topic. Establishing a cooperative approach through structured activities like this tends to have flow on benefits as students will then help each other in other aspects of their theory and practical work. They allow the teacher to observe student learning\/understanding. By listening to a group discussion they can pick up on students' areas of strength and gain feedback about any misunderstandings.  Creating a true or false discussion activity The set of statements can be anything from two to ten, depending on the time available for debriefing and the purpose for which you are using the activity (for example, revision vs. introduction of a new aspect of the topic). It is most effective to have one or two easy statements to begin the exercise in order to boost students' confidence prior to more challenging questions. It is useful to create one or more statements around aspects of a topic that students of the past have commonly misunderstood, or perhaps ignored. By introducing the common mistake in a group exercise it is removed from being an individual error and hopefully prevent students making the same mistake in the future. It can also capture students' attention more as they will have a vested interest in the 'correct' response after the small group or pair discussion. Framing statements around ambiguous areas of the subject matter can promote debate and discussion which aid deeper learning.           Set of statements not questions   Use topic that students have misunderstood in the past   Promotes debate &amp; discussion      Remember that each item should be written as a statement, rather than in questions format.

Every vocational course is different in terms of the level and kind of LLN required at entry as well as during the program. For example, some VET courses require an understanding of higher level Maths and so a numeracy test which assessed only competency in the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division would obviously be inappropriate. Similarly some VET courses are more language intensive than others. For example competencies in Business Law in the Financial Services training package require students to learn new and difficult legal terminology and to analyse and argue a response to a legal case study require higher level language and literacy skills than perhaps students embarking on a retail traineeship. By the same token it would be pointless give a complex reading task say using an Age feature article to students embarking on a trade apprenticeship. These students will need to understand and learn a whole lot of new trade language and quite technical procedures but they won't need to critically analyse a writer's arguments.  Make the test fit the competencies of the course Pre-entry assessments need to be customised An important principle for any LLN assessment in VET is that it is customised for the competencies required for any particular VET program and it may be helpful to seek the assistances of LLN specialist in your institute. You will see the texts and tasks included in the test are related to the course of study but do not require specific prior knowledge. You may also see that the skills assessed are all skills that will be needed by students in order to undertake the course. Necessary LLN skills include, the ability to:  read documents relevant to the subject matter of the course of study interpret graphs and charts that relate to the course content, perform simple but related calculations and measurements in course related contexts write sufficiently to undertake the tasks of the profession.  Those skills chosen to include in the assessment are those which the teacher knows, from her experience, can prove difficult to the students. The aim of the test is to gain a broad picture of the number of students who may need support and in what areas. From that information, planning decisions can be made about the appropriate methods of support.  Pre entry tests &amp; tasks need to be related to the VET course but they should not require prior knowledge Non-formal options for LLN assessments Formal tests are very intimidating for students. If it is possible it is a good idea to use less formal means of assessing the LLN needs of students at pre entry. In fact you are more likely to gain an accurate assessment of student's current LLN skills if they are relaxed and responsive to the assessment. For example a short literacy writing assessment could be part of the part of the enrolments process with a requirement for a written response (&frac12; page &ndash; one page depending on the level of the course) to the questions like:  How did you come to choose this course?  OR  What do you see yourself doing in five years time?  Some other effective methods of assessing LLN skills pre entry or in initial VET program classes are described below. Interviews Although interviews are time intensive, they can provide valid and useful information about pre entry LLN skills of your students. Questions about educational background assist teachers in identifying students who may need additional LLN support with their course. LLN issues related to interrupted schooling history, non completion of secondary education or non completion of requisite subjects like Maths at year 11 or 12 for example, for an electrical apprenticeship, can indicate students who will require extra or targeted support to successfully complete their VET program. It is also possible to follow up the initial part of an interview by asking students some questions that target critical skills identified by the staff as potential problems for students later in the course. Such interview assessment techniques should start gradually, so that students can exhibit skills they do have and gain confidence whilst leading them to the critical skill areas.  Target critical skills required for the course Self assessment checklists Students (particularly post entry) usually do not over estimate their own skills. Giving students a one page checklist containing statements which cover the underpinning competencies of your VET program which students are required to respond to allows students to reflect on their current skills as well as the skills they are required to develop to successfully complete their chosen VET program. LLN skills and perhaps also the current learning and study skills is invaluable for VET teacher trainers in program and course planning as strategic support and LLN skills development can be integrated into the VET program prior to the first assessment or assignment. Observation As well as analysing the results of any formal or non formal assessment you can also gain very useful information about LLN skills by observing how students are responding to either an assessment or even the enrolment process. LLN support needs may also be indicated by the length of time any assessment or enrolment process is taking students. A letter to students In the initial session of a VET program introductory activities could include a letter to students introducing yourself (could include family, likes, work history etc.) which students are required to read and then answer in a similar format and length ect. Because students are required to read the letter and then reply using their teacher's letter as a model for their own it is possible to use an introductory 'getting to know you activity' as an informal tool for assessing LLN.

Phlebotomy Today Taken from: McCall, R.E. &amp; Tankersley, C.M. (1998). Phlebotomy essentials. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven Publishers. Chapter 1. Phlebotomy: Past and Present, page 4. Note: Some medical terminology has been altered to reflect Australian spelling, by M. Colasante, RMIT. The practice of phlebotomy continues to this day; however, principles and methods have improved dramatically. Today, the main purpose of phlebotomy is to obtain blood for diagnostic testing. Phlebotomy procedures also are used to remove blood for transfusion purposes. Phlebotomy for therapeutic purposes is still practiced in certain instances, such as for a patient with polycythaemia, a disease involving over-production of red blood cells, or haemochromatosis, a rare disease characterized by excess iron deposits throughout the body. The use of leeches has reemerged with a new purpose: that of reducing haemostatic swelling after microsurgery until reconnected tissue can grow new capillaries and veins to carry deoxygenated blood away, thus improving circulation in the replanted tissue. Phlebotomy today is primarily accomplished by one of two procedures: (1) venepuncture, which involves collecting blood by penetrating a vein with a needle and syringe or other collection apparatus; and (2) skin puncture, which involves collecting blood after puncturing the skin with a lancet or similar skin puncture device. The role of the phlebotomist in the changing health environment: The term phlebotomist is applied to a person who has been trained to perform phlebotomy procedures. The primary responsibility of a phlebotomist is to collect blood for laboratory analysis, which is necessary for the diagnosis and care of a patient. Manual skills required are those necessary to obtain blood specimens by venepuncture and skin puncture techniques. Mental skills required are the ability to organise efficiently, perform under pressure, and follow written standardized procedures. Thorough knowledge of laboratory test requirements and departmental policies is also necessary.

Referring to the reading, what are some the skills a phlebotomist requires? Make a list of at least five, and write the answers as much as possible in your own words.             PART B Activity: Answer the following numeracy questions.  The reading on page one was written in 1998. How old is this information now? Pathology collectors are required to document the time of each specimen they collect. The time is recorded using a '24 hour clock', or 'army' time. For example, 1:00am is written as 0100 (or 0100hrs), and 10:30pm is written as 2230.  Rewrite the following times using the 24 hour clock method.   Rewrite the times as 24 hour times   Time Answer   (a) Six thirty in the morning     (b) Ten past five in the afternoon     (c) A quarter to eight in the morning     (d) Seventeen past three in the afternoon       3.Some pathology test collection procedures require a record of the client's height and weight. Use the two (2) tables on the following page to convert imperial measurements into metric measurements, to answer the questions below. 1.Ms Bertoli is to have an electrocardiography (heart rhythm test).

A Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) is a series of blood tests taken before and after your client drinks a glucose (sweet) drink. A common glucose drink used in the pathology collection industry is 'Glucoscan'. Glucoscan contains 75grams of glucose, in a 375ml drink, which is a standard GTT dose. If the doctor has requested a standard 75gram Glucose Tolerance Test, how many millilitres of Glucoscan does your client need to drink? * If you would normally use a calculator to work out similar problems, just write down what calculation you would type into the calculator to solve the above problems. For example, \"20 x 3 + 8 =\" 5. The electrocardiogram (heart rhythm recording machine) has a setting called 'calibration'. The pathology collector checks the calibration setting before performing an electrocardiography (ECG) If the normal calibration setting of '1', is represented below as diagram (b), and An alternative calibration of '1\/2' is represented by diagram (a).

In particular, many practical TAFE programs tend to attract students who are 'active' learners: ie those who have not enjoyed academic studies in school and who do not learn well by listening or reading for long periods. They just cannot keep listening and concentrating on received information for extended periods of time. Despite this, in the VET classroom it is common for 'theory' sessions to go far too long in the one mode of presentation. For example, expecting learners to read modules or listen to speakers' presentations for whole sessions is not unusual. Even a professional looking PowerPoint presentation will be ineffective if it goes on for too long. As famous author Mark Twain put it: If teaching were the same as telling, we'd all be so smart we could hardy stand it!    Teaching - more than the delivery of information!   Breaking teacher presentations with student action &ndash; changing modes Oral presentations or the spoken 'delivery' of information by the teacher are only effective if broken into small segments of 12-15 minutes maximum. These segments then need to be interspersed with some action on the students' part. For instance, after 12 minutes of topic input, which usually means students are listening, give them a change. Provide an opportunity to speak, write or read for a short while. For example, read and then talk about a case study in small groups (something that is even possible in a lecture theatre); write during an application or individual problem solving task; or put the last concept into their own words by speaking to one or two other people. Encouraging students to listen It also helps students to listen to presentations if the spoken words have visual support. Remember, a well chosen 'picture says a thousand words!' Illustrations are particularly helpful for visual learners. Visual learners, in fact most people, are also assisted by summaries or diagrams on an overhead or PowerPoint whilst you are talking. These can help clarify what you are saying and what is most important. They also aid student learning by reinforcing the message through two senses, seeing and hearing (visual and aural). Use story telling techniques, for example, tales of your own related experiences from the workplace. These not only make the topic come alive but also aid memory. It is far easier to remember a story because the images or visual pictures they convey can be more accessible in illustrating a point. Again this is particularly helpful for students whose preferred learning style is visual.  Change literacy modes! Listening - Speaking - Reading - Writing Speaking aids student learning Encouraging students to speak to one another and put ideas into their own words really helps them appreciate and remember the meanings behind the language and concepts. This can also be done by structuring short pair discussions of ideas into sessions, or providing opportunities to talk in groups or pairs about how newly introduced concepts will apply in particular cases.  'Talking the talk' of VET builds confidence Strategies which facilitate students to speak in class, such as pair or small group discussions, also help to build student confidence in speaking the language of the vocational field, as well as general confidence at speaking up in class discussions.   Encourage students speaking 'a little at a time' Encouraging students to speak in class Speaking in class is a terrible fear for many students, so strategies for building their competence and confidence to speak up a little at a time are very useful. It is a good idea to do this from the start of the VET course. This sets the expectation of their participation early and allows the students to build up to it in small steps To help students feel at ease speaking up in class it helps to know and trust the other members of the class. Introductory or 'Getting to know you' activities during the initial class are a first step in this process. It is best to use pair or small group formats for this, rather than expecting students to speak to the whole class on their first day. Encouraging students to work in new pair and group formations for the next few sessions will help them get to know even more students. Confidence building activities during class sessions also help to build a supportive community. For example:  Regular, quick 'whip arounds' of the class for opinions during discussions, or short answers to regular quizzes, keep students involved as well encouraging them to participate and discouraging them from hiding in the class. Exposing students to regular group and pair work also builds students' confidence to speak, particularly if each member of the group is encouraged to report back at some stage. Speaking to at least one other person is also helpful for students to sort out their thinking before speaking about their ideas to the whole class. Encourage students to tell their own stories, perhaps from the workplace or even their life experiences related to the topics. People tend to find it easier to talk about their experiences rather than abstract ideas. As mentioned above, stories, whether from the teacher, or other students, are a powerful aid to understanding and memory.

For instance, they might be about the steps involved in fitting an electrical switch, setting up and naming a word processing file or assembling equipment. Sequencing activities not only assist students to remember the order in cases where this is important, but give them a language to talk about the process eg, the names of the steps and the equipment used for them. Sequencing activities could involve text instructions, pictures and\/or diagrams or combinations of these. If used in groups or pairs then, in order to promote cooperation and discussion, the set of instructions are cut into strips for students in pairs or groups, to assemble correctly. Uses of sequencing activities Sequencing activities can be used in a variety of ways, for instance:  as a revision strategy at the beginning or end of a session, to turn passive reading of processes in text books and manual into meaningful activities, to promote student discussion during a class &bull;to change literacy mode during a teaching session, to bring students together during long practical workshops where they would primarily be working alone.   Benefits of sequencing activities Sequencing activities have a number of benefits they:  assist students remember a process, help students learn the names of the steps in a process and the tools used, encourage students to use the language associated with a process, promote student sharing of their understanding if used with pairs or small groups, Developing a sequencing activity for your teaching.  You can develop a sequencing activity from any set of instructions in a manual or textbook even if they are not already written in a step by step form. All you need to do is to rewrite the steps in clear simple sentences that are spaced out on the page to allow for cutting. Order the list of clearly in separate sentences and arrange them in a table for ease of cutting. Cut the pieces and place in an envelope or clip them together with a bulldog clip &ndash; make one set per pair or small group. How to paint clouds on a ceiling Michelangelo painted a ceiling and you can too! Here's how to create an airy, cloud-filled room. Ensure that you do not cut with wavy lines that can be matched up like a jigsaw afterwards because this defeats the purpose of promoting thinking about steps and language. Steps:  Remove or cover furniture and put down a drop cloth. Paint the ceiling blue and let it dry. Pour white paint into a roller tray. Holding a sponge flat, dip it into the paint. Dab the paint-filled sponge on the ceiling. Make clouds in a free-form shape. You may want to have some pictures of clouds on hand for reference. Use more paint in the centre of the cloud, and less paint as you move out toward the edges. Leave some areas of blue showing through the white for a light, transparent look. Make clouds of different sizes. Cover the ceiling evenly, but randomly, with clouds.  Follow as for Cloze or Matching or True or False.

We all suffer from information overload at some time so it is not surprising that&nbsp;VET students often complain about the amount of content and terminology that&nbsp;they have to learn and understand in a given period of time. Brain or content&nbsp;overload happens more frequently when there are just too many words, ideas or&nbsp;concepts (usually expressed in language) to learn at once. This is especially likely if&nbsp;motivation is low, or the concepts and language to be learned are difficult to&nbsp;understand. In fact too much information can even lead to brain shutdown!  Brain overload &rarr; Shutdown! The task of remembering How information is structured and taught obviously impacts on the ability of&nbsp;students to learn. In fact psychologists have found that we are only able to pay&nbsp;attention to between 5-7 pieces of information at a time. For example when asking&nbsp;for directions if there are more than 5-7 steps in the answer the memory often&nbsp;falters or if you have tried to remember a long shopping list in your head you'll&nbsp;probably come back from the supermarket without all the things you need. This&nbsp;phenomenon is often called the 'bottleneck problem': too much information to be&nbsp;processed at a time from short term memory to storage in long term memory.  'in one ear and out the other' Often it is really a case of 'in one ear and out the other'.  In practical terms this means after listening to a lecture or class session or after&nbsp;reading an instruction manual or textbook there is a limit to how much information&nbsp;can be remembered. Everything else will be forgotten! How often do you find that&nbsp;your students have hardly remembered a thing from yesterday's class?  Solving the bottleneck problem Chunking - organising content to assist learning One of the strategies in remembering and getting round the bottleneck problem is to organize information so that it is easier to remember. 'Chunking' involves organizing a number of little ideas or bits of information into bundles or categories to make remembering them easier. The filing cabinet metaphor We could think of the brain in comparison to a filing cabinet. Like all filing cabinets it can either be organised effectively or badly. If there are lots of unrelated and random bits all jumbled in together then it is hard to access information when you need it. However if the information is chunked or connected together in some meaningful way, then it becomes a useful, retrievable store of information.  Chunk content! Remembering phone numbers - an example of chunking A simple example of this is the way some of us have learned to remember 10 digit mobile phone numbers. As a string of single entities 10 digits such as 0431653363 are far too much for the brain to remember. Instead we try to remember by grouping the digits into chunks like 0431 &ndash; 653 &ndash; 563.  The grocery list example Another example is a grocery list. It can be items randomly scattered on a piece of paper: Grocery list  Or it can be organised under category headings  Deli - olives, ham , cheese, dips Cans &ndash; tomato pulp, baked beans, tuna Cleaning - dishwashing liquid, disinfectant, sponges Toiletries - soap, toothpaste, deodorant, aspirin   In this example, having the correct conceptual language (name of the category) - is the key to finding the appropriate heading and so to accessing the information stored within it. Organising content to assist learning It is really useful to keep these ideas in mind when planning content within vocational courses. It helps to remind us to keep information in manageable 'chunks' for learning and to focus on making connections between the chunks as each new one is introduced This is useful whether students are trying to listen to information presented orally or reading learning materials. If there is too much information at once it can become a jumble in the brain, if it gets there at all.  Making links or connecting to 'schemas' Another related strategy for remembering new information is to actively link new ideas to associated collections of information in our long term memory. These collections of information are usually stored in interconnected categories, known as 'schemas'. We can think of the brain's storage system for memories as like bunches of fish hooks rather than a pile of marbles. Whereas fish hooks can link together, marbles scatter and can't be found easily when you need them. If information is not organised in your brain it is difficult to locate, so making clear links or interconnections between bits of information can help ensure that it is stored in the right place. This way it is easier to remember when you need it. Make links to previous content. Fish hooks not marbles! Providing overviews &amp; summaries Teachers can assist students' learning by making clear what is important and, in a sense, modelling to the students how to organise their content. Going over the main ideas, key concepts or the important big chunks for a session or unit of study as a brief overview at the beginning gives student a way in to identifying, naming and organising the key chunks of information and language and linking this information with what they already know so that real understanding can take place. Understanding and linking to prior knowledge is a key to remembering. It also helps to finish a session or unit of work with a short summary of key ideas or main points.  Make clear what is important! Using remembering strategies in the VET classroom It is useful to keep these ideas in mind when planning content within vocational courses. Knowledge of how memory works reminds us to keep information in manageable 'chunks' for learning and to focus on actively making connections between the chunks as each new one is introduced. As teachers we may 'cover the curriculum' by presenting a great deal of information in every session, but the effect on students learning is doubtful.   Less is more! Learn a little at a time. 'Less is more' &ndash; chunking curriculum content When information is broken into smaller topic chunks so students can engage with a little at a time, it becomes easier to learn. The language and terminology of modules can be transferred gradually, in small clusters, into the long term memory. This way the students can build their vocational knowledge and its related language in achievable chunks. Following this thinking, it is easier to see why 'less is more' or less content delivered can be more content understood in the long term. Get students to engage with the chunks A little at a time &ndash; 'engaging' with the chunks We mentioned above that learners should be given a chance to 'engage' with the smaller chunks of information, before a new one is introduced. This means providing a space between each chunk for learners to interact with the knowledge or information that has just been introduced. Doing something with new ideas gives students a chance to focus and hopefully understand them better. It is almost impossible to remember content that you have not actively engaged with or understood. An effective strategy is to change the literacy mode after a new content chunk. For example, switching from reading to listening or talking about the topic are means of changing mode.  Engaging students with real life examples or stories Another way of changing literacy mode is the use of stories. Have you noticed how students really start to listen when you tell them a story 'from the coalface': an anecdote about your own workplace experience that relates to the knowledge you are teaching them? It is often a story with a message &ndash; a tale of catastrophe due to the lack of knowledge or planning - but it has a memorable effect. Stories tend to stick in the memory when all other details of a class are forgotten. Many vocational teachers tell 'on the job' stories naturally, without being particularly conscious that they are using a powerful teaching strategy. It is however, a strategy we can all learn from. It is a great way to make a topic come alive, to engage and motivate students and give them a way into remembering the topic. Workplace anecdotes can be used to relate real life examples to abstract ideas (practice with theory). Somehow personalising these 'case studies' is even more powerful because they happened to someone the students can relate to &ndash; this provides an extra memory hook. Often when teachers find themselves rushing to 'get through the curriculum' they stop telling their stories and so this very effective teaching device can be lost.  Use real life examples &amp; stories from the 'coalface' Students telling their own stories Similarly, it is empowering to encourage students to share relevant stories and anecdotes with each other. These will not only be remembered by other students they can become case studies to build future teaching around as a way of valuing student input and increasing motivation and involvement. Encouraging students to tell their own stories is also a way of engaging with a chunk of content and a change of literacy mode to students speaking.

Are they persuasive? Is she demonstrating bias?\n\nKeywords(tags): Academic writing, Analysis, Critical reading, Critical thinking, Default\n\n\n\nWhat language techniques does Dawson use in her article? Are they persuasive? Is she demonstrating bias? Article summary In this article, the author Emma Dawson, has another look at the idea of a Universal Basic Income: a minimum, basic wage paid to all adults, regardless of their personal assets or income status. Dawson looks at the argument from different perspectives, including neo-liberalism and public reliance on the free market. Dawson considers the stigma associated with those who are on welfare payments, whether that is a good argument to support the UBI, and the true cost of implementing the UBI compared with our current welfare system. Author (Emma Dawson) demonstrates her bias in the article through the language she used to present counter arguments. To do this, Dawson refers to another writer's argument (or claim) and counters that with her own argument (claim) and evidence. Author (Dawson) presents three clear counter arguments  tax churn cash for welfare allows the government to take away basic welfare services to make people pay for them UBI robs people of agency: assumes that people do not want to work and ignores the value of work beyond earning an income.  Language used to make arguments Colours highlight the language that can indicate a purpose, direction, personal bias, persuasive language, cautious language. Let's look at how the language is used to persuade the reader. Persuasive language includes:  .att {background: var(--yellow-light); padding: 4px 4px 4px 0;} .emo {background: var(--blue-light); padding: 4px 4px 4px 0;} .ass {background: var(--pink-light); padding: 4px 4px 4px 0;} .ane {background: var(--green-light); padding: 4px 4px 4px 0;} .hborder tr { border-bottom: 1px solid black; border-top: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; } .hborder tr.hhead { border-bottom: none; border-top: none; border-collapse: collapse; }  Ridicule, attacks Good luck selling that to the Australian public, Senator Di Natale.  Emotional language (key emotional words are emphasised) A UBI robs people of agency. It completely ignores the value of work beyond earning an income. The fact is, work is critical to people's sense of identity.  Assumption First there is the issue of tax churn.  Anecdotal evidence I'm yet to meet a proponent of the UBI from a working-class background. It's the latest pet policy of the post material-ist middle class.     The analysis of the arguments Sample from article    Dawson's main argument   It is an unworkable system because there are too many problems with the proposed UBI. A better solution is to provide adequate welfare support where needed.     Claims from other sources that Dawson argues against Dawson contextualises the popularity of the UBI with some politicians.   The UBI   is fashionable with progressive politicians,   could deliver certainty and power to Australian workers and   would not act as a disincentive for people working.       Counter claims put up by author Dawson sets up arguments that she plans to shoot down. She sets them up with emotive language techniques which weaken their position to begin with.   It is equitable It would destigmatise welfare It would empower workers to demand reasonable wages.     Evidence Dawson argues against the UBI with three points of evidence. Note that the evidence is weak as there are no references attached to them. Dawson provides evidence to support the original claim that the UBI system is unworkable. The evidence she gives is based on:   Cost: current welfare budget $160 billion, compared with modest  UBI cost estimate  of $300 billion. Tax churn: It is a pointless process  in cases where high income earners would receive payment, then return it as tax . Ulterior motive: She claims that the UBI is part of a plot to reduce the size of government and increase people's reliance  on the market. She does this by quoting names of conservative thinker Charles Murray &amp; neo-liberalist Milton Friedman.     Dawson's counterclaim An introduction to the key points (the counter claims) that the author uses to argue against the claim made in favour of the UBI.   By replacing welfare programs with UBI, the government can stop delivering basic services and allow people to buy the services from private providers. Better that government provides universal services, reversing privatisation and for-profit . UBI robs  people of agency, ignoring the value of work  beyond earning an income, work also gives people a sense of identity .     Claim from other sources that Dawson argues against&nbsp;(reported by Dawson) An overall summation statement of the original text, by Dawson, to introduce what she is about to argue against.   There is evidence that providing an income for those who cannot work or are retired, contributes to their health and happiness because of ease of access .     Dawson's counterclaim (acknowledge and refute) The author selects parts of the claims, isolates them from the complete texts and uses them as points to argue against. This selection of claims, matched with the author's counter claims, makes it the original claims look flawed.    The above is a compelling  argument, but is not an argument for UBI, rather putting in a less punitive approach to welfare .     Claims from other sources, reported by author   \"Problems\"  \"unworkable systems\"  &ndash; negative terms. \"Fashionable with progressive politicians\" &ndash; dismissive, temporary, without substance. \"Could deliver certainty and power...\"  &ndash; uncertain, maybe (modal verbs). \"Would not act as a disincentive..\"  &ndash; uncertain, depending on unknowns. \"It's the latest pet policy of the post-materialist middle class.\" &ndash; ridicule, dismissive. \"Modest\" &amp; \"estimate\"  &ndash; underplaying the actual costs (a warning). \"Receive\" then \"return it as tax\"  &ndash; used to describe \"tax churn\" &ndash; not achieving anything, a waste of time and resources. \"support UBI as a way to reduce the size of government and increase people's reliance  on the market\" &ndash; ulterior motive, unrealistic, or dishonest. \"Most people want to provide for themselves, rather than rely on support from the state\"&nbsp; &ndash; an unverified assumption, no reference provided. \"I'm yet to meet a proponent of the UBI from a working class background\"&nbsp; &ndash; anecdotal evidence, very limited and without evidence.

Dawson firstly takes a stance against UBI by introducing weakened arguments for it that can be easily undermined. She offers evidence based on cost and perceived philosophical grounds. However she refutes the cost argument. By appealing to paranoia, and using sarcasm and emotive vocabulary, she also undermines the philosophical stance. Dawson then switches focus, introducing the notion of welfare and fair taxation. She casts this as a positive, being the opposite of a UBI based on the size of government and extent of privatisation. Dawson then selects a criticism against the UBI that can also be refuted and reframes these to support her criticism for the UBI. Dawson works under the assumption that her proposed taxation\/welfare system is a compromise position between having or not having UBI. She is exploiting the argumentative device of the \"Middle Ground\" where one assumes \"because two opposing arguments have merit, the answer must lie somewhere between them\" (McCandless 2012). Between the debunked strengths of UBI and the debunked criticisms of UBI, Dawson concludes that the answer is her proposed tax\/welfare reform. She manages to achieve this with minimum to no discussion of the proposal itself at all. She has implemented a bait and switch technique by arguing another matter and introducing the true claim at the last minute.

One way to avoid this, is to have team members revise each other's work, paying close attention to their references and citations. Do not accept outside help The ideas and data expressed in your group's work should only come from the members of the group. Allowing someone who is not in your group to contribute to your work could be viewed as breach of the academic integrity standards of your university.  Always refer to the assignment brief Group work can take a number of different forms, so reading the assignment brief carefully and seeking clarification from your teacher where there is any doubt is essential to avoid unintentional breaches of academic integrity. Where work is to be submitted in sections by students, ensure that you never take credit for the work done by another member of your group, as this is considered plagiarism.","excerpt":"nodeID: 1287 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: It is important to be conscious of academic integrity while working in a group.

We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In words, the \\(a\\) outside the bracket multiplies everything inside the bracket.\r\n\r\nFor example, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\left(3+5\\right) &amp; =2\\times3+2\\times5. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nRemoving the brackets is called expansion.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tExpand \\(3\\left(x+2\\right)\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =3\\times x+3\\times2\\\\ &amp; =3x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-5\\left(m+4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -5\\left(m+4\\right) &amp; =\\left(-5\\right)\\times m+\\left(-5\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-5m-20. \\end{align*}\\] Usually we omit the first step shown above and expand directly as shown in the following examples.\r\n \tExpand \\(-2\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =-2p+14. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(e\\left(e+2\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} e\\left(e+2\\right) &amp; =e^{2}+2e. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-\\left(4p-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -\\left(4p-3\\right) &amp; =-4p+3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right) &amp; =4x-12+2x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x-10. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right) &amp; =12k^{2}+18k-3k^{2}+9k\\\\ &amp; =9k^{2}+27k. \\end{align*}\\] Now do some practice. See Exercise \\(1\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBinomial products\r\nA binomial product is something like \\(\\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right).\\) It is the product of two binomial terms.1 A binomial term is an expression involving two terms. Examples are: \\(a+3\\), \\(1+c,\\) \\(a+b,\\) and \\(\\left(3x+2y\\right)\\). \r\n\r\nTo expand the two brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. Then simplify if possible. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right) &amp; =m\\left(m+3\\right)+2\\left(m+3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+3m+2m+6\\\\ &amp; =m^{2}+5m+6. \\end{align*}\\] Symbolically we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)\\left(c+d\\right) &amp; =ac+ad+bc+bd. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTwo important cases\r\nSpecial cases arise when the binomial terms are the same. That is \\(\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)=\\left(a+b\\right)^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)=\\left(a-b\\right)^{2}\\).\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+ab+ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}+2ab+b^{2} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(a-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-ab-ba+b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These occur often in mathematics and you should commit them to memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2f+3\\right)\\left(g+5h\\right) &amp; =2fg+\\left(2f\\right)\\left(5h\\right)+3g+15h\\\\ &amp; =2fg+10fh+3g+15h. \\end{align*}\\] In this case not further simplification is possible.\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(p-2\\right)\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =p^{2}-7p-2p+14\\\\ &amp; =p^{2}-9p+14 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2w+3\\right)\\left(w-4\\right) &amp; =2w^{2}-8w+3w-12\\\\ &amp; =2w^{2}-5w-12 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(\\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2}.\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\left(4r-3s\\right)\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-12rs-12sr+9s^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] This can be done faster if you remember eqn (2) above: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(4r-3s\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(4r\\right)^{2}-2\\left(4r\\right)\\left(3s\\right)+\\left(-3s\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =16r^{2}-24rs+9s^{2} \\end{align*}\\] For some practice, please try out Exercise 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\n\r\n \tRemove the brackets:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;2\\left(x-5\\right) &amp; b)\\;3\\left(6-b\\right) &amp; c)\\;\\left(b+5\\right)c\\\\ d)\\;2x\\left(2a+3b\\right) &amp; e)\\;-6\\left(p-2q+4\\right) &amp; f)\\;3y\\left(yz-2y+1\\right) \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n \tExpand and simplify:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;3\\left(x+1\\right)+2\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; b)\\;2\\left(p-1\\right)-\\left(p-3\\right) &amp; c)\\;2\\left(4m-3\\right)-5\\left(9-2m\\right)\\\\ d)\\;2w\\left(3w+1\\right)+3w\\left(2w-5\\right) &amp; e)\\;2a\\left(a-1\\right)-a\\left(a-3\\right) &amp; f)\\;5j\\left(3j+2\\right)-2j\\left(4j-1\\right)\\\\ g)\\;3q\\left(5q+4\\right)+6\\left(8-3q\\right) &amp; h)\\;2r\\left(3r-1\\right)-3r\\left(3+2r\\right) \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n \tExpand the following expressions and simplify where possible remembering the correct order of operations.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;4\\left(2m-3\\right)+8 &amp; b)\\;9-3\\left(4b+3\\right) &amp; c)\\;1-4\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ d)\\;4-\\left(5-2x\\right) &amp; e)\\;8m-3\\left(1-2m\\right)+6 &amp; f)\\;9c\\left(4-c\\right)+2\\left(c-7\\right) \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\n\r\n \tExpand the following binomial products:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;\\left(x+5\\right)\\left(x+3\\right) &amp; b)\\;\\left(u-5\\right)\\left(u+3\\right) &amp; c)\\;\\left(k+6\\right)\\left(j+1\\right)\\\\ d)\\;\\left(y+2\\right)\\left(y-2\\right) &amp; e)\\;\\left(e-7\\right)\\left(e-8\\right) &amp; f)\\;\\left(t-3\\right)\\left(5-t\\right)\\\\ g)\\;\\left(3q+2\\right)\\left(q+1\\right) &amp; h)\\;\\left(8a+5\\right)\\left(a-3\\right) &amp; i)\\;\\left(2c-d\\right)\\left(3c+2d\\right)\\\\ j)\\;\\left(3a-2b\\right)\\left(3a+2b\\right) \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n \tRemove the brackets:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} a)\\;\\left(d+3\\right)^{2} &amp; b)\\;\\left(x-2\\right)^{2} &amp; c)\\;\\left(3v+2\\right)^{2}\\\\ d)\\;\\left(y-3z\\right)^{2} &amp; e)\\;\\left(3-2q\\right)^{2} &amp; f)\\;\\left(4f-3gh\\right)^{2} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, A1.3 Removing brackets (PDF 129KB)\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What do I do with the brackets?

For example, \\(3x\\) is a pro-numeral. In algebra, when we write \\(3x\\) we really mean \\(3\\times x\\). Another example of a pro-numeral is \\(5ab\\). This means \\(5\\times a\\times b\\). Note that \\(5ab=5ba\\). The order of the letters and numbers is not important but usually we write numbers first and use alphabetical order for the letters.

It is possible to do this even when the fractions include pronumerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview of ordinary fractions\r\nThe basic concept is that only fractions with a common denominator may be added or subtracted.1 The denominator is the number or pro-numeral on the bottom of the fraction. The number on top is called the numerator. For the fraction \\(2\/5\\), the numerator is \\(2\\) and the denominator is \\(5.\\) \r\n\r\nFor example:2 In this example the common denominator is \\(10\\times7=70.\\) So we want the denominator to be \\(70\\) for both fractions. This is done by multiplying by \\(7\/7\\) and \\(10\/10\\) respectively. Note that these are both equal to one and so you change nothing when you multiply a fraction by them. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{7}{10}-\\frac{3}{7} &amp; =\\frac{7}{10}\\times\\frac{7}{7}-\\frac{3}{7}\\times\\frac{10}{10},\\;\\textrm{common denominator is $70,$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{49}{70}-\\frac{30}{70}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{49-30}{70}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{19}{70}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebraic fractions\r\nAlgebraic fractions are fractions that involve pro-numerals. For example:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\frac{a}{2},\\,\\frac{2b}{3},\\,\\frac{1}{2c},\\,\\frac{e+1}{2},\\,\\frac{3}{a-2},\\,\\frac{a}{b},\\,\\frac{a}{b+c} \\] are algebraic fractions.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic fractions can be added and subtracted in a similar way to ordinary fractions. The same concepts apply.

The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying fractions\r\nYou have probably seen numerical fractions like \\(\\frac{18}{24}\\) before. Generally we like to reduce fractions to their simplest form. This is done by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.1 The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number at the bottom of the fraction.\r\n\r\nSo \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{18}{24} &amp; =\\frac{9}{12}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ three} \\end{alignat*}\\] this is the simplest form as there is no number that divides into \\(3\\) and \\(4\\). Note that this can be done in one step if you realise that \\(6\\) divides into \\(18\\) and \\(24\\). Then you have \\[ \\frac{18}{24}=\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ six.} \\] Simplifying fractions by dividing the same number into both the numerator and denominator is called cancelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying algebraic fractions\r\nWe can use the same technique to simplify algebraic fractions as we did in simplifying numerical fractions. For example:\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}}\\).\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}y}{3y^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}}{3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:y. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab}.\\)\r\nThis example shows it is important to divide all terms on the top by the same number.2 Note that you cannot divide the \\(2c\\) on top and the \\(2b\\) on the bottom by \\(2\\). This is because all the terms on the top and bottom have to be divided by \\(2\\). So it would be wrong to write \\[ \\frac{b+2c}{2b}=\\frac{b+c}{b} \\] because the \\(b\\) on the top line was not divided by \\(2\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab} &amp; =\\frac{(b+2c)}{2b}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:a\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{b+2c}{2b}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}}\\). 3 This example uses the fact that \\(\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}=\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)\\). Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are just numbers, \\(m-n\\) is also a number and so we can divide by \\(m-n\\) provided that \\(m\\neq n\\). If \\(m=n\\), \\(m-n=0\\) and we mustn\u2019t divide anything by zero. \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)}\\quad\\left(m\\neq n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{m-n}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:m-n. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y}.\\) 4 This example factorizes the denominator first. We then divide the top and bottom of the fraction by the common factor \\(3\\).  \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y} &amp; =\\frac{3x^{2}y}{3\\left(2x+3y\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{2}y}{2x+3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:3. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)}.\\) 5 This example uses the fact that \\(p-2=-\\left(2-p\\right).\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)} &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3\\left(2p-p^{2}\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(2-p\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:\\mathit{p}\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(p-2\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{using\\;\\mathit{p-\\mathrm{2}=-\\left(\\mathrm{2}-p\\right)}}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3p}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:p-2. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you can only divide the denominator and numerator if ALL the terms have a common factor. For example, it would be WRONG to write \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x+2}{2y} &amp; =\\frac{x+1}{y} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nbecause the \\(x\\) in the top line has not been divided by 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo practice these techniques, please look at Exercise 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying fractions\r\nWhen we multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators of each fraction. For example, \\[ \\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{7}{5}=\\frac{21}{20}. \\]\r\n\r\nIt is best to simplify each fraction, if possible, before you do the multiplication. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{15}{8}\\times\\frac{24}{35} &amp; =\\frac{15}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{35}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;24\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:8\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:8}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{7}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;15\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:35\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{7}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying algebraic fractions\r\nYou can also use these ideas with algebraic fractions. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5a}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{a} &amp; =\\frac{5}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{1}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;5\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{a}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\quad\\:\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;14\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{7}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{7}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{1}\\\\ &amp; =10. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nHere are some more examples:6 Note that we are showing every step in the examples below and so the solutions may appear long and complicated. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can take as many steps as you like. As you get more familiar with algebra you will naturally use fewer steps to get a result.\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}}\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{x}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x-2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2x}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}.\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m} &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m\\left(m+4\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:by\\:\\mathit{m+4}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{5}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2m}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing fractions\r\nThe reciprocal of a fraction is just the fraction turned upside down. So the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) and the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.7 When dividing fractions we change the divide sign to times and turn the last fraction upside down.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5}{4}\\div\\frac{19}{8} &amp; =\\frac{5}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{19}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing algebraic fractions\r\nWe use the same technique for dividing algebraic fractions as we use for dividing numerical fractions.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8} &amp; =\\frac{7p}{12}\\times\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7p}{3}\\times\\frac{2}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{14p}{9}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m\\). 8 Don\u2019t forget that \\(6m=\\frac{6m}{1}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div\\frac{6m}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6m}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{6n}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x} &amp; =\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{24}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5x\\left(x+3\\right)}{54}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6} &amp; =\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(a+2\\right)}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercise 1\r\nSimplify the following fractions:\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\frac{12ab^{2}}{8bc}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{5x-20}{5}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9u-18}{2u-4}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{6t-9}{12-8t}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{b}{b^{2}+7b}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{\\left(j+4\\right)\\left(j-4\\right)}{3j+12}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{2\\left(5-v\\right)}{3v-15}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9r^{2}-3r}{16r-48r^{2}}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nA.

For example, the formula for simple interest is:1 Note that when we write \\(nr\\) we mean \\(n\\times r\\). Most of the time we ignore the multiplication sign \u201c\\(\\times\\)\u201d as it can be confused with \\(x\\). Also when we write \\(A=P(1+nr)\\) the \\(P\\) outside the bracket is multiplying everything in the bracket. That is we mean \\(A=P\\times\\left(1+nr\\right)\\). For the same reason we do not write the multiply sign. \\[ A=P(1+nr) \\] Here, \\(A\\) is the amount you have after \\(n\\) time periods (months or years usually), \\(P\\) is the amount you invest, and \\(r\\) is the interest rate per time period. \\(A\\) is called the of the formula because the formula is in the form \\(A\\) is equal to \u2026 .\r\n\r\nWhat about if we want \\(P\\) to be the subject? As a first step we could get rid of the \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\) term that is multiplying \\(P\\). The opposite of multiplication is division. To get rid of the \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\) we divide both sides of the formula by \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\).2 When rearranging formulas, the main rule is: whatever you do to one side you must do to the other.\r\n\r\nWhat we get is:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=\\frac{P(1+nr)}{(1+nr)} \\] Now the \\((1+nr)\\) terms can be canceled to get: \\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=P \\] or \\[ P=\\frac{A}{(1+nr)} \\]\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging formulas, the starting point depends on the formula itself. We illustrate this in the examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSuppose you have $1000 to invest and you want to know how long it will take to get $2000 with an interest rate of 5% per year with simple interest.\r\nThe formula for simple interest is \\[ A=P(1+rn) \\] and we know A=$2000, \\(P=\\$1000\\) and \\(r=5%=5\/100=0.05\\). We want to find \\(n\\).\r\nSolution:\r\nOur first step is to get rid of the \\(P\\) that is multiplying the bracket \\((1+rn)\\). We do this by dividing both sides by \\(P\\) to get \\[ \\frac{A}{P}=\\frac{P(1+rn)}{P}. \\] Now we cancel the \\(P\\) to get 3 There is actually a 1 multiplying the bracket we never show it. Because multiplying by 1 does not change anything, we can remove the brackets as shown below. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P} &amp; =\\left(1+rn\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1+rn. \\end{align*}\\] Next we want to get the \\(rn\\) on its own. We do this by subtracting 1 from both sides to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P}-1 &amp; =1+rn-1\\\\ &amp; =rn. \\end{align*}\\] The last step is to get \\(n\\) on its own. We do this by dividing both sides by \\(r\\)4 Remember dividing by \\(r\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1\/r\\).\r\n\\[ \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)=\\frac{nr}{r}. \\] Canceling the \\(r\\) on the right hand side gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right) &amp; =n\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] We can now calculate \\(n\\) by substituting the values for \\(A\\), \\(P\\) and \\(r\\): \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{0.05}\\left(\\frac{2000}{1000}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =20. \\end{align*}\\] So it will take 20 years to double the initial $1000 investment!\r\n \tTransform the formula \\(P=2(L-W)\\) to make \u2018\\(L\\)\u2019 the subject.\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =2\\left(L-W\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(L-W\\right)}{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{divide both sides by 2}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =L-W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{cancel the 2 and remove the brackets}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2}+W &amp; =L-W+W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{add $W$ to both sides}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =L\\\\ L &amp; =\\frac{P}{2}+W\\quad\\textrm{rearrange to put $L$ on the left}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that you don\u2019t have to put explanations on each line in your solution.

We also use a square root function (the opposite to squaring) to get \\(v\\) from \\(v^{2}\\) in the last line. Note that taking the square root of a positive number gives two possibilities - one positive, the other negative. Usually a formula will relate to a physical situation and the negative solution may not make sense. In this case, you take the positive solution as the answer.

You don\u2019t have to do that when answering questions.

You then proceed as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tFor example, make \\(u\\) the subject of the formula \\(1\/f=1\/v-1\/u\\). A suitable common divisor of the denominators is \\(fvu\\).3 A common divisor is the product of the denominators. For example to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}\\) you can use a lowest common denominator of \\(8\\) or a common denominator of \\(8\\times4=32\\). Either will give the same result, though the lowest common denominator involves smaller numbers. To simplify algebraic fractions like \\(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}\\) we must use a common denominator \\(v\\times u=vu\\) as we don\u2019t know the values of \\(v\\) and \\(u\\).  Multiplying both sides of the formula by \\(fvu\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{f}fvu &amp; =\\frac{1}{v}fvu-\\frac{1}{u}fvu\\\\ vu &amp; =fu-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{after canceling the terms}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Next step is to get all terms involving \\(u\\) on the same side: \\[\\begin{align*} vu-fu &amp; =-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtracting $fu$ from both sides}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now we factorize the left hand side: \\[\\begin{align*} u\\left(v-f\\right) &amp; =-fv. \\end{align*}\\] The final step is to divide both sides by \\(v-f\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv}{v-f}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{fv}{v-f}. \\end{align*}\\] This is a correct answer but having a \\(-\\) sign in front is ugly. We get rid of it by multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by \\(-1\\): \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv\\left(-1\\right)}{\\left(v-f\\right)\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{fv}{\\left(f-v\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The example above showed all steps. You don\u2019t have to provide such detail. An acceptable solution would be: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{f} &amp; =\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}\\\\ vu &amp; =fu-fv\\\\ u\\left(v-f\\right) &amp; =-fv\\\\ u &amp; =\\frac{-fv}{v-f}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{fv}{f-v}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tTranspose \\(m=\\sqrt{\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}}\\) to make \\(s\\) the subject.\r\nThe square root sign acts as a bracket and we want to remove it so we can get at the subject term \\(s\\).4 The term \\(\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}\\) is considered as a single term. We remove it by squaring both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} m^{2} &amp; =\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}}\\right)^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{d-s}{s\\left(e-f\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] Now multiply both sides by \\(s\\left(e-f\\right)\\) to get:5 Note that \\(m^{2}=m^{2}\/1\\) and so the common denominator of both sides is \\(1\\times s\\left(e-f\\right)=s\\left(e-f\\right)\\). By multiplying by \\(s\\left(e-f\\right)\\)we remove fractions. \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}= &amp; d-s. \\end{align*}\\] Now we gather all the \\(s\\) terms to one side. We add \\(s\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+s= &amp; d. \\end{align*}\\] Take a common factor of \\(s\\) out of the right hand side: \\[\\begin{align*} s\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right) &amp; =d. \\end{align*}\\] Now we divide by \\(\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right)\\) to get the result \\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =\\frac{d}{\\left(\\left(e-f\\right)m^{2}+1\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The example above showed all steps. You don\u2019t have to provide such detail.

This section includes algebraic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric examples.  It is not always convenient to use differentiation from first principles to find a derivative function. The \u201crules\u201d shown below have been established from first principles and can be used to find derivative functions directly.      Alternative Notations We will also introduce alternative notations for derivatives. When \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\), i.e.\u00a0\\(y=f(x)\\), the derivative function may be written as \\(y'\\) or \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) or \\(f'(x)\\). It is important to understand that \\(d\/dx\\) is a symbol that means \u201ctake the derivative of something with respect to \\(x\\)\u201d. For example \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] means take the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\)   Operational Rules Here are some rules for these are essential and underlie much of what you will use in your course. In this section we present the rules and give some examples.

Antidifferentiation (also called integration) is the opposite operation to differentiation. If you have the differentiation of a function, you can then obtain the original function via integration (antidifferentiation).  Given a derivative \\(f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right)\\) of a function we want to find the original function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\). The original function is called an antiderivative. Play a short video on Antidifferentiation.  The Basic Concept Think about the following examples:  If \\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\), then \\(f'\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) so \\(\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\)is an antiderivative of \\(x^{2}\\). If \\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+1\\), then \\(f'\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) so \\(\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+1\\) is an antiderivative of \\(x^{2}\\). If \\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+2\\), then \\(f'\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) so \\(\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+2\\) is an antiderivative of \\(x^{2}\\).  Notice that adding a constant to \\(\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\) does not change the fact it is an antiderivative of \\(x^{2}.\\) This is because the derivative of a constant is zero. In general an antiderivative of \\(f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right)\\) is given by \\(f\\left(x\\right)+c\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant1 We often write \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) which means that \\(c\\) is a real number..   Finding Antiderivatives Antidifferentiation is more complicated than differentiation. However there are some rules to help us. One of the most important is the power rule which says2 Note that if \\(n=-1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\) would be \\(\\frac{1}{0}\\) which has no meaning. Apart from this restriction, \\(n\\) can be any number.:   If \\(f'\\left(x\\right)=x^{n}\\), \\(n\\neq-1\\) the antiderivative \\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+c,\\) where \\(c\\) is a constant.    Alternate Notation If \\(y=f(x)\\) then \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)\\). If \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=x^{n},\\) the antiderivative \\(y=\\) \\(\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+c\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant.

Consequently an understanding of linear graphs is an essential requirement for many courses in science, engineering and mathematics. This module deals with linear graphs.  The Cartesian Plane The Cartesian plane is defined by a pair of mutually perpendicular coordinate axes. The horizontal axis is the x- axis and the vertical axis the y \u2013 axis. Their point of intersection is called the origin O. Points on the plane are referred to by their horizontal distance (\\(x\\) \u2013 coordinate) and vertical distance (\\(y\\) \u2013 coordinate) from the origin. Distances to the right of, and up from the origin are positive. Distances to the left of, and down from the origin are negative. Consider the figure below.  The \\(x\\) \u2013 coordinate is always given first. The point A (\\(2,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=3\\). The point B (\\(1,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=1\\) and \\(y=3\\). The point C (\\(3,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=3\\) and \\(y=3\\). The point D (\\(3,4\\)) has coordinates \\(x=3\\) and \\(y=4\\).   Sketch Graphs When sketching a graph it is not necessary to plot large numbers of points. Only the basic shape of the graph is required, although some important points need to be clearly labeled.  Intercepts These are the points where the graph crosses the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. The \\(x\\)-intercept is where the graph cuts the \\(x\\)-axis \\(\\left(y=0\\right)\\) and the \\(y\\)-intercept is where the graph cuts the \\(y\\)-axis \\(\\left(x=0\\right)\\).    Linear Graphs The graph of a linear relationship is a straight line. Only two points are needed to sketch the graph of a straight line.  Example Sketch the function \\(y=3x+6\\). Solution: Determine two points on the line. The \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)-intercepts are often the easiest to find. For the \\(y\\)- intercept \\(\\left(x=0\\right)\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =3x+6\\\\ &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,6\\right)\\). Now we want the \\(x\\)- intercept \\(\\left(y=0\\right).\\) So \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 0 &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 3x &amp; =-6\\\\ x &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(-2,0\\right).\\) The y-intercept is the point \\((0,6\\)). \\[\\begin{align*} x\\textrm{-intercept} &amp; (y=0)\\\\ \\textrm{When }y &amp; =0\\\\ 0 &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 3x &amp; =-6\\\\ x &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] The x-intercept is the point ( 2, 0). Connect the two points with a straight line.  The \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts should be marked on the graph.   See Exercise 1      Gradient The slope of the straight line is called the gradient. This is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between two points (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) and (\\(x_{2},y_{2}\\)) on the line. \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{rise}{run}=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} \\end{align*}\\]   Examples  Find the gradient of the line \\(y=3x+6\\) (see previous example). Solution: The points (\\(0,6\\)) and (\\(-2,0\\)) are on the line \\(y=3x+6\\).1 Note that it doesn\u2019t matter which points you choose for \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right)\\). The only requirement is that both points must be on the line. For example we could let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6-0}{0-\\left(-2\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =3 \\end{align*}\\] the same answer as at left. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{0-6}{-2-0}=\\frac{-6}{-2}=3. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is 3. Find the gradient of the line joining the two points \\(\\left(1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4,5\\right).\\) Solution: Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(4,5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{5-3}{4-1}=\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is \\(2\/3.\\)    See Exercise 2      Equation of a Straight Line The general equation of a straight line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient, and \\(c\\) is the value of the intercept on the \\(y\\)-axis. The figure below illustrates this.  The equation of a straight line can also be written as2 To see this, assume you know a point \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) on the line and the gradient \\(m\\) of the line. Since \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) is on the line, it must satisfy the equation \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} y_{1} &amp; =mx_{1}+c. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now subtract \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =mx+c-\\left(mx_{1}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =mx-mx_{1}+c-c\\\\ &amp; =m\\left(x-x_{1}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =m(x-x_{1}) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient and (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) is a point on the line. This is called point-slope form because it assumes you know  A point on the line \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and The gradient \\(m\\) of the line.    Some Properties of Linear Graphs  A line that slopes up and to the right has a positive gradient. A line that slopes up and to the left has a negative gradient. Parallel lines have the same gradient. The gradients of two mutually perpendicular lines multiply to \\(-1.\\) A line parallel to the x \u2013 axis has a gradient of \\(0\\). A line parallel to the y \u2013 axis; the gradient is undefined.    Examples  Example 1: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line below:  Solution: First note that the graph has a positive gradient.3 Because it slopes up (increases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a negative gradient, you know something has gone wrong. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(3,7\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7-3}{3-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] So the gradient \\(m=2.\\) From the graph we see the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(1.\\) That is, \\(c=1.\\) Now we can substitute in the equation for a line4 The equation for a line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. \\end{align*}\\] to get \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x+1. \\end{align*}\\] The equation for the line is \\(y=2x+1.\\)   Example 2: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line below:  Solution: First note that the graph has a negative gradient.5 Because it slopes down (decreases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a positive gradient, you know something has gone wrong. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-4}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,4\\right)\\) and so \\(c=4.\\) Hence the equation of the line is \\(y=-\\frac{2}{3}x+4.\\) This is a correct answer but the fraction makes it look a bit ugly. We can multiply both sides by \\(3\\) to get rid of the fraction. The equation then becomes: \\(3y=-2x+12\\) or \\(3y+2x=12.\\)   Example 3: Sketch the function \\(2y=x-6\\) and state the gradient of the straight line. Solution: First find the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept, set \\(y=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =x-6\\\\ \\text{and }x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(6,0\\right)\\). For the \\(y\\)-intercept, set \\(x=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =-6\\\\ \\text{and }y &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,-3\\right).\\) Now draw a line between these two points as shown below:  To find the gradient, let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-\\left(-3\\right)}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, to find the gradient divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =x-6\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x-3. \\end{align*}\\] This is in the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) and we see that the gradient \\(m=1\/2\\) as before.   Example 4: Sketch the graph of \\(3y+2x=0\\) and state the gradient of the straight line. Solution: First find the intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept \\(y=0\\). Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) For the \\(y\\)-intercept, \\(x=0.\\) Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) But this means the \\(x\\)-intercept is equal to the \\(y\\)-intercept. This is because the line passes through the origin \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\).6 We could have seen this by considering the equation of the line: \\(3y+2x=0.\\) Rearranging the equation and dividing by \\(3\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-2x\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x. \\end{align*}\\] Comparing this to the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) we see that \\(m=-2\/3\\) and \\(c=0.\\) That is the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) So far we know the graph goes through \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) To sketch its graph we need another point. To find another point on the line, pick any value of \\(x\\) (other than \\(0\\)). Let\u2019s take \\(x=3\\) then substituting into the equation we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2\\left(3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-6\\\\ y &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] so the point \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) is on the graph. To sketch the graph, we plot the points \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) and draw a line through them as shown below.  To find the gradient, rearrange the equation to the form of \\(y=mx+c\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x \\end{align*}\\] The gradient of the line is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\).   Example 5: Find the equation of the line that passes through the points \\(\\left(-1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2,0\\right)\\). Solution: First find the gradient \\(m.\\) Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(2,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-3}{2-\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{3}\\\\ &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The equation to our line is \\(y=-x+c\\). We need to find \\(c.\\) To find \\(c\\) substitute either of the points on the line into the equation for the line. Using the point \\(\\left(-1,3\\right)\\) we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-x+c\\\\ 3 &amp; =-\\left(-1\\right)+c\\\\ c &amp; =3-1\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] The equation to the line is \\(y=-x+2\\).   Example 6: Find the equation of the line that passes through the point \\(\\left(3,4\\right)\\) and parallel to the line \\(y=-2x+7.\\) Give your answer in point slope form. Solution: The point-slope form of the equation to a straight line is \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =m\\left(x-x_{1}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] The gradient of the line \\(y=-2x+7\\) is \\(-2\\), so \\(m=-2\\). The point on the line is (\\(3,4\\)) so \\(x_{1}=3\\) and \\(y_{1}=4\\). Substituting in the point slope equation gives: \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =m\\left(x-x_{1}\\right)\\\\ y-4 &amp; =-2\\left(x-3\\right). \\end{align*}\\] The equation to the line is \\(y-4=-2(x-3)\\).   See Exercise 3      Exercise 1 Sketch the graphs of the following equations. \\[\\begin{array}{lllllllclc} \\textrm{(a)} &amp; y=4x+3 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(b)} &amp; 2y=-x+6 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(c)} &amp; 3y+2x=9\\\\ \\textrm{(d)} &amp; y=2x &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(e)} &amp; y=7 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(f)} &amp; 2y+x=0 \\end{array}\\]    Exercise 2 Find the gradient of the following straight lines. \\[\\begin{array}{lllllllclc} \\textrm{(a)} &amp; y=-5x &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(b)} &amp; 2y=6x+9 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(c)} &amp; 2x-3y=0\\\\ \\textrm{(d)} &amp; 3y+2x-2=0 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(e)} &amp; 5y=8 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\textrm{(f)} &amp; x=-2 \\end{array}\\]    Exercise 3 Find the equation of the straight lines below          Find the equation, in slope-point form, of the line with a gradient of \\(3\\), passing through the point (\\(0,-5\\)).

However, it is sometimes useful to define angles in terms of the length around the unit circle (a circle of radius = 1). This module introduces radians as a measure of angle.   Definition of the Radian Though angles have commonly been measured in degrees they may also be measured in units known as radians. One radian is the angle created by bending the radius length around the arc of a circle. Consider the circle centred at the origin below. The red arc is the same length as the radius of the circle. The angle subtended at the origin \\(\\theta\\), is one radian and is denoted by \\(1^{c}\\).  One radian is approximately \\(57.3^{\\circ}.\\)   Converting Between Radians and Degrees Because the circumference of a unit circle is given by the formula \\(C=2\\pi r\\), we know \\(2\\pi\\) radians (\\(2\\pi^{c}\\)) is a complete rotation and the same as 360 degrees. Similarly half a rotation or 180 degrees = \\(\\pi\\) radians (\\(180^{\\circ}=\\pi^{c}\\)). Angles that represent fractional parts of a circle can be expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\).

Let's work on some essential skills in manipulating formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSome of the most important equations that we might be required to transpose occur frequently in science, engineering and economics. They are called formulae and give a general rule describing the relationship between variable quantities\r\n\r\nHere are some examples: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} A= &amp; \\pi r^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} s &amp; =ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} S= &amp; P(1+i)^{n} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn these examples \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are, respectively, the subjects of the formulae.1 \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are called subjects because they are on the left hand side of the formula and followed by an equal sign. Sometimes a formula is given in a particular form and it is necessary to rearrange the formula to make a different variable the subject:\r\n\r\nWe know the area of a circle \\(A=\\pi r^{2}\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius and so we can calculate \\(A\\) for any value of \\(r\\). What if we know the area \\(A\\) and have to calculate the radius \\(r\\)?2 We need \\(r\\) to be the subject rather than \\(A\\).\r\n\r\nWe know \\(s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\\) but what if we know \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) and want to calculate \\(a\\)?3 We need \\(a\\) to be the subject rather than \\(s\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging equations and formulas, whatever you do on one side of the equal sign, you must do on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A+B=C\\).\r\nSolution:4 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being added to \\(A\\) on the left side so we subtract \\(B\\) from the left side to get rid of the \\(B\\) terms on the left. Our rule says we must subtract the \\(B\\) from the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =C\\\\ A+B-B &amp; =C-B\\quad\\textrm{subtracting $B$ from both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C-B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A-B=C\\).\r\nSolution:5 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being subtracted from \\(A\\) on the left side so we add \\(B\\) to the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must add B to the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A-B &amp; =C\\\\ A-B+B &amp; =C+B\\quad\\textrm{adding $B$ to both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C+B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(AB=C\\).\r\nSolution:6 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is multiplying \\(A\\) on the left side so we divide by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must divide by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{dividing both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(\\frac{A}{B}=C\\).\r\nSolution:7 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is dividing \\(A\\) on the left side so we multiply by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must multiply by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{B} &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject of the formula \\(A^{2}=B\\).\r\nSolution:8 This case involves \\(A^{2}\\). The inverse (opposite) operation to squaring is the square root. So to get A on its own we need to take the square root of both sides.  \\[\\begin{align*} A^{2} &amp; =B\\\\ \\sqrt{A^{2}} &amp; =\\sqrt{B}\\quad\\textrm{taking the square root of both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =\\sqrt{B}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake A the subject of the formula \\(\\sqrt{A}=B\\).\r\nSolution:9 This case involves \\(\\sqrt{A}\\).

It would suit any student studying at a certificate, diploma or degree level and is designed to help with developing essay and report preparation and writing skills. Introduction: Analysing an argument in a text The very first thing to do when beginning an analysis is to put away your biases (at least as much as you can). It doesn't really matter what you think about the issue or the argument; in fact, you may disagree entirely, or may agree entirely with the argument. You should put that aside. When all you can think about is your own perspective on an argument, you blind yourself to the actual argument before you. The second thing you need to do when beginning an analysis is to actually observe what is on the page. In analysing an argument in a text, the reader looks for the key argument. This argument may be at the beginning or even towards the end. In many cases, the article is a response to an argument put forward by someone else. The writer of the article you are reading may be making counterclaims to rebut the first writer's argument.   Knowing about the writer can help your analysis. Ask questions, such as, what is the writer's purpose, allegiances (political or professional) industry? ? In the sample analysis of the article 'Universal basic income ignores the value of work', the writer is author Emma Dawson from Per Capita. This is a left wing think tank that claims to \"fight inequality in Australia\". Showing at least two sides to an argument demonstrates that the writer has considered different views. They may still favour one side and rebut certain views with counter-arguments. A writer will further strengthen their counter-arguments by giving evidence with referenced citations.

What do we need to look for when we start reading for an assignment? Read 'Universal basic income ignores the value of work' by Emma Dawson. What is the argument? An argument is the position or claim that the writer is putting forward. &nbsp;An argument can be recognised via language, evidence, and text comparisons. An argument will assume an audience's awareness of the topic and also consider their assumptions, prior knowledge and interest. See also Critical reading skills Identifying the bias Bias can be recognised via language, sentence structure, evidence used (including quality of evidence) for supporting claims, lack of evidence for refuting claims, repetition of themes and language. Example of bias: 'The UBI is perhaps the most widely supported idea in fashion on the progressive side of the political debate, so it's no surprise to see the Greens jump on board' (Dawson 2018:18). Who is the audience? The audience is the assumed readership that the author wants to persuade or influence. How does the author influence the audience? Selected vocabulary (which could include colloquial or slang words), language techniques and sentence construction are used to appeal to a particular audience. Arguments are carefully considered to ensure they are convincing to the target audience. Critically analyse: Identify claims, evidence, assumptions Critical analysis starts with these questions:  What is\/are the overall claim\/s of the author? Is the claim backed up by credible evidence? Is the claim based on assumptions?  What is the evidence? Evidence includes information or data from elsewhere to support the claims the writer makes, or refute the claims made by others. Evidence can be judged for quality by the credibility of their origins. Evidence needs to come from a source that has authority and is up-to-date and objective. Is the evidence credible? Credible evidence comes from sources that readers can believe are factual and valid, based on the sources: To understand if evidence is credible, the key things to look for are:  author (who does the author work for\/write for? What other publications have they been involved in? What is their area and level of expertise in the topic?) date (is the information current, given the topic?) source (is the publication source well known or respected in the industry? Peer reviewed? Relevant to the topic?)  See also Critical Thinking: Evaluate the evidence","excerpt":"nodeID: 1269 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: This page will take you through the key steps of analysing an argument.

How do you know which one to choose?\n\nThe Subject Guides have been written by librarians to help you select the most relevant databases for your topic.\n\nIf you know the name of the database you want, you can find it using the Database A-Z list from LibrarySearch.\n\nSearching databases\n\nMost databases offer both a basic and an advanced search option. If you need help searching a particular database, look for the Help menu in the database to find tips and 'How to' videos. You may also find database tutorials on YouTube, and from some Library Subject Guides.\n\nFor an advanced database search, you may need to use Boolean operators. Boolean operators connect your search terms together in specific ways (AND, OR, NOT), and also help you to narrow or broaden your search.\n\nActivity: Boolean operators\nLearn more about Boolean operators and how to use them by completing this activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean operators\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to combine keywords using Boolean operators (advanced operators).\n\nSelect an operator to view the search results.\n\nANDORNOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncation and wildcards\nSome databases and catalogues also allow you to use truncation and wildcard symbols. \n\nSelect a symbol to view the result.\n\n*?\nbehaviour* =\nbehavioural, behaviours, behaviour. \norgani?ational behavio?r =\norganisational, organizational, behaviour, behavior. \n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for a phrase\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to search for phrases. \n\nSelect the symbol to view the result.\n\n\"\"\n\"organisational behaviour\" =\nresults with the exact words, \"organisational behaviour\" \n\n\n\nPreviousNext\n\n\n\n\nBoolean operators\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to combine keywords using Boolean operators (advanced operators).\n\n \tAND operator:\n\"Travel AND Tourism\" - Travel AND Tourism retrieves records with both travel and tourism (indicated by the shaded area) and narrows the number of records retrieved.\n \tOR operator:\n\"Travel OR Tourism\" - Travel OR Tourism retrieves records where either travel or tourism occur (indicated by the shaded area) and broadens the number of records retrieved.\n \tNOT operator:\n\"Travel NOT Tourism\" - Travel NOT Tourism retrieves records with the keyword \"travel\" but not \"tourism\" (indicated by the shaded area).\n\nTruncation and wildcards\nSome databases and catalogues also allow you to use truncation and wildcard symbols.\n\n \tTruncation\nbehaviour* = behavioural, behaviours, behaviour.\nYou can use truncation to broaden your search by substituting a word ending with a symbol. In this example, we use an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\n \tWildcards\norgani?ational behavio?r = organisational, organizational, behaviour, behavior.\nYou can use wildcards to broaden your search by substituting letters in words. In this example, we have used a question mark (?) as the wildcard symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you will need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\n\nSearching for a phrase\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to search for phrases. Quotation marks placed at the beginning and end of a phrase narrows a search. Only results that include the exact phrase will appear.\n\n \t\"organisational behaviour\" = results with the exact words, \"organisational behaviour\"\n\n\n\n jQuery(document).ready(function() { let currSection = 'first'; const booleanOperators = [ { title: 'Travel AND Tourism', desc: 'Travel AND Tourism retrieves records with both travel and \\ tourism (indicated by the shaded area) and narrows the number of \\ records retrieved.', }, { title: 'Travel OR Tourism', desc: 'Travel OR Tourism retrieves records where either travel or \\ tourism occur (indicated by the shaded area) and broadens the \\ number of records retrieved.', }, { title: 'Travel NOT Tourism', desc: 'Travel NOT Tourism retrieves records with the keyword \\ \"travel\" but not \"tourism\" (indicated by the shaded area).', }, ]; const truncationAndWildcards = [ { title: 'Truncation', desc: 'You can use truncation to broaden your search by substituting \\ a word ending with a symbol.

Click on the 'Check answers' button when you are finished.\n\n\n\nScenario 1\nYou are studying for a small business qualification. Your task is to choose a small business idea and to identify and analyse potential competitors. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\n\n\n \t The website of an existing business that could be a potential competitor.\nFeedback: Well done. This is the best option. Websites are useful sources for this research task because they often contain details about potential competitors including price, product range, target market and annual reports.\n \t Advertisement in trade magazine for similar business.\nFeedback: Although an advertisement can help identify competitors, you cannot analyse them. A competitor's website is a better option because it often contains details about price, product range, target market and annual reports to assist in analysis.\n \t Bureau of Statistics report that cites the number of new small businesses that commenced in the previous financial year.\nFeedback: The Bureau of Statistics is a reputable source of information but, in this case, the information is not specific or relevant to the research topic.\n \t An article in a popular magazine about how someone else started up their own small business.\nFeedback: Articles in popular magazines can be appropriate sources of information. This particular article is too general and may provide useful background but will not assist in identifying and analysing competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 2\nYou are researching emerging architectural trends in apartment living in capital cities worldwide. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\n\n\n \t Plans of current apartment developments being undertaken in your city.\nFeedback: Although plans of current local developments could be useful, the topic's focus is worldwide so it would need to be supplemented by examples in other cities. Plans of current developments may also not be indicative of emerging trends.\n \t International trade show for the building construction sector \u2013 keynote address, \"Life in 2030.\"\nFeedback: This source relates to future trends. The topic is focussed on emerging trends. Otherwise, this may have been an appropriate resource.\n \t Photographs of apartment complexes captured during a field trip around your city.\nFeedback: Although photographs of current local developments could be useful, the topic's focus is worldwide so it would need to be supplemented by examples in other cities. Photographs of current developments may also not be indicative of emerging trends.\n \t Online magazine article, \"What does going green really mean? Global impacts of sustainability on residential design.\"\nFeedback: Correct! This is the best option because it best suits the criteria of the research topic.\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 3\nYou are researching the evolution of special effects in the film industry. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\n\n\n \t Movie review from a well-respected film critic.\nFeedback: A movie review is subjective and not relevant to this topic.\n \t Transcript of a radio interview with Richard Rickitt, author of Special Effects, and Tyruben Ellingson, who worked on Avatar, who discuss the evolution of special effects in films.\nFeedback: Well done! This is the best option. The sources used for the radio interview appear to be qualified and the assignment topic is directly addressed.\n \t A blog where contributors talk about their favourite special effects movies of all time.\nFeedback: Blogs can be acceptable sources of information but are only appropriate when the contributors are qualified. In this case the entries are subjective and irrelevant.\n \t A report published in a trade magazine, Beyond 3D \u2013 the future of special effects in the film industry, completed by a team from a respected university.\nFeedback: This report, although published by a reputable source, refers to the future of special effects, not the evolution.\n\n\nCheck answers Show answers Clear\n\n[\/tab] [\/tabs]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if I can't just use Google and Wikipedia for my research, what can I use?\nMany lecturers require students to use scholarly or peer-reviewed journal articles for assignments.

You can also use the Ask the Library service.\n\nActivity: Which information source is best?\nIdentify the best information source in the scenarios below.\n\n\nScenario 1\nYou are studying for a small business qualification. Your task is to choose a small business idea and to identify and analyse potential competitors. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\nOptions:\n\n \tThe website of an existing business that could be a potential competitor.\n \tAdvertisement in trade magazine for similar business.\n \tBureau of Statistics report that cites the number of new small businesses that commenced in the previous financial year.\n \tAn article in a popular magazine about how someone else started up their own small business.\n\n\nScneario 2\nYou are researching emerging architectural trends in apartment living in capital cities worldwide. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\nOptions:\n\n \tPlans of current apartment developments being undertaken in your city.\n \tInternational trade show for the building construction sector \u2013 keynote address, \"Life in 2030.\"\n \tPhotographs of apartment complexes captured during a field trip around your city.\n \tOnline magazine article, \"What does going green really mean? Global impacts of sustainability on residential design.\"\n\n\nScenario 3\nYou are researching the evolution of special effects in the film industry. Choose the most appropriate information source from the list.\n\nOptions:\n\n \tMovie review from a well-respected film critic.\n \tTranscript of a radio interview with Richard Rickitt, author of Special Effects, and Tyruben Ellingson, who worked on Avatar, who discuss the evolution of special effects in films.\n \tA blog where contributors talk about their favourite special effects movies of all time.\n \tA report published in a trade magazine, Beyond 3D \u2013 the future of special effects in the film industry, completed by a team from a respected university.\n\n\nAnswers\n\n \tScenario 1: (a)\nFeedback: Well done. This is the best option. Websites are useful sources for this research task because they often contain details about potential competitors including price, product range, target market and annual reports.\n \tScenario 2: (d)\nFeedback: Correct! This is the best option because it best suits the criteria of the research topic.\n \tScenario 3: (b)\nFeedback: Well done! This is the best option. The sources used for the radio interview appear to be qualified and the assignment topic is directly addressed.\n\n\n\n  jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('.feedback').each(function() { jQuery(this).hide(); }); \/\/ Check answers jQuery('#check-answers-btn').on('click', function() { const tick = ''; const cross = ''; jQuery('.scenario-form input:checked').each(function() { \/\/ Colourise the list item dependent on its correctness \/\/ Append a tick or cross if (jQuery(this).hasClass('answer')) { jQuery(this).parent().find('.icon').empty(); jQuery(this).parent().find('.icon').append(tick); jQuery(this).parent().find('.feedback').addClass('green-border'); } else { jQuery(this).parent().find('.icon').empty(); jQuery(this).parent().find('.icon').append(cross); jQuery(this).parent().find('.feedback').addClass('red-border'); } \/\/ Display feedback jQuery(this).parent().find('.feedback').slideDown(); }); }); \/\/ Show answers jQuery('#show-answers-btn').on('click', function() { jQuery('.scenario-form input').each(function() { if (jQuery(this).hasClass('answer')) { jQuery(this).parent().addClass('highlight'); } }) }) \/\/ Clear answers jQuery('#clear-btn').on('click', function() { jQuery('.scenario-form input').each(function() { jQuery(this).parent().removeClass('correct incorrect highlight'); jQuery(this).prop('checked', false); }); \/\/ Hide feedback and remove styles jQuery('.feedback').removeClass('green-border red-border').slideUp(); \/\/ Clear ticks and crosses jQuery('.icon').each(function() { jQuery(this).children().remove(); }); }); \/\/ Remove highlight if user selects another answer jQuery('.scenario-form').on('click', function() { jQuery(this).find('.feedback').slideUp(); jQuery('li').each(function() { jQuery(this).removeClass('correct incorrect highlight'); }); jQuery(this).find('.icon').children().remove(); }); }); ","excerpt":"So, if I can't just use Google and Wikipedia for my research, then what can I use? [tabs type=\"tabs\"] [tab title=\"Scholarly information\" active=\"true\"] Many lecturers require students to use scholarly or peer-reviewed journal articles for assignments. As a smart researcher, you need to be able to tell whether an article is scholarly. Scholarly articles are in-depth, accurate, well-researched, written by academics and published in academic journals. They are good and credible sources of information because the articles have been through a peer-review process. This means the article has been formally evaluated by equally qualified academics and experts.

Students usually use search engines like Google to find information about an assignment topic, but finding useful resources among many pages of search results can be challenging.\n\nGoogle and other search engines are easy to search, but they produce a large number of results and many that are not relevant to the topic.\n\nFortunately, you can conduct a much more efficient search and save yourself lots of time and effort by using a few simple search commands. Try  Lifehack's 20 Tips to use Google Search efficiently.\n\nGoogle is a good place to find background or general information, but you need to be aware of its limitations for academic research.\nWhy can't I just Google it?\nWatch this short video explaining the advantages and disadvantages of Google.\nUsing Wikipedia for academic research\nWhen you do a Google search about a topic you will most likely find Wikipedia listings at the top of your search results. Take a look at this infographic on Using Wikipedia for academic research to find out more about Wikipedia's benefits and limitations.\n\n\nGoogle Scholar\nAnother way to search the web more effectively is to use Google Scholar as your search engine. Google Scholar is a simple way to search for scholarly literature in articles, theses, books, abstracts and other formats.\n\nIf you access Google Scholar from the RMIT Library website using your RMIT login, your search results will link you back to the full text resources held by the Library. Go to the Library Google Scholar page for more information.\n\nFor more help on using Google Scholar for research go to Google Scholar search tips or find a video on YouTube.\n\n","excerpt":"Finding the right information for your assignment topic may seem daunting at first.

Read the resources on this page to get introduced to this powerful tool in maths.   DE1 First order separable What is a first order separable differential equation? A first order variables separable differential equation is one in which the variables (represented by pronumerals or letters) can be separated into either side of the equation (i.e. the = sign).   DE2 First order linear What is a first order linear unseparable differential equation? If a differential equation is unseparable, this means the variables (represented by pronumerals or letters) cannot be isolated. That means you cannot reorganise the formula so that the wanted variable is on one side of the equation alone. You will need to resort to other numerical or analytical methods to solve these differential equations. Read this sheet to find out how.   DE3 Second order homogeneous What is a second order homogenous differential equation? A second order homogenous differential equation is an expression that includes a function of a variable (say y), its derivative (y\u2019) and a second derivative (y\u2019\u2019) and this expression is equal to zero. Read this sheet to find out how to solve these.   DE4 Second order non-homogeneous What is a second order non-homogenous differential equation? A second order non homogenous DE is an expression that includes a function of a variable (say y), its derivative (y\u2019) and a second derivative (y\u2019\u2019), but this time the expression is NOT equal to zero.

Follow the TEEL strategy when writing paragraphs. Make sure each paragraph contains one main idea, which you express in a topic sentence. This is usually the first sentence of the paragraph. The topic sentences develop the argument (thesis) of the essay. Expand on the topic sentence in the rest of the paragraph. Add sentences that:  explain or elaborate on the topic sentence provide evidence (with references) or examples to support the topic sentence.  In the final sentence, link back to the main idea in the topic sentence. You may link to the following paragraph if it is a closely related idea This creates cohesion and logical development. The hamburger metaphor represents how to write a paragraph using TEEL.  By reading the topic sentences only, you should be able to see the development of the argument.   Activity Select the buttons to explore the TEEL structure within the paragraph. Notice how references have been used throughout the paragraph to support the claims. One factor that impacts positively on team effectiveness is the notion of team cohesiveness. Team cohesiveness is the key to enabling a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals. Mathieu et al. (2014) note that the right mix of people sets the stage for a team to be effective, resulting in improved performance quality and innovation. BJB Minerals' project teams were established on an opt-in basis based on the idealistic model, where members were encouraged by the clear goals and knowledge of the skill sets needed (Berlin et al. 2012). The project assigned to the team was also well resourced, with clear timelines and an end date (BJB Minerals 2014).  This idealistic team model validated the diverse skills that individuals brought to the team, celebrating both personal satisfaction as well as the team's project achievements.

She said it would be judged in terms of strength, height, and how aesthetically pleasing it was. My group and I did the task cooperatively and we finished it in the prescribed time. We thought we had done very well. Then Dr Strangelove made her point: all groups built the tower without much attention to project management techniques in terms of asking clients for clarification for planning, resources allocation, etc. None of us had asked a single question about the purpose, constraints, resources or stakeholder needs. The group displayed what she describes as \u2018groupthink\u2019. I was amused and embarrassed but I learned a lesson about project management.2Screen reader users, this is the describe section.\r\n    \r\n        1 The insight\r\n         2 Describe  \r\n    \r\n    Understanding the importance of clarification is central to my understanding of project management. It underpins my use of PM tools and techniques. Asking clarifying questions about types of work resources (people and equipment) and material resources (supplies, stock, and other consumable resources) allows me to identify what resources are needed for project effectiveness. When we want to designate who or what is accountable for accomplishing tasks in our project schedule I can use PM tools to assign tasks and responsibilities \u2026 All this is possible only if requirements are clarified through questions.3Screen reader users, this is the interpret section.\r\n    3 Interpret\r\n    A major benefit of understanding the critical role of questioning in project management is that it might give me more confidence about asking questions. It changes my view of questioning government authorities. In my job as a project manager in the reserve bank in Phnom Penh I traditionally would not feel able to question my superiors in these projects. I would try to establish the requirements and resources in some other way. I thought I could avoid asking questions by transferring lessons learned from one situation to another. I could do this by using a framework as a predictive aid to resourcing (Crawford and Pollack, 2004)\u2026 But now I feel I am required by my position to determine the dimensions and resources of a project. Knowing the role of questioning to achieve objective clarity for a specific purpose is very valuable for me to give me confidence in my position as a project manager in government projects.4Screen reader users, this is the evaluate section.\r\n    4 Evaluate\r\n    I believe this new realisation will be useful throughout my degree and in my future professional and private life. In my degree studies, I will endeavour to clarify the critical aspects of project planning by using a questioning technique that allows for understanding objective dimensions, and also any subjective aspects. In my practice as a project manager in Cambodia I will use questioning to clarify the project goals and objectives with all stakeholders. In my life I will question my own assumptions about what is expected of me before I jump in (and build any more towers).5Screen reader users, this is the plan section\r\n    5 Plan\r\n","excerpt":"A reflective blog: an academic reflection in four paragraphs (from Master of Project Management) From an activity in this week\u2019s lecture I learned that the best place to start resource planning is with questioning to clarify the client needs and to enable the work breakdown structure (WBS).1Screen reader users, this is the insight.The guest lecturer in Project Management Techniques, Dr Strangelove, started her presentation by asking us to assemble as a group of five and then build a tower from straws.

Answer: A. poor referencing technique Feedback: Not plagiarism. Leaving out extra references is not plagiarism, but listing multiple references where possible makes that claim stronger because it is widely accepted.   Situation 2: Two students work together finding sources and discuss an assignment that they must submit individually. There is great similarity in their arguments and citations. Answer: B. unintentional plagiarism Unintentional plagiarism. The claims\/ideas that the student included in his assignment are (in part) inspired or sourced from his friend. Working together on individual assignments leads to accidental plagiarism like this. You need to keep careful record of any ideas that belong to another student and cite them (as personal communications). These students should also find more references between the two of them to make their reference lists different as well.   Situation 3: A student bases their essay around an essay that their friend submitted for that subject the previous year. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism. This is representing the work of another person as your own. The fact that the submissions are separated in time makes no difference.   Situation 4: A student copies large amounts of text because they find it too difficult to change the language. They cite the author and the date. Answer: B. unintentional plagiarism Unintentional plagiarism. If you use the exact wording of a text, you must enclose those words in quotation marks and include the page or paragraph number in the citation. Otherwise, it appears that you have crafted those words. The student needs to develop some paraphrasing strategies.   Situation 5: Several citations are placed at the end of the paragraph so it is very difficult to decide what information is sourced from which article. Answer: A. poor referencing technique Not plagiarism. Listing all references at the end of a paragraph is not blatant plagiarism but it is not up to academic standard. The information needs to be easily traced to its original source and therefore the citation should be placed as close to the information as possible.   Situation 6: A student uses large sections of another essay that they previously wrote and submitted for a related subject at another university. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Plagiarism. You need to cite ideas or text as a reference if it is from work that has already been submitted for academic credit. This is so, even if you wrote it yourself! Any essay that has been submitted previously is recorded in Turnitin.   Situation 7: John uses an essay that his friend bought online last year but the friend did not submit it because he discontinued his course. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism.

For more information on paraphrasing, visit Paraphrasing.  Paraphrasing activity Read the original text, then select the best paraphrase out of the two options below.   Original text The challenge of both measuring and managing diverse cultural factors within the same national culture cannot be underestimated. However, the task of deciphering both national and organizational differences of firms engaging in joint ventures across national boundaries is even more perplexing. From Palthe, J 2014, \u2018Cross-Level Cultural Congruence: Implications for managing diversity in multinational corporations\u2019, Journal of Diversity Management, vol.9, no.1, pp. 51-61.   Paraphrase 1  The difficulty of calculating and managing the diversity of cultural elements in one country is great. When companies from different countries work together, it is more difficult (Palthe 2014).    This paraphrase is actually a word switch. The words of the original have been replaced by synonyms. For example \"The challenge\" has been replaced by \"The difficulty\" and \"cannot be underestimated\" has been replaced by \"is great\". The order of the word replacements also stays the same.     Paraphrase 2  Working with staff from two or more countries further multiplies the complexity of managing diverse cultures (Palthe 2014).    This paraphrase has reordered the structure and the words significantly from the original. This is the better paraphrase.

Ask the Library         Reading and note-taking Uni assignments require a lot of reading. You not only need to become an efficient reader but also a critical reader. You will also need to make notes of the information relevant to your assessment. Your notes should summarise the key points and record important bibliographical details like the author's name, the title of the source, the publisher, year of publication and page numbers. If you are referring to a website, make sure you record the url and the date that you accessed the page.   These details are important for referencing, and it is far better to collate this information as you are taking notes instead of attempting to track down references later. You may be in breach of academic integrity if you aren't able to show where you gathered the information from and passing off ideas that aren't your own. Therefore, when planning for your assignments, you should consider academic integrity to save yourself the hassle later!

The question is usually very specific and will refer to only part of the course content. There are three common types of words to look out for.\nContent words\nContent words identify concepts or ideas from your course that apply to the topic. To properly understand content words it is often necessary to do some research on the topic first. Think about the following:\n\n \tWhich part of the course content does the question refer to?\n \tWhich aspects of the topic are required?\n \tWhat broader context is this question part of?\n\nInstructional words\nA clear understanding of instructional words is vital for answering the question the way the lecturer expects. In an assignment, the lecturer is not only assessing what you know, but also your ability to respond to the content in a particular way. Assignments may require you to:\n\n \tDescribe or give information about a topic or idea\n \tShow or explain the relationship between topics or ideas\n \tDescribe or explain a process\n \tArgue a point of view\n \tCompare different ideas\n\nand so on.\n\nView the meanings of instructional words list\nLimiting words\nLimiting words narrow down the topic.

Try this short quiz to test your understanding of some of the myths about plagiarism and academic integrity.       Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the following questions. An explanation is provided for each question.  Question 1 If I'm caught plagiarising, a big red \"P\" will appear on my academic transcript.  Answer: No.  Feedback: This is not true. However, being caught plagiarising can lead to possible penalties beginning with a warning, through to expulsion from RMIT. It's not worth it.   Question 2 I'm really worried about my grades and I'm buying a good online essay. Could I get caught?  Answer: Yes.  Feedback: Online essays are not written in your writing style so it's easy to detect. If you need help with your assessments, visit the Study and Learning Centre.   Question 3 If I use parts of an essay that I wrote last year, it's not plagiarism - it's good time management.  Answer: No.  Feedback: Sure, you're being resourceful, however, this is called self-plagiarism. You must reference all sources, including yourself!   Question 4 Paraphrasing is easy, you just need to change the words, don't you?  Answer: No.  Feedback: This is still plagiarism! It's known as inadequate paraphrasing. Even if you cite your source, you need to change the words and the structure of the original text. In other words, write it in your own words.   Question 5 Another student in my class is struggling with an essay task. He asked me to send him my essay to help him with ideas. Is this OK?  Answer: No.  Feedback: This is known as collusion, which is a form of plagiarism. Allowing others to copy your work makes you as guilty of plagiarism as the person doing the copying. You may even face the same penalties.   Question 6 Is it plagiarism to copy out big chunks of text, as long as I put them in quotation marks and say where it's from?  Answer: No.  Feedback: It's not plagiarism, however, it's not good practice. Use direct quotes sparingly. Paraphrasing is a better technique to integrate evidence into your writing.   Question 7 Even if my essay passes the plagiarism detector (Turnitin), can my lecturer still claim I plagiarised?  Answer: Yes.  Feedback: Plagiarism software such as Turnitin only checks duplication. There will still be a human reading your work, not just a computer!

The three reading strategies to use are:  Skimming: To gain a general idea of the content and structure of the case Scanning: To pick up important key words, linking words, names and numbers (including dates) Deep reading: Slow and careful reading with a critical (questioning) approach   Step 1: Skimming and scanning  Do not stop to make notes. The purpose is to understand the larger concepts, overall structure and scan for keywords, names and dates. When you have finished, ask yourself the following questions:   What is the case about? What issues can I see now? Does anything immediately connect to my course notes?  Step 2: Detailed reading  Re-read the case again, more slowly and carefully, for a deeper understanding. Some questions you could ask are:   What critical events are important? When and why did they happen? Who are the people involved and who is responsible?  What are the key problems? What evidence from the case shows this? What are the constraints or obstacles to potential solutions? What do I need to research?   For more information, see the Reading skills resources.  Step 3: Annotation\/note-taking Now, begin to annotate the case and continue to ask yourself questions as you read. Highlight, underline and circle text, and add names, labels and comments to:  identify important points and supporting points (examples, reasons, statistics) draw connections between ideas mark important definitions and terminology identify any points that need clarification  See the examples below.

For more information about using the library search tools and study guides, go to Getting started with the Library.  The next step is to link the identified problems to theory. Integrating theory into your case study answer is vital. This allows you to:  establish how theory relates to the actual issues\/problems demonstrate your understanding of your course content.  How to map case evidence to relevant theory Use a simple strategy such as a table to organise evidence from the case and link it to the broader problem or issue the evidence describes. This will help you target your research to relevant theory, models or practice which are directly linked to your case evidence. Your research will also help you select appropriate solutions to the problems that you first identified. The example below uses information from a management case study.    Evidence Problem Relevant theory Solution   CEO  Office location on top floor 'mythical figure' Focussed on results HealthCo is 'his baby'   CEO leadership style  'autocratic'     Weber (Bureaucratic management) (Houghton 2010) Taylor (Scientific theory of management) (Van Vugt et al. 2004         No respect for staff ('only a number) No rewards ... only punishment ('super snoops') No initiative allowed  staff leaving     Management culture  'distrustful' controlling     Mechanistic Autocratic leadership style (Bass &amp; Bass 2008)         Communication 'top down'   Communication  memos only     Impersonal communication style (De Hoog et al. 2015)           Activity: Example case study The example from the Management case study below shows how the student has identified an issue based on actual examples from the case.

Click on the buttons to explore each part of the case study.       2. Discussion 2.1 Identification of issues and problems A major problem for HealthCo is its organisational culture, typified by the CEO's autocratic leadership style. This is demonstrated in HealthCo's management of its frontline staff, which includes standardisation of work methods, enforced cooperation, and the belief that money is the only motivation for employees. This traditional leadership style, based on Taylor's scientific management theory, is characterised by control of decision making and domination (Bass &amp; Bass 2008), and is most often found in organisations with a rigidly defined hierarchy (Van Vugt et al. 2004). Although Taylor believed that control and enforcement are required to ensure the most effective, and efficient, completion of tasks, this management style has been criticised as causing resentment, low morale and lack of innovation in employees (Houghton 2010). These are all issues that have led to the current situation at HealthCo and as a consequence, will limit the company's ability to remain an industry leader. Another issue affecting HealthCo's competitive advantage is poor communication between management and staff. De Hoog et al. (2015) describe how impersonal ...

Always check your assessment criteria.       2.3. Recommendations   2.3.1. Strategies for improving communication at HealthCo    Strategy 1 \u2013 Provide feedback on performance Formalise opportunities to provide feedback on performance for all employees, including management, through regular performance reviews. Baker (2010) states that feedback on performance is vital to the improvement of job performance and forms part of a Human Performance System. This system would need to be implemented by the CEO and should apply across all levels of the HealthCo without exception. More holistic feedback on performance, rather than measuring productivity by 'computer hits' would assure staff that management was supportive and respectful of their skills.   Strategy 2 \u2013 Relocate management and CEO offices Relocate management closer to frontline staff areas and provide spaces for informal staff interactions. The CEO and senior management need to lead the relocation of management offices by moving from their current location which significantly isolates them from the clerical staff. General purpose staff rooms and office relocations should encourage interactions between staff and management. This may allow for  more open communication between upper and lower level staff and end comments that management 'should get out and visit us more' (Mintzberg 2004).

Answer: A. poor referencing technique Feedback: Not plagiarism. Leaving out extra references is not plagiarism, but listing multiple references where possible makes that claim stronger because it is widely accepted.   Situation 2: Two students work together finding sources and discuss an assignment that they must submit individually. There is great similarity in their arguments and citations. Answer: B. unintentional plagiarism Unintentional plagiarism. The claims\/ideas that the students included in their assignments are (in part) inspired or sourced from their friend. Working together on individual assignments leads to accidental plagiarism like this. You need to keep careful record of any ideas that belong to another student and cite them (as personal communications). These students should also find more references between the two of them to make their reference lists different as well.   Situation 3: A student bases their essay around an essay that their friend submitted for that subject the previous year. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism. This is representing the work of another person as your own. The fact that the submissions are separated in time makes no difference.   Situation 4: A student copies large amounts of text because they find it too difficult to change the language. They cite the author and the date but fail to use quotation marks. Answer: A. poor referencing technique Poor referencing technique. You need to cite ideas or text as a reference if it is from work that has already been submitted for academic credit. This is so, even if you wrote it yourself! Any essay that has been submitted previously is recorded in Turnitin.   Situation 5: A student uses an image they found online. The sketch had no name with it so they do not reference it. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Plagiarism. All sourced images need to be referenced. The reference for an image must include the name of the creator of the image (if known) and the place where the image was found, whether that be in a book or on a website. Not referencing an image correctly is plagiarism.   Situation 6: Several citations are placed at the end of the paragraph so it is very difficult to decide what information is sourced from which article. Answer: A. poor referencing technique Plagiarism. You need to cite ideas or text as a reference if it is from work that has already been submitted for academic credit. This is so, even if you wrote it yourself! Any essay that has been submitted previously is recorded in Turnitin.   Situation 7: A student uses large sections of another essay that they previously wrote and submitted for a related subject at another university. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Plagiarism. You need to cite ideas or text as a reference if it is from work that has already been submitted for academic credit. This is so, even if you wrote it yourself! Any essay that has been submitted previously is recorded in Turnitin.   Situation 8: John uses an essay that his friend bought online last year but the friend did not submit it because he discontinued his course. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism.

As Ingram  states, when using a new technology 'a designer's task is to help promote the possibilities that technology can deliver'.

Paragraph: All design stems from something that came before, and attempts to incorporate the new to address new purposes and usually new aesthetics. These historical design elements can be shape, size, purpose or materials, but the key to change in design is increasingly linked to available and emerging technologies. As Ingram [multiple choice 1: A. 2012; B. 2012 p 71; C. 2012:71] states, when using a new technology 'a designer's task is to help promote the possibilities that technology can deliver'. Designers inherently need to push the boundaries and reduce the costs involved in manufacturing, and technology is often the key to meeting these imperatives. The availability of new materials was the catalyst for modernist design, particularly furniture design in Denmark.

Answers: Multiple choice 1: C Feedback: In direct citations, both the date and page number are needed in the in-text references. As the author's name is already mentioned in the sentence, it is not needed in the in-text citation. Multiple choice 2: A Feedback: This is a paraphrase so the page number is not needed. The reference should just contain the author's name (as it is not mentioned in the sentence) and date. Multiple choice 3: B Feedback: As a direct citation in a sentence where the author's name is not mentioned, the in-text reference must have the author's surname date, page number.

In academic writing, paraphrasing helps to avoid plagiarism. Paraphrasing well involves changing the structure of the sentence and not just changing the words. The following video introduces you to the basics of paraphrasing. Although the examples within the video are not specific to art and design students, the basic ideas are still relevant.

Original text Design sketching is quite different from the process of producing a drawing of what you have in front of you. Drawing from the object is a matter of reproducing and interpreting something which exists in the physical world and which you can see. Design sketches, whether on paper or computer, are not drawings of something \u2018out there\u2019, but are the attempts by the designer to give external form to something which is imagined, existing only in the designer\u2019s mind. As such it may be conceived incompletely with hazy details. Garner S and Evans C (eds) (2012) Design and designing: a critical introduction, Bloomsbury Publishing, London.   Paraphrase 1  Design sketching is not the same as creating a drawing of an item that lives in the real word and that you can see. Design sketches, in any form, are efforts by the artist to externalise something which is in the artist\u2019s imagination and therefore it may not be completely clear (Garner and Evans 2012).    This paraphrase is actually a word switch. The words of the original have been replaced by synonyms. For example \"quite different from\" has been replaced by \"not the same as\" and \"the process of producing a drawing\" has been replaced by \"creating a drawing\". The order of the word replacements also stays the same.     Paraphrase 2  The process of \u2018design sketching\u2019 enables the designer to formulate a more concrete, though possibly vague, visualisation of an idea, in contrast to drawing actual objects from observation (Garner and Evans 2012).    This paraphrase has reordered the structure and the words significantly from the original. This is the better paraphrase.

The differences between reports occur chiefly in the body. Reports follow a principle of moving from a problem or issue through to solutions. The structure (headings, sub-headings) needs to be tailored to fit the context (rather than vice versa). Your lecturer may provide a structure by giving headings or questions to answer. Follow the instructions of your teacher first. You need to determine the most logical and efficient way to:  chunk the information order the information label the information using headings or subheadings.  Reports vary in style and purpose but the following sections are common to most reports. The sections described below should be used as a guide and are not prescriptive.    Beginning Title page Abstract or executive summary Table of contents Introduction Middle (body) Method\/methodology Results Discussion End Conclusion Recommendations References Appendices     Beginning Your report should start by setting the context for the body of the report. It is the section where the reader is informed of what they need to know to understand the rest of the report. Title page This includes:  the title of report your name date.  Tip: Microsoft Word can help you generate title pages.   Abstract or executive summary In 5-10% of the total word count, give an overview of the entire report. Identify:  the purpose [1] of the report the methods [2] used to conduct the research the result [3] of the research the conclusions [4] drawn from the research recommendations [5] for future actions.  Sample executive summary  [1] The study is a quantitative investigation of university graduates' awareness of social media [SM] use in the recruitment process. [2] Likert-scaled questionnaires were emailed to randomly selected students approaching the end of their course in three departments of the university. [3] The results showed that most students did not agree with the proposition that various social media platforms were used for screening. [4] This indicates a significant underestimation of how prevalent SM is as a recruitment and screening tool despite the prevalence SM has in the lives of the cohort sample. [5] It was recommended that explicit awareness raising be integrated into Careers &amp; Employment communications and professionally oriented courses.    Table of contents This is a list of the sections of your report. Major and minor sections are identified through headings and subheadings (and possibly sub-sub headings!) Sample table of contents   Introduction  Social media as a social phenomena Recruitment processes in the 21st Century The use of social media in recruitment   The study  Methodology Participants   Findings Discussion  Student awareness of social media as a recruitment tool Students attitudes towards social media in screening and recruitment Potential misrepresentation and discrimination through social media  Tailored profiling Specific interest communities Non users   The graduates awareness gaps about social media and job-seeking   Conclusions Recommendations Appendices     Introduction An introduction can:  set the context and background [1] of the problem, issue or investigation  may include an outline of the sections so that the reader understands the structure provide an hypothesis to be analysed   state the purpose [2] of the report.  Sample introduction  [1] There has been an increase in the use of social media over recent years in the recruitment and job-seeking process with every indication that this practice will continue to expand. Social media has become a tool for potential employers to gather information and evaluate a candidate's suitability for a job. While this practice has become widespread, there is little in the way of systematic approaches to using social media as a recruitment tool. Expectations about social media presence are seldom explicit, and both potential employers and employees need clarity on appropriate use of this information. [2] This report will discuss research into graduating students awareness of social media usage as a recruitment tool for graduate employment.    Middle (body) Organise the sections in a logical sequence based on:  how you investigated the issue or problem (method, methodology, materials, participants, length of study time) what you found through the investigation, (results) what judgements\/ interpretations you have made about the process or the findings (discussion, analysis)  Method\/methodology The method section of a report details how the research was conducted, the research methods used and the reasons for choosing those methods. It should:  outline the participants and research methods used, e.g. surveys\/questionnaire, interviews refer to other relevant studies.  The methodology is a step-by-step explanation of the research process. It should be:  factual mainly written in past tense.  The method section of a scientific\/engineering report provides:  an explanation of the experimental procedures (so that the experiment can be repeated for validation in the future). mainly written in passive tense.  Sample methodology Use the buttons to explore the sample methodology. methodprocedurerelevant studyparticipants  The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009). This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated graduates attitudes and knowledge of the use of social media in recruitment (see Appendix 1). The questionnaire used a 4-point Likert scale to assess awareness (Jones 2007) and attitudes towards social media in recruitment and provided open-ended responses for additional comments. The survey was voluntary and anonymous. A total of 412 questionnaires were distributed online to randomly selected graduating students from each of the three colleges within the university. The completed questionnaires were returned by email.   Results The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:  What happened? What was found?  There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts. Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section. Presenting the data Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to explain or illustrate a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but is supportive, then it can be an appendix to the report but still referred to within the text. Dot points\/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information. Sample results There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.

It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues\/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:  state\/identify the main research findings\/themes interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean link the results to other research.  Identifying the major themes in the results will help structure the discussion. This will keep the report focussed on specific points that have developed from the data or research. This helps to clarify identifiable outcomes which can often be used as headings. Sample discussion Discussion of results [1]. Link to other research [2]. Student analysis\/ comments [3]. [1]This study highlights the lack of awareness amongst graduate job seekers of the use of social media for recruitment. The practice of employers accessing the personal profiles of potential employees is widespread and is not considered to be an ethical issue by employers. [2] As the data (Smith &amp; Watson, 2014) demonstrates, over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% check Facebook and Twitter when considering candidates who have applied for positions. Further, Starr's (2015) research of school leavers indicates that less than 25% are aware of what privacy settings they use on social media and even fewer were aware that these sites may be used for judging people for various reasons (see Appendix 2). [3] Clearly, the job seeking public needs to be made aware that employers are increasingly accessing their personal profiles on social media for recruitment purposes. Educating the public on the consequences of this recruitment practice needs to start early.   End Reports are often about solving problems or exploring issues. The end of the report should give the reader a sense of outcome and future direction after the body. Conclusion This is a summary statement of key findings or outcomes. Have your aims been successful or not? Was your hypothesis proven to be true? A synthesis and interpretation of findings [1] makes them meaningful for the reader. Sample conclusion  [1] Usage of social media in recruitment is widely established and expected to increase as social media becomes further integrated with business and personal lifestyles. Current research has found that over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% engage with Facebook and Twitter when making decisions about the appropriateness of prospective employees. However results show that graduates were sufficiently aware or alarmed by this practice and the potential discriminatory effect on their employment opportunities.    Recommendations A good way to present your recommendations is to list them in bullet points for easy reading. What actions do you suggest, given your conclusions? What questions for further study are raised by this research or investigation? Sample recommendations   There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.   Awareness of these issues should be introduced in the early years of a course. This would allow students to cultivate career appropriate social media profiles and practices before these issues become crucial.     References This is a list of all the sources referred to in the report. This should be on a separate page and should be done in accordance with the referencing style chosen by your school. Author date systems list the references in alphabetical order of the first author's surname. Footnoting styles list them in order of their appearance in the report.   Appendices This includes any documentation that has not been incorporated in the text, but is relevant at some point in the text. This may include:  data (graphs, charts, tables) or other documentation that is too long or complex to include in the body.

Answer: A. poor referencing technique Feedback: Not plagiarism. Leaving out extra references is not plagiarism, but listing multiple references where possible makes that claim stronger because it is widely accepted.   Situation 2: Two students work together finding sources and discuss an assignment that they must submit individually. There is great similarity in their arguments and citations. Answer: B. unintentional plagiarism Unintentional plagiarism. The claims\/ideas that the student included in his assignment are (in part) inspired or sourced from his friend. Working together on individual assignments leads to accidental plagiarism like this. You need to keep careful record of any ideas that belong to another student and cite them (as personal communications). These students should also find more references between the two of them to make their reference lists different as well.   Situation 3: A student bases their essay around an essay that their friend submitted for that subject the previous year. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism. This is representing the work of another person as your own. The fact that the submissions are separated in time makes no difference.   Situation 4: A student copies large amounts of text because they find it too difficult to change the language. They cite the author and the date but fail to use quotation marks. Answer: A. poor referencing technique Poor referencing technique. If you use the exact wording of a text, you must enclose those words in quotation marks and include the page or paragraph number in the citation. Otherwise, it appears that you have crafted those words. The student needs to develop some paraphrasing strategies.   Situation 5: Several citations are placed at the end of the paragraph so it is very difficult to decide what information is sourced from which article. Answer: A. poor referencing technique Not plagiarism. Listing all references at the end of a paragraph is not blatant plagiarism but it is not up to academic standard. The information needs to be easily traced to its original source and therefore the citation should be placed as close to the information as possible.   Situation 6: A student uses large sections of another essay that they previously wrote and submitted for a related subject at another university. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Plagiarism. You need to cite ideas or text as a reference if it is from work that has already been submitted for academic credit. This is so, even if you wrote it yourself! Any essay that has been submitted previously is recorded in Turnitin.   Situation 7: John uses an essay that his friend bought online last year but the friend did not submit it because he discontinued his course. Answer: C. deliberate plagiarism Clearly plagiarism.

Australian Vocational Education Review, 13(1), 1-5.  Paraphrase 1: Enticing aboriginal students to enter jobs in nursing and medicine is a future investment for both city and country indigenous communities. Explanation 1: This paraphrase is actually a word switch. The words of the original have been replaced by synonyms. For example, \"Encouraging\" h(1)as been replaced by \"Enticing\" and \"to work as health professionals\" has been replaced by \"to enter jobs in nursing and medicine\". The order of the word replacements also stays the same. Paraphrase 2: Indigenous communities regardless of their context could benefit from increased recruitment of aboriginal students into health professions. Explanation 2: This paraphrase has reordered the structure and the words significantly from the original. This is the better paraphrase.

If you wish to complete this exercise as a test, you can apply the following conditions:\n\n \ttime allocated: 1.5 hours\n \topen book exam.\n\nCase\nMerryn discovered that her car was stuck in soft sand when she returned to it after a day at the beach. She was not a member of auto assist and desperate to get home quickly. She called out to the people standing nearby that she would pay $500 to anyone who would pull her car free but no one was willing to help. While Merryn was walking back to the beach to get some help a council worker, Helen, drove into the car park to check on its condition and assist any motorists bogged in a soft patch. Helen noticed Merryn's car stranded and towed it to firm ground.\n\nAfter Helen towed Merryn's car to safety, a bystander told Helen about the $500 dollar reward promised by Merryn. Helen later approached Merryn regarding the $500 payment but Merryn refused to give it to her.\nTask\nAdvise Helen, giving reasons supported by case references, whether she is legally entitled to the payment from Merryn under the law of contract.\nApply the case outline to this case. Use it as the basis for constructing your answer.\nApply the model\nHaving read the case study, analyse the case in respect to the following categories.

The elements of a simple contract include: Intention, Agreement (offer + acceptance), Consideration, Capacity, Genuine Consent, and Legality. The first three elements must be satisfied in all simple contracts and may create an apparent simple contract. Elements 4-6 may affect the validity of a contract.\nRules\nOn the first element of intention, the agreement could be regarded as one of business involving payment for a service. The law presumes that there is an intention to create legal relations in business agreements (See Edwards v Skyways). If we were to argue it is a social agreement made on a beach, the rebuttal could apply as it appears Merryn is in serious trouble and the money offered for help is quite generous.\nApply\nMerryn would then appear to make a valid offer, however it is not clear that there has been a valid acceptance. An offer must be communicated to the offeree and acceptance must be made in reliance of the offer. It seems that Helen is unaware of Merryn's offer before she undertakes the task of helping her with the car before she knows there is a reward. Therefore no acceptance has been made at this stage (See R v Clarke).\nConclusion\nThere would also appear to be a problem with consideration. Consideration must be of a legal value and exchanged by both parties. It can be present, future but not past. It must be more than a person is already required to do by law or by contract. Since Helen tries to claim the $500 after she towed Merryn's car the consideration is past and not valid (See Roscorla v Thomas). When Helen took this action it seems to have been part of her job as a council worker and therefore the consideration is not sufficient (See Stylk v Myrick). There is no valid contract between Merryn and Helen.","excerpt":"This section will take you through the process of constructing a legal argument in contract law.

Below are some hints and tools using a problem from Company Law. When answering a legal problem, it is useful to apply the IRAC structure so that you address all areas required.\n\nIRAC structure\nThe IRAC method has four steps:\n\n \tIdentify the issue\n \tRelevant law - here you need to explain the law not just state it; this could be sections\/s of the Corporations Act or case law\n \tApplication to the facts - the law is applied to the facts of the problem\n \tConclusion\n\nUse the following IRAC structure as a guide to answer case study questions.\n\n\n\n \tIssue: Define the legal relevant issue.\n \tRelevant law: Identify legal principles from cases and statutes. Explain the law, don't just state it.\n \tApply to the facts: Develop legal arguments by applying the law to the facts.\n \tConclusion: Arrive at a considered conclusion.\n\nNote: Students gain the most marks by explaining the relevant law and then applying it to the facts.\n\n\nExample question and answer\nQuestion\nBingo Ltd is a manufacturer of electrical goods. It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\n(This a five-mark question)\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\n\n\nRelevant law\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\n\n\nApplication to facts\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\n\n\nConclusion\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\n\n\n\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only. Many Company Law problems will involve multiple issues. In these scenarios each issue would need to be addressed. For example: The first issue is... The second issue is whether...\n\nActivity 1\n1. Read the following question.\n\nGeraldine was appointed one of the directors of Mars Pty Ltd a couple of months ago. The company does not have a constitution. Geraldine's responsibilities as a director mean that she has to travel to the company's other offices in Queensland to sort out some company matters. Geraldine did not enter into a separate contract of employment with the company. Geraldine has tried to claim from the company her travelling and other expenses related to those trips to Queensland but the company refuses to reimburse her.\n\n\n2. Now read the following text and try to identify the IRAC structure. \u00a0Check your understanding by clicking on the buttons to reveal the IRAC structure.\nThe issue here is whether Geraldine has rights to enforce. There are three sources of company law rights: the statute, the common law and the internal rules. As a matter of internal rights and obligations the parties need to turn to the internal rules. Without a constitution to provide internal rules, the corporate parties Rules. 202A (2) provides \"the company may also pay the director's travelling and other expenses that they properly incur: ... (c) in connection with the company's business.\" This section provides discretion to the company regarding the payment of expenses. This means that the issue is a matter of private contract which is not addressed in the scenario. Accordingly, Geraldine has no statutory remedy and no remedy arising from the internal rules.\nIssueRelevant lawApply to the factsConclusionShow all\n\n\nActivity 2\nRead the following question, then identify which part of the IRAC structure best fits each text excerpt by selecting from the drop down menu.\nQuestion\nDouglas Holidays Pty Ltd is a company which owns two holiday villas in Port Douglas. There are twenty members who contribute an amount of $500 per annum for the general upkeep of villas.

It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\n(This a five-mark question)\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\n\n\nRelevant law\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case, is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Guildford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\n\n\nApplication to facts\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\n\n\nConclusion\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\n\n\n\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only. Many Company Law problems will involve multiple issues. In these scenarios each issue would need to be addressed. For example: The first issue is... The second issue is whether...\n\nActivity 1\n1. Read the following question.\n\nGeraldine was appointed one of the directors of Mars Pty Ltd a couple of months ago. The company does not have a constitution. Geraldine's responsibilities as a director means that she has to travel to the company's other offices in Queensland to sort out some company matters. Geraldine did not enter into a separate contract of employment with the company. Geraldine has tried to claim from the company her travelling and other expenses related to those trips to Queensland but the company refuses to reimburse her.\n\n2. Now read the following text and try to identify the IRAC structure. \u00a0Check your understanding by clicking on the buttons to reveal the IRAC structure.\n\nThe issue here is whether Geraldine has rights to enforce. There are three sources of company law rights: the statute, the common law and the internal rules. As a matter of internal rights and obligations the parties need to turn to the internal rules. Without a constitution to provide internal rules, the corporate parties Rules. 202A (2) provides \"the company may also pay the director's travelling and other expenses that they properly incur: ... (c) in connection with the company's business\". This section provides discretion to the company regarding the payment of expenses. This means that the issue is a matter of private contract which is not addressed in the scenario. Accordingly, Geraldine has no statutory remedy and no remedy arising from the internal rules.\nIssueRelevant lawApply to the factsConclusionShow all\n\n\nActivity 2\nRead the following question, then identify which part of the IRAC structure best fits each text excerpt by selecting from the drop down menu.\nQuestion\nDouglas Holidays Pty Ltd is a company which owns two holiday villas in Port Douglas.

In other words, the test will hold if A's actions or omissions may affect B in a reasonably foreseeable manner and consequently cause damage or suffering or damage to B. In this case, Groovy Clothing Store owes Bert a duty of care because Bert was in their premises and such duty of care is non-delegable (and hence could not be discharged) to Groovy Clothing Store's contractor who was hired to renovate the premises.  According to the 'neighbour' test, occupiers of land owe a duty of care to their entrants (neighbours) in respect of premises because of their control over the premise Australian Safeway Stores v Zaluzna. Since Bert's presence in the store was organised and controlled by the store, and it is reasonably foreseeable that Groovy Clothing Store's actions and omissions could cause damage to Bert and other shoppers, it is hence sufficient for Groovy Clothing Store to owe Bert a duty of care. \n\n\n\nExample 2\nHere the application of the law to the facts and the identification of legal issues have been interwoven together in one sentence.\nAlthough a shopper entering a shop like Groovy Clothing Store would not assume voluntarily (volenti non fit injuria) the risk of falling down a collapsed staircase,  in defence of its breaching duty of care,  Groovy Clothing Store could probably claim that Bert was partly liable for his injury due to his failure to take reasonable care of himself (contributory negligence) on the grounds that an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person  would not force him or herself up the stairs at the same time with so many people because of the foreseeability of an accident Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12.

Definitions\n4. Civil law\n\n2. Legal or\nnon-legal rule\n3. Criminal law\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of concept map 1 - the concept of law\n1. Definition\nLaw is a set of rules which aims to control people's behaviour.\n2. Legal versus non legal\nRules may be legal or non legal.\n\nLegal\n\nLegal rules can be enforced by authorities of the State such as the Australian Consumer &amp; Competition Commission (ACCC) which investigates matters arising from the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).\n\nNon legal\n\nNon legal rules apply to a particular group only and are generally only enforceable within that group, e.g. the Australian Football League (AFL) Tribunal.\n3. Criminal law\nCriminal law involves the regulation of behaviour which is considered to harm not only an individual victim but also has the potential to harm the whole of society. The person who commits the harm is known as the accused or defendant.\n\nFor example, if you kill another human being without reason, you clearly hurt the victim but also the social fabric of society. Action is then taken against you (the defendant) by the police and the courts on behalf of the rest of the community.\n4. Civil law\nCivil law involves private individuals who believe their personal rights have been wronged. The person who has been wronged (plaintiff) may sue (claim compensation\/remedy) from the person who harmed them (defendant).\n\n\n\nConcept map 2\n\n\n\n\nStudy the concept maps and explanations.\nThe common law system\n\n1.

Binding precedent\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of concept map 2 - the common law system\n1. Historical background\nAustralia's legal system is called a Common Law System for the following reasons:\n\n \tit was brought to us by the British\n \tit is based upon the idea of applying common legal principles to similar cases.\n\n2. Precedent\nPrecedent refers to a 'previous decision' of a court. Courts are bound to (must) follow decisions of other courts when the facts are the same in certain cases.\n3. Ratio decidendi\nRatio decidendi means the 'reason for a decision'. Courts must look closely at previous judgements to find why a decision was made. Future cases may be bound by a ratio decidendi of a previous case.\n4. Obiter dictum\nObiter dictum refers to opinions and observations made in a judgement which are not part of the ratio-decidendi. They may be interesting comments made by a judge \/ justice which highlight certain issues that are not necessarily part of their reasons for deciding a case the way they do. For example a comment may be made at the end of a judgement where it is stated that more changes to the law are needed to be made by parliament.\n5. Court hierarchy\nA court hierarchy is like a ladder of courts with the lowest or inferior court at the bottom, while the superior court sits at the top. The court hierarchy of each state is considered to be separate. However, as laws are made by both state and federal governments, and as a result of the Constitution, there are both state and federal courts. The highest court in Australia is the High Court of Australia. It usually hears only appeals. Original cases that go to the High Court are disputes regarding the Constitution.\n6. Binding precedent\nLower courts in the same hierarchy must follow the decisions of higher courts in the same hierarchy when the facts of the case are similar.\n7. Persuasive precedent\nSometimes even though the facts of a case may be similar, courts in different hierarchies (that is in different Australian states or countries) don't arrive at the same decision, although the previous decision may be referred to.\n\n\n\nConcept map 3\n\n\n\n\nStudy the concept maps and explanations.\nDispute resolution\n\n1. Litigation - court hierarchy\n\n\n \n2. Alternative\ndispute resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of concept map 3 - dispute resolution\n1. Litigation - court hierarchy\nWhen a civil case needs to be resolved through the courts, the process is called litigation. Litigation has been the traditional method of resolving disputes in Australia. Before a case is taken to court, the jurisdiction of the court must be considered, that is, different courts specialise in different areas and have different powers.\n2. Alternative dispute resolution\nAlternative dispute resolution refers to bodies outside the court system which can also be used to resolve legal disputes such as tribunals and the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria (DSCV). Sometimes the decisions made may be legally binding, as in tribunals, and others may not, as in the DSCV.\n\n\n\nConcept map 4\n\n\n\n\nStudy the concept maps and explanations.\nStatute law\n\n1. Federation\n\n\n \n2. Constitution\n \na. Powers\n \nb. Alteration\n\n3. Parliament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of concept map 4 - statute law\n1. Federation\nAustralia is a federation - a union of states who have their own powers of law making, as well as a national parliament which makes laws on behalf of the whole country.\n2. Constitution\nThe Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901 is a law which created the federal system of government.\n\n(a) Powers\n\nThe Constitution divides the powers of law making between the state and federal parliaments. This means that each parliament is allowed to make laws in areas granted to them by the Constitution. The powers are divided as follows:\n\n \tState \u2013 residual powers, e.g. education\n \tFederal \u2013 exclusive powers, e.g. military\n \tConcurrent \u2013 shared powers between state and federal parliament, e.g. taxation (see S109).\n\n(b) Alteration\n\nThe only way to change the words of the Constitution and create new areas of power for one or the other parliaments is through a referendum; a process by which Australian voters must vote Yes or No to the change.\n\nIf there are conflicts between the state and federal parliaments the High Court of Australia can interpret the words of the Constitution and make a decision in favour of one or the other parliaments. In this way an area such as the environment which may have been a residual power could be given over to the federal parliament if the High Court decides it is to be so (refer to the Franklin Dam Case).\n3. Parliament\nThe Australian system of parliament is based on the Westminster system of England. Parliament is made up of elected representatives who make laws to govern the state (state parliament) or the whole of the country (federal parliament).\n\nEach parliament in Australia is bi-cameral except for Queensland, that is the parliament is made up of 2 chambers (houses) in which proposals for new laws (bills) are debated and passed. Federally, the lower house, the House of Representatives, is where the government is represented and the upper house, the Senate, is where members from the government and other political parties reside whose main job is to review proposals for new laws.\n\n\n\n .popover{min-width: 300px} \n\n jQuery(function () { jQuery('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]').popover({ trigger:'focus' }) }) jQuery( window ).resize(function() { console.log(jQuery(\".accessibility-show\").width()) if(jQuery(\".accessibility-show\").width()","excerpt":"A concept map is a way of sequencing, ordering or breaking down information into its constituent parts.

Modernist Brasilia: A utopian paradox   Modernism in Brazil arose from optimistic visions of progress and stability. Brasilia, the new federal capital, was based on modernist principles on a very large scale. Commissioned to be the 'capital of hope' (Wheeler 2007, p. 64), it was meant to fulfil forecasts for an optimistic future, to be an 'elegy to progress, to modernity' (Madeleno 1996, p. 274). With these clearly modernist principles of promise and progress, Costa and Niemeyer developed the formal layout in the 'pilot plan' for Brasilia. The space was ordered into zones defined by two main axes: the 'monumental' and the 'highway' that intersected in a cross shape 'resulting in the modernist analogy to the wings of an aeroplane' (Wright &amp; Turkienicz 1998, p. 349). The spaces between were then ordered following Le Corbusier's principles of the functional city: spaces for specific purposes (Le Corbusier, cited in Mumford 2000). Hence, residential dwellings and places of work were separated and industry was removed to the outskirts of the city; cultural precincts were established near the green and open residential precincts; and the movement of pedestrians and vehicles was separated (Wright &amp; Turkienicz 1998, p. 349). This initial planning was to be repeated in the utopian vision for the interior spaces. Modern planning is derived from the design rationality: informed by the context of a site and the organisation of interior spaces according to the needs of the inhabitants (Treib 1993). Therefore it is apparent that the function of spaces and the links between these, and the users of the spaces, is paramount for the modern ideology for living (Eckbo, cited in Trieb 1993). In Brasilia, these ideals resulted in zoning separate sectors to accommodate differing civic amenities and functions. The residential areas are made up of self-contained 'super-blocks' of uniform height. Dwellings are separated from the work sectors with ample green space, offset from roadways. The separation of living and working areas was devised to fulfil the citizens' needs for rest, as Le Corbusier (cited in Mumford 2000) claimed that urban residents required spaces of natural greenery and freedom from noise and air pollution in order to live and work together without discord.The separation of space and purpose is illustrated by Costa's attempts to order aspects of daily life following his modernist, functional ideology.

An analysis of the urban layout sheds some light on this. Peculiarities in the combination of the highway system and the superblocks seem to have produced some bad results, at least in the case of Brasilia. The highway system is devoted to high speed motor vehicles. There are few crossings and roundabouts, and the terrain is flat. The super-blocks are self-contained dwelling units with a single access route. Inside is a relatively safe area for pedestrians, with wide entrances followed by narrower winding routes, as opposed to the wide, straight, long highways outside. When a car enters one of these axes it is naturally travelling at high speed. Pedestrians moving from one superblock to another or from one sector to another, have to cross these dangerous routes. The few underground crossings that exist are seldom used, since they are narrow, have 'L' shaped entrances and have become dirty and smelly: they are places where assaults can occur without surveillance. The combination of the superblock and the highway represents two extreme poles, with no intermediary scale. The result is a pervasive lack of continuity in the urban tissue: The space between the superblocks is clearly not a pedestrian's terrain.      The separation of land use as part of modernist design is also demonstrated in the circulation networks, with roads and pedestrian pathways disconnected from each other. Brasilia's pilot plan was developed with the two main roadways as the predominant means of circulation (Madaleno 1996). This was due to the automobile being perceived as a sign of modernist status and progress, a way forward literally and metaphorically. Read (2005:269) observes however, that it is 'impossible to circulate around the city without a car'. Large-scale residences have vast spaces in between with few or no facilities for pedestrians who, in order to travel to another sector, must cross a number of multiple lane, high-speed expressways (Wright and Turkienicz 1988). The spatial segregation and transport solutions have resulted in 'a pervasive lack of continuity in the urban tissue: The space between the superblocks is clearly not a pedestrian's terrain' (Wright and Turkienicz 1988:355). This incongruity is an illustration of how the pursuit of modern ideals by Costa and Niemeyer was unwavering, and where inflexible conceptual thought does not fulfil the needs of the residents of this utopia.       jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery(\"#buttons\").sticky({topSpacing:20,zIndex:99}); }); var types = [\"color1\",\"color2\",\"color3\",\"color4\",\"color5\"] var colors = [\"#DDF5FD\",\"#FBE6E6\",\"RGBA(0, 137, 97, 0.2)\",\"#DFDBFF\",\"RGBA(255, 122, 0,0.2)\"] var fontColors = [\"#104880\",\"#D50000\",\"#008944\",\"#A12CFF\",\"#FF7A12\"] jQuery(\".button\").click(function(){ jQuery(\"#showAll\").removeClass(\"pressed\").text(\"show all\") for (var i=0; i","excerpt":"nodeID: 1025 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: To reinforce your argument, integrate the analysis of experts by using citations - both direct and indirect.

[\/tab] [tab title=\"Mind mapping\"] Mind mapping Mind mapping is a visual representation of the focus and structure of a task. The advantage of creating and developing a mind map is that it gives you a holistic view of the task and helps you identify relationships between ideas.  There are three stages in the process.   Stage 1: The free-thinking (brainstorming) stage. At this stage, all ideas are relevant.  Stage 2: The identification stage (initial mind mapping). This stage is where you identify and clarify relationships between ideas and discard anything outside of your focus.  Stage 3: The grouping and organising stage (final mind mapping). In this part of the process, group your ideas into logical categories and, in doing so, build the structure of your assignment. This stage will also idenfify any gaps in your research.

Who made it? When was it made? What will be covered: What relevance does it have for us today? Argument \/ Position: Why was it important at the time?  Example 1: Wolfgang Weingart [context]The 1960s was a period of transition from old ways of thinking to new as rapid changes in technology, social and political ideologies, and increasing globalisation affected aesthetic archetypes and design principles. Typografische Monatsblatter (TM), one of the few international design magazines, set trends in communication design. [end context][what will be covered]Wolfgang Weingart's cover designs for TM demonstrated his objection to the perceived conservatism and design limitations inherent in Swiss Typographic style, reflecting broader, international politico-social unrest. His experimental media combinations and playful subjectivity resonated with a youthful, international audience, and inspired the next generation of designers to create a post-modern aesthetic. [end what will be covered][argument\/position]Weingart's philosophy of design practice calls for a commitment to the act of design, to focus on design as an iterative process of experimentation, prototyping and continuous refinement.[end argument\/position] Example 2: Atelier Populaire [context]The social and political revolution that erupted in Paris and throughout France during 1968 was the tonal landscape in which the Atelier Populaire was born. It grew out of student-artists' solidarity with workers and communicated a direct challenge to the repressive socio-political authoritarianism of the conservative De Gaulle government. The Atelier Populaire curated an unprecedented outpouring of political graphic art and graffiti (Kugelberg 2010) throughout May and June of 1968.[end context][what will be covered]During this period it used irony and dialectical imagery to transform the poster into a powerful object of revolutionary communication. [end what will be covered][argument\/position] In doing so, the Atelier Populaire established precedents for contemporary political communication design.[end argument\/position] Example 3: Otl Aicher [context]Influential German designer Otl Aicher is best known for his visual for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, which has become a significant work within the history of communication design. [end context][what will be covered] Aicher's pragmatic design practice and overall design control defined the Munich Games project, and was informed by a strong political and social responsibility and key functionalist principles.[end what will be covered][argument\/position]His focus on the design process and application of standardised design elements and governing rules has seen the project's legacy carry well beyond the 1972 Olympic Games to remain relevant and salient today.[end argument\/position]  [\/tab] [tab title=\"Body paragraphs\"] Well-structured body paragraphs help the reader to follow your analysis.

By 1968, demand for changes in social relationships, the emancipation and politicisation of women and minorities, and increasing urbanisation contributed to a global expectation of rebellion, particularly against the social conservatism of the preceding decades.  It was also the beginning of a period of intense student activism against authoritarian and patriarchal governments (Villiger 2013). In the United States, where Swiss Style had become synonymous with corporate America, socio-political tensions surrounding the Vietnam War emerged (Paradis et al. 2013).  Weingart started using more organic and emotional shapes, such as the Issue 11, 1973 cover for TM (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c), where the typography is all but obscured by spaces which could be interpreted as bullet holes.The increasing awareness of global complexity and social turmoil encouraged experimentalism and a move away from anonymity to individualism in design.  Weingart believed that for a designer to truly realise their personal typographic ideas, they must first explore all potential design paths via experimentation. However, to do so, typographers needed to understand basic design principles and processes to find solutions to design problems (Heller 2005; Kelley 2015; Schemer-Schebbin 1991).

Example 1: Wolfgang Weingart [Restate the argument]Wolfgang Weingart's critical questioning of assumed principles of design remains an important element of a designer's philosophy of practice today.[End Restate the argument][Sum up the main points] As a designer, Weingart has had his work applauded for its break from the conservatism of the International style and celebrated for its individualism. Yet his focus on experimentation and embrace of technology did not distract from his belief that a designer must understand the basic principles of design practice and graphic techniques to underpin their personal practice.[End Sum up the main points][Relate to the broader topic] His more expressive approach to typography encouraged new perspectives and a reaction against the corporatisation of the Swiss Typographic Style.[End Relate to the broader topic] Example 2: Atelier Populaire [Restate the argument]The Atelier Populaire was successful in using &lsquo;the power of democratic speech and popular urban mobilisation to transform society and potentially to transform the state' (Deaton 2013).[End Restate the argument][Sum up the main points]Although the Atelier did not immediately achieve its goal of influencing a mass political turnover of capitalist oppression, they were able to broadcast their revolutionary messages and demonstrate their solidarity with the people of France.

MODERNISM: The Intersection Keywords: break, rational, order, dominant, separation, hierarchy  Amid growing populations and expanding urban sprawls, it is essential for logical, functional design to supersede a merely aesthetic, classical approach to landscape architecture. By examining the intersection site using modernist principles outlined in Marc Treib's (1993), Axioms for a modern landscape architecture, latent, modernist, spatial arrangements embedded within the site are revealed and drawn out. The most significant element to consider is the circulation of people as they move through the site and their reasons for doing so. Using a rational approach, the lines, spaces and forms of the site are selected to emphasise them. 'Form [is] derived from the accommodation of the program' (Treib 1993:62) to include the specific requirements of the client, the site and its uses. The layout of the plan is developed and the spaces between are formed. The hierarchy of circulation is represented through tonal variation; the darkest tone relating to the dominance of the tramline, and the lightest pertaining to the pedestrian traffic. Identification and representation of this rational hierarchy of separated programs indicates an inherent order within the site, as the modernist landscape 'ultimately concerns making outdoor places for human use' (Treib 1993:55). The absence of a central axis in the site allows for an omnidirectional use of the space, accommodating both formal and informal occupation. All elements of the site follow modernist principles. Even the trees are positioned rationally; they appear in isolation rather than in naturalistic clusters, to heighten their sculptural qualities. This is a clear break from a formal, classical style as Tunnard (cited in Treib 1993:56) explains, 'selection, not massing for picturesque effect is the requirement' of an ordered, modernist approach.  By adopting tools and techniques from modernist principles, the intersection site is reordered and redrawn in plan, revealing a rational, underlying ordering of space.

Throughout the course I was exposed to immersive and interactive design principles; that combine sound, visual, text and spatial elements to create positive learning environments. At the Melbourne Museum and the Melbourne Zoo the exhibitions are created with attention to elements such as: goals or challenges to overcome, stimulus of the senses, feelings of control and minimal distractions. Lidwell, Holden and Butler (2003) suggest these elements are necessary to create a successful immersive experience. Stevenson (1994, p.32) highlights the effectiveness of interactivity to 'inspire and provoke exploration ... and to tempt people to look more thoughtfully' at the displays. Through designing my own miniature suitcase exhibition in this studio, I have gained an understanding of how to undertake integrated design for learning and play. Falk and Dierking's contextual model of learning (2012) suggests that a visitor's personal, sociocultural and physical context all work together to shape their experiences and what they decide to absorb and learn from an exhibition. The idea that the visitor contributes to the learning process, which is a feedback loop between museum and visitor, allows for more flexible and positive, interactive play and learning. Appreciating how these elements combine with the use of different mediums and techniques will assist me in my future practice to create memorable, impactful and effective learning and play environments.

(Source: University of Sydney, GGA Working Group Learning Outcomes, www.itl.usyd.edu.au\/) Learning outcomes and the curriculum Scaffold group work skills Even after some years of tertiary education, students may not know how to work productively with others in groups. It is helpful to scaffold the skills and capabilities required. Some students will learn collaborative skills through osmosis but many will need to be taught them. To plan for this, include such skills in the curriculum\u2019s learning outcomes. Explicit curriculum-based recognition of the skills acquired through collaboration ensures that group work, both process and product, is taught in the class room and assessed. In turn, students recognise the significance of such skills to their current study and their future employability. Group work skills are ideally included in learning outcomes at program, course and task levels. If such learning outcomes are not included at the program level, start at the task level.

What should be assessed in group work?   Process   Contributions of group members Impact of individual group members on group dynamic      Product   Report, case study, essay, model etc.    What are the options? Getting the assessment right is critical. Decisions need to be focussed around four factors:  What is to be assessed? Product? Process? Both? What proportion of marks for each? What criteria will be used to assess the process? The product? Who will determine this criteria - lecturer, students or both? Who will apply the assessment criteria and determine marks? Lecturer? Students? Peer and\/or self-assessment or a combination? How will marks be distributed? (shared group mark, group average, individually, combination?).  What aspects of the group process could be assessed? Groups are often more motivated and successful when students are invited to contribute to assessment criteria. When developing these criteria, ensure they are aligned with the learning outcomes. Assessment of process could include things such as:  adoption of group roles and responsibilities regular meeting attendance equity of contribution appropriate time and task management application of creative problem solving use of a range of working methods appropriate level of engagement with task development of professional communication skills evidence of capacity to listen  responsiveness to feedback\/criticism.  (Adapted from: Centre for the Study of Higher Education, 2002. Assessing group work. http:\/\/www.cshe.unimelb.edu.au\/assessinglearning\/03\/group.html) How could you assess these skills? With group work assessment, there are often complaints about the unfairness of the marking. Clarity regarding the allocation of marks is important. Will you be allocating marks to the group as a whole or to the individuals in the group? Or both? Consider the following methods of assessing group process skills:  Individual\u2019s reflective journal on the group process (lecturer\/tutor assessment). Be clear about focus of writing and provide a rubric See Learning Lab Reflective Writing Peer review and peer assessment (student assessment component)  Self-assessment  Presentations by individual students.  Assessment rubrics for group work There are numerous rubrics for group work. Your choice of criteria and scales depends on your particular project but the following Rubric Directory provides a choice of rubrics you can use for peer, self and group evaluation: California State University, Fullarton, Mihaylo college of Business and Economics, Assessment and Instructional Support: Rubric Directory\/ Peer Evaluations, People Skills (collaboration, working in groups) http:\/\/business.fullerton.edu\/centers\/CollegeAssessmentCenter\/RubricDirectory\/other_rubrics.htm","excerpt":"nodeID: 1015 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Assessing the group process encourages students to become aware of the dynamics of their group \u2013 how tasks are approached, methods of problem solving, and the productivity or otherwise of interactions and contributions.

After each tutorial, test your knowledge with the interactive activities.  Finding the volume required What is volume required formula? This formula tells us how much liquid-form medication we need to give a patient, considering the strength they need and the source that it comes from. This tutorial introduces the Volume Required formula and shows you how to apply it to a problem.   Using proportions with liquid solutions If you need double the dose of medication, you need to give double the volume of the liquid that it is dissolved in and so on. This is the simple principle behind the Volume Required formula. Learn how you could solve these problems before applying the formula.   Converting between large and small units How do you convert between units? Nurses use units that begin with milli and micro a lot. If you express your dosage in a smaller unit, the number must get bigger, and vice versa. Find out how to convert dosages between larger and smaller units.   Medication dosage by body weight How do you deal with a unit like mg\/kg? Milligrams per kilogram means that you must give a certain amount (mgs) of a drug for each kilogram of the patient\u2019s body mass. Bigger patients need a bigger dose! Learn what this unit means and when and how to use it.\u00a0\u00a0  The flow rate formula What does Flow Rate = Volume\/time mean? Flow rate is determined by the volume of liquid that passes by (into a patient) within a certain time period. This is the fundamental formula for all IV problems.\u00a0\u00a0  Managing fractions and decimals What do you do if the Flow Rate calculation involves fractions such as \u00bc of an hour or 0.5 litres? Find out how this is managed mathematically.   Drop factor: converting between millilitres and drops Drops are just another unit for measuring the amount of fluid flowing into a patient\u2019s system. Discover what \u2018drop factor\u2019 means, and how to convert between millilitres and drops.\u00a0  Converting flow rates between mL\/hr and dpm How do you convert IV flow rates? In the previous video, we looked at converting between millilitres (ml) and drops. This time we are converting not only the volumes, (drops and mls) but the units for time as well.

[tabs type=\"tabs\"] [tab title=\"Introduction\" active=\"true\"] Write concisely by:  1. Making the actor and the action clear Attempts at writing in an academic style often result in the meaning being buried under a pile of nominalisations* and the prepositional phrases^ needed to support them. While some nominalisations are useful and appropriate, using too many makes sentences unwieldy and hides the main action. Terminology  * A nominalisation is an abstract noun based on a verb or adjective, often ending in -tion, -ence, -ity, -ness, -ment, etc., e.g. education (from educate), agreement (from agree). ^ A prepositional phrase is a preposition followed by a noun phrase, e.g. in the university.    2.

Be brutal: delete meaningless, doubled and implied terms, and replace unnecessarily long phrases with shorter ones.

How do I deal with measurement errors? Measurement is an important skill for everyday life but especially in fields of STEM. These pages will enhance your understanding of measurement, units and how to deal with errors.   Dimensions All measurements need a value as well as a unit of measurement. All physical units of measurement can be broken down to a few component parts such as meters for length, seconds for time or kilograms for mass. Read this worksheet to see how complex physical units are built from basic components. From this you can better understand what the units represent, and check if a calculation has been made properly.   Units, prefixes and conversions A measurement is not complete without its units: 20 meters is meaningless without the meters (m). Some measurements are very small, or large, and require smaller or larger versions of the unit. It is important to convert between units when a smaller or larger unit is more appropriate. Read this page to learn about different sized units, the prefixes that identify them, and how to move from one to the other.   Errors in measurement How do I calculate the error in my experiment? Every measurement involves some inaccuracy and we explore this. Read these pages to understand the types of errors that come up with measurements in your experiments and practical work.

Original text Studying in a new environment is different and therefore can be stressful. Tertiary students come from a variety of backgrounds and are studying for different purposes. Students may have come straight from secondary school, they may be a \u2018mature age\u2019 student who has decided to pursue another career, or they may be an international student and have just arrived in Australia. For many students whatever their background, tertiary learning is different from their previous studies. Students may be worried about the amount of reading required, or whether they will be able to study efficiently enough to get through their exams. They may also worry about the tertiary learning expectations and requirements.   Summary 1  Students from different backgrounds, including secondary, mature age and international, are concerned about the amount of reading required in tertiary study.    This summary represents the student group reasonably well, but reading is the only challenge mentioned. The problems of the original are broader and more specific. The notion of \u2018stress \u2018 or \u2018a new learning environment\u2019 have been omitted in the summary.     Summary 2  Tertiary learning is often a new environment for students particularly internationals as they are unsure of what is expected of them.    This summary is not inaccurate although not the best. It emphasizes international students which does not reflect the original. The original specifies problems (i.e. reading and exams) that are not implicit in the words \u201cBeing unsure of what is expected\u201d.     Summary 3  For many students, including those from diverse backgrounds, it is often difficult to adapt to new tertiary learning environments. Managing workloads, understanding expectations and how to study effectively for exams can be extremely stressful.    An accurate and well-balanced summary.      Original text Studying in a new environment is different and therefore can be stressful. Tertiary students come from a variety of backgrounds and are studying for different purposes. Students may have come straight from secondary school, they may be a \u2018mature age\u2019 student who has decided to pursue another career, or they may be an international student and have just arrived in Australia. For many students whatever their background, tertiary learning is different from their previous studies. Students may be worried about the amount of reading required, or whether they will be able to study efficiently enough to get through their exams. They may also worry about the tertiary learning expectations and requirements.  Summary 1: Students from different backgrounds, including secondary, mature age and international, are concerned about the amount of reading required in tertiary study. Explanation 1: This summary represents the student group reasonably well, but reading is the only challenge mentioned. The problems of the original are broader and more specific. The notion of \u2018stress \u2018 or \u2018a new learning environment\u2019 have been omitted in the summary. Summary 2: Tertiary learning is often a new environment for students particularly internationals as they are unsure of what is expected of them. Explanation 2: This summary is not inaccurate although not the best. It emphasizes international students which does not reflect the original. The original specifies problems (i.e. reading and exams) that are not implicit in the words \u201cBeing unsure of what is expected\u201d.

A paraphrase is a restatement. It is the information or idea from a text in your own words.   To paraphrase, convey the original meaning but change the words and the sentence structure, and add a reference (i.e. the author name and the year of publication).  The aim of a paraphrase is to integrate the idea into a paragraph of your own writing. This is referred to as a citation.   It is common for paragraphs to contain more than one citation. If you want to cite an idea from another text in your paragraph, you need to ensure that you paraphrase and reference that idea separately. There are examples of this on the synthesising page of this tutorial.   To paraphrase:   start the sentence at a different point from the original (e.g. object to subject)  change words where appropriate: use synonyms  change the sentence structure (e.g. from\u202factive to passive voice)  separate ideas into shorter sentences or statements.    Avoiding plagiarism You can avoid plagiarism by paraphrasing correctly. Plagiarism is the direct copying of published work without acknowledging (citing) it. It appears that you take credit for the ideas of another author. In academia, this is considered academic misconduct or cheating. Learning how to paraphrase correctly will help to avoid penalties due to plagiarism. \u202f  Sometimes you will use direct quotes to emphasise a point or argument however, these should be used sparingly to demonstrate you have understood the content.    Changing the words To paraphrase a text, follow these steps.   Read the text you want to cite; locate the idea that is relevant for your purpose.   If you do not understand the idea,\u202fdo not\u202fattempt to paraphrase it. There is a risk that you will just copy it.   Circle the specialised words, i.e. the words that the text is actually about. These words or terms need to be included in your paraphrase.   Underline the words that can be changed.   Replace these words with words or phrases of similar meaning. Use a thesaurus or dictionary for synonyms, or the academic word lists for different word forms.   You now have a starting point to construct your paraphrase. Write the sentence in your own words when you are confident you understand it.   Changing the structure The other way to paraphrase is to change the structure of the original.    Read the text and make sure you understand the main idea. Do not copy \u202fit.  Start at a different point from the original. This means that you do not copy the text word for word. Write the idea from memory.  Write short sentences and change the order of the words.   Check what you have written against the original text to avoid accidental plagiarism. You should ensure that your version is different but that you have retained the original idea.

When a number such as 16 is written in the form 42\u202f(which means 4 x 4) we say that it is written as an exponential, or in index notation. There are laws about multiplying and dividing indices as well as how to deal with negative indices.   ILS1.2 Fractional indices Can an index also be a fractional number? An index can be an integer \u2013 a counting number - either positive or negative. An index can also be a fraction such as \u00bd, \u00be, or 2.5. Read this section to see what this means, and how the laws of indices apply to fractional indices.  ILS2.1 Logarithms What is a logarithm? The logarithm of a number is the power that the base must be raised to, to give that number. The logarithm of 16 with a base of 2 is 4, because 24 = 16.

[Slide 2: Workshop outline]   Description: 'What will I be learning?\u2019  An introduction to academic reading and its purposes  The process of academic reading  Strategies for keeping records    Narrator:Welcome to the module on Academic Reading for postgraduate coursework students. Our aim is to help you read less and think more. In other words, to make your reading more active. There are three sections: in the first we give a broad view of academic reading and it's purposes. In the second section, we'll look at the process of academic reading, and in section three we'll show you some strategies for keeping records of what you read. We hope you'll find some useful tips and strategies throughout the module.   [Slide 3: Introduction to Academic Reading]   Description: Title slide   Narrator:  No narration.   [Slide 4: Part 1 - What is academic reading?]   Description:     A animation broken into three parts, each fading in and out.   Part 1: \u2018We read for many reasons but not all in the same way\u2019. Two iconography representing leisurely and academic reading respectively.   Part 2: Heading: Leisurely reading. Iconography is accompanied with the following text:   Drift through  Let your mind wander    Part 3: Heading: Academic reading. Iconography is accompanied with the following text:    Engage with the material  Understand the topic or concept  Give a range of viewpoints  Develop a foundation    Narrator: We read for many reasons, but we don't necessarily read in the same way for each of these reasons. Sometimes, we just need to skim through texts; in other texts, we might only read a specific section. If we're reading for fun, for example, reading a novel, we're likely to drift through it, letting our minds be carried away with the story. But if we read academic texts in this way, we're not likely to engage with the material or get much out of it.   [Slide 5: Part 2 - What is academic reading?]   Description: Six different iconographies representing the following points:  Getting a broad overview of a topic or concept  Finding support for an argument - getting evidence  Getting the gist of a research article  Searching for concrete facts or figures  Making new discoveries Identifying gaps in the literature Making new connections or solutions    Narrator: Academic reading is about extracting information and making connections. But there are many specific reasons for academic reading. Here are some of the most common reasons. Note that, particularly at postgraduate level, we make new discoveries that beyond what we've read. These discoveries could be identifying gaps in the literature, or making new connections or solutions.   [Slide 6: Levels of reading]   Description:  Graphic of three blocks: red, blue and green creating a stack animating one after the other. Each represents different levels of reading.   Red: Highschool: Reading to extract information   Blue: Undergraduate: Reading to make connections   Green: Postgraduate: Reading to create meaning   Accompanying this is the following text:   Academic reading is:  Active  Purposive \u201ccritical\u201d reading  Asking questions about the text  Having a discussion with the author\/text    Narrator: It's useful to think of reading at three levels: at high school, we mainly read for information; at undergraduate level, we make connections, at postgraduate level, we create meaning. But it's important to remember that each of these levels incorporates the lower levels;   that is, we can't create meaning without also making connections and extracting information. Also, you won't always be reading to create meaning - sometimes you'll just need to find information.   So, what is reading in the academic environment? It's much more than just decoding and understanding the words. Effective academic reading is active, purposive reading that asks questions of the text. Academic reading, particularly at postgraduate level, is also about making decisions about the text by judging its worth. It's useful to think about reading as discussing the text with the author. This conversation help us to stay actively engaged with the text. Also, with academic reading, it's not so much about the quantity of reading you do, but what you actually get out of each text and how you'll use this that's important.   [Slide 7: Academic reading and critical thinking]   Description: A visual of two arrows forming a cyclic process: the above being blue, and red at the bottom.   Blue represents - Academic reading: Purposive reading to evaluate information and ideas, and decide what to accept and believe.   Red represents -Critical thinking: Technique to evaluate information and ideas, and decide on what to accept and believe.   At the centre of this visual description is the quote: \u2018Knowledge depends on thought\u2019   Narrator:Academic reading is closely related to critical thinking. We need to think critically to deeply understand and make sense of academic texts. At the same time, being able to read critically depends on critical thinking. In other words, knowledge depends on thought. However, it's difficult to pick up an academic text and read it critically straight away. to make it easier, there is a process you can follow. This is discussed in section two.      The process of academic reading   [Slide 8: Part 1 - The process of academic reading]   Description: Title slide   Narrator: Before we go further, think about reading and answer the question: How do you read?   [Slide 9: Part 2 - The process of academic reading]   Description: An animation broken into 2 parts to form a whole picture.   Part 1: Passive reading; Visual representation of a journal article, emphasising line-by-line reading.   Part 2: Active reading; Visual representation of a restaurant menu, with certain items circled an emphasis on identifying information.   Narrator: What was your answer? Perhaps you said we start by reading the first word on the first line, reading line by line until we reach the end, as we were taught in primary school. However, using this strategy for academic reading is likely to end in passive reading, where you remember very little of what you've read. Clearly, we need a more effective process. It's useful to see the text as a menu. Just as you choose items on a menu, you identify specific information   in a text and use this for a specific purposes. Of course, you might find that the text isn't useful at all, just as you might find that you don't really want to eat Chinese after all. Making active choices helps to keep you actively involved in the text. Add chinese recipes on the menu   [Slide 10: Part 1 - Steps in the process]   Description: Numbered iconography of the three different steps, with one and two being linked.   1. 1. Prepare initial questions. For example, how might you use the material? How does the text relate to what you already know?   2. 2. Preview the text, then decide whether you need to read the text closer   3. 3. When necessary, read the text closely.   Narrator: Although academic reading tends to be cyclical process, we're showing it here linearly. Our first step is to ask some initial questions about what we want to know, then we preview the text to see if it's likely to give us answers to these questions. If the answer is yes, we take a close read of the text, marking points that are useful to us, and identifying the main points and arguments. Then we summarise and reflect how and where we'll use this information.   An important point to note here is that, depending on your purpose, you might only complete the first two steps; if you only want the gist of a text, there's no need to go into it deeply - a simple skim will do the job. Note that all of these steps involve asking questions. Perhaps the two most important questions to ask yourself throughout each step in this process are how the content relates to what you already know, and how you might use the content. The following slides develop each of the steps in the process.   [Slide 11: Part 2 - Prepare initial questions]   Description: A table broken into three columns: why? what? where? Each has a description, and bulleted points.   Why? What is your purpose? What do you want from it?  To gather information for an assignment or essay  To get the main points about a topic or concept before a lecture   What? What kind of information are you looking for?  Argumentative essay  Information for a report  To understand a new topic    Where? Where will you find the information?  Text book  Business journal  Online resource    Narrator: Our first question is why you need to read and what kind of information will help you. Also there's no point in reading an academic text unless you know what you want from it.   Are you looking for points to develop for an argumentative essay? Or are you looking for information for a report? Or maybe you're hoping to find a text that will help you to get a gist of a new topic. When you're clear about what you're looking for, you need to ask yourself where you'll find this information - in a journal article? A textbook? A book of edited chapters?   An online resource maybe? Don't forget that the liaison librarian for your school can help you   with your search - you'll find a list of all liaison librarians on the RMIT Library website.    [Slide 12: Part 1 - Ask yourself, is the text: Introduction]    Description:  Relevant  Authoritative  Recent  Objective    Narrator: When we know what we want and we've found a text that might be useful, we do a quick preview of it. As we read the text we need to read about these four questions [description ponts]   [Slide 13: Part 2 - Ask yourself, is the text: Relevant]   Description: Heading: Is the text relevant? Accompanied by a graphic of a journal article with question marks surrounding it:  Relevant to my purpose?  Will it help me?  Is it useful?    Narrator: How is it relevant to my current purpose? For example, how might this be useful for my essay or report? Will it help me get the gist of a topic?    [Slide 14: Part 3 - Ask yourself, is the text: Authoritative]    Description: Heading: Is the text authoritative? Accompanied by a graphic of a journal article with question marks surrounding it, and a person iconography with the following points:  Who?  What\u2019s their standing?    Narrator: By authoritative, we mean who was it written by? Does this person have standing in your scholarly field? This is particularly important with online texts. If you don't know who wrote it, don't use it.   [Slide 15: Part 4 - Ask yourself, is the text: Recent]   Description: Heading: Is the text recent? Accompanied by a graphic of a journal article with question marks and the years 1992 and 2014 surrounding it with the following points:  What year was it published?  Is it old?    Narrator: Generally, we should choose the most recent research to cite. Different subject areas in the university have different ideas about how old is 'old', but in general you should choose articles that are no older than 5 - 8 years unless there is a good reason for using an older text (for example, some seminal work that is older but still discussed in the literature is generally OK to use).   [Slide 16: Part 5 - Ask yourself, is the text: Objective]   Description: Heading:Is the text objective? Accompanied by a graphic of a journal article with a question mark and the following points:  Free from bias?  Persuasive?    Narrator: Is the text objective and free from bias? Beware of texts that are written to persuade you.   [Slides 17 + 18 + 19: Previewing steps]   The following three slides will have the same description but different accompanying text.   Description: Remind yourself of your initial questions, then: In three different boxes, with arrows in between them representing a step-by-step process.   1. 1. Skip   2. 2. Skim   3. 3. Record   [Slide 17: Part 1 - Previewing steps]   Description: 1. Skip through the text  Look at title &amp; year; author &amp; affiliation; headings\/outlines (what \u2018story\u2019 do they tell?); tables of figures.  Notice what type of literature it is: Research? Practice? Policy? Theoretical? Review article?    Narrator: Once you've reminded yourself of your pre-reading questions, skip through the text looking at the title and year, the author and affiliation. Quickly glance at the table of contents if it has one; check out the headings and subheadings. While you're doing this, keep your initial questions in mind e.g. what are you looking for, and why?   [Slide 18: Part 2 - Previewing steps]   Description: 2. Skim the text  Read abstract, introduction, topic sentence of each paragraph, and conclusion; look over references.  Look for the purpose and main point or argument.    Narrator: If the text looks interesting and appropriate, skim the text to get the gist of it. Read the abstract, introduction, topic sentences of each paragraph (usually the first sentence), and the conclusion. The abstract and conclusion are useful because they summarise key information. The introduction is important because it contains the 'thesis statement' - main argument or point of the article. Then quickly look over the references to see who's been cited. This helps you to build a picture of the key scholars in that topic area. Skimming is important because it allows you to get the gist of the text without reading the entire text. If you decide that the text isn't as useful for your purposes as you thought, you haven't wasted a lot of time reading the entire document.   [Slide 19: Part 3 - Previewing steps]   Description: 3. Record brief notes  The beginning of a personal bibliographic record  Just a few dot points of at least the bibliographic details of the text    Narrator:Finally briefly record what you found. This is just the beginning of a personal bibliographic record, so it's OK to just write a few dot-points - at least record the bibliographic details. See the record keeping section later for more details.   [Slide 20 with the title: How to skim]   Description: Animated sample of the text, \u2018Globalisation and internationalising the curricula\u2019 it emphasises the following three parts:  Topic sentences make up key points  Anything after the topic sentence of each paragraph is striked through  The main key points are given for each topic sentence (which will be narrated).    Narrator: Before we move onto close reading, we mentioned that skimming a text involves reading the topic sentences of each paragraph. Topic sentences are important because they carry the key points in each paragraph, and if we're just trying to get the gist of the text, we don't need the detail after each point. You can see here, just by reading the topic sentence of each paragraph (in green), you get the broad storyline of the text: It's difficult to define globalisation; GATS is a major impact on globalisation of education; universities have encouraged internationalisation; not only do we get the big picture, but we also know where to find the details. If any of the main points are important to us. Of course, it's not always as easy as this because some writers don't habitually write the topic sentence as the first sentence. However, in most texts you'll be able to quickly find the topic sentence with a bit of practice.   [Slide 21: Close reading - Introduction]   The following slides: 22 [understand], 23 [analyse] , 24 [evaluate] , 28 [apply] will all have a checklist layout, \u2018Ask yourself\u2019...list of questions.   Description:   Narrator: When you've previewed the text and know that it will be useful, the next step is to closely read the text, which leads to reading critically. It's useful to see close reading from four different perspectives: Understand the content Analyse the argument. Evaluate the strength of the position made Enter the Closed Caption Text. Understand how you can use the text. Just a reminder that every step in the reading process involves asking questions. We've identified some key questions in each of the following, but for further questions that might help you with close reading, download the pdf. Remember, though, that they key questions to keep asking are how the information fits with what you already know, and how you might use the information. Add audio.   [Slide 22: Close reading - Understand]   Description: Comprehending more of the text  What is the author trying to accomplish?  What is the author\u2019s position \/ view \/ message?  What are the main points \/ claims?  What are the recurring key words or phrases?  Are the [key] words used ambiguously?  What theory is used?    Narrator: Our first pass at reading is to skip and skim to get the gist of the text. When we read for understanding, we're reading for more detail. If there are words you don't understand, try to guess what they mean first, then circle them. Keep reading and when you've finished, find their meanings and re-read the sections of text around them.   [Slide 23: Close reading - Analyse]   Description: Identifying the component parts and how they\u2019ve been put together   Questions asked for a journal article  Does it have a typical structure?  What theory is developed?  What methodology is used?  For a argumentative texts, what is the argument and how is it developed?  For information-based texts, is there a logical flow of ideas?    Narrator: The second perspective is to analyse the text by asking questions that look specific elements in the text. This is where your reading becomes more critical. You're asking yourself how the text works to 'tell the story'. What are the component elements? How do they fit logically together? In reality, this perspective is often merged with evaluation, which is discussed in the following.   [Slide 24: Close reading - Evaluate]   Description: Looking at the strength and value of the text  Have the stated claims been achieved?  Is the study grounded in good methodology?  What are the underlying assumptions and are they reasonable?  Are the conclusions valid, credible, and reliable?  Are there any biases?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is there missing information?  Do you reach the same conclusions?  What evidence or examples have they used and have they been referenced to a reliable source?    Narrator: This is where we ask how strong and valid the text is. What is its value? Critical reading is central in this perspective. It's where we ask whether the intention of the author has been fulfilled in a satisfactory way. In other words, does the text do what it set out to do? Can we feel confident about the conclusions? Is there missing or misleading information? This is where we ask how strong and valid the text is.    [Slide 25: Close reading - Evaluate: Identifying arguments]    Description: Example of a claim: Smoking is bad for your health, with the following supporting premises:  The link between smoking and respiratory disease is well-established.  Smoking can lead to a heart attack.    Narrator: An argument is made up of a claim (sometimes called a proposition, contention or conclusion). This claim is then backed up with premises (also called evidence, or reasons).   Here's an example. We can claim that smoking is bad for our health by providing evidence (the two premise here). Claims and premises can be true or false. How do we judge? Next we'll look at some ways of judging credibility. Following that we'll talk about inferences. As mentioned we look at the weight of evidence or we make assumptions to infer the truth of a claim. Here's an example of assumptions and inference and how they relate to claims and premises. Take some time to read it and decide if the premises support the claim. If you suspect some of the assumptions that need to be true aren't true, you'll point out that the claim is weak. This is a large part of critical evaluation part of reading. For example if you're writing a review of the literature around a topic, you'll need to read many texts and construct a debate around the topic, arguing for a particular point of view. We often do this by grouping together authors who say the same thing and setting them in opposition to others, pointing out the relative strengths and weaknesses of each text. One of the main ways of deciding on the strengths and weaknesses of texts is to identify the claims, premises, and underlying assumptions.   [Slide 26: Close reading - Evaluate: Judging credibility]   Description:   [Text]    What is it that makes some knowledge claims more credible than others?   The reputation of the author of the claim  The context in which the claim was made  The evidence or reasons provided  The plausibility of the claim    [Example table - Claim]   Column 1. The sun will rise tomorrow: true   Column 2. Scientists have found evidence of life on Venus: false   Column 3. Red is my favourite colour: true or false   Narrator: This is not an exhaustive list , but it's a useful starting place. For instance, if you believe red to be my favourite colour, you could back it up by my reputation for not lying, or by corroboration from other sources, for instance noticing that most of my clothes are red, and I have a set of red folders on my desk.    [Slide 27 with the title: Close reading - Evaluate: Assumptions and Inferences]    Description:   [Text: Definitions]   Assumptions : Beliefs we take to be self-evident. They might be factual; they might not be.   Inferences: Conclusions we draw based on evidence or assumptions.   [Example]   Statement:   Tall men are good basketballer. James is a tall man, therefore James is a good basketballer.   Explanation:   We infer that James is a good basketballer because of our assumption that all tall men are good basketballers. However, our assumption is not valid, therefore our inference is poor.   Claim : James is a good basketballer   Premise: James is tall and tall men are good basketballers   Narrator: As mentioned, we look at the weight of evidence or we make assumptions to infer the truth of a claim. Here's an example of assumptions and inference and how they relate to claims and premises. Take some time to read it and decide if the premises support the claim. If you suspect some of the assumptions that need to be true AREN'T true, you would point out that the claim is weak. This is a large part of the critical evaluation part of reading. For example, if you're writing a review of the literature around a topic, you'll need to read many texts and construct a debate around the topic, arguing for a particular point of view. We often do this by grouping together authors who say the same thing and setting them in opposition of others, pointing out the relative strengths and weaknesses of each text. One of the main ways of deciding on the   strengths and weaknesses of texts is to identify the claims, premises, and underlying assumptions.    [Slide 27: Close reading - Evaluate: Assumptions and Inferences]    Description: Using what you\u2019ve found  How does the text contribute to the field \/ discipline?  How do other authors view this issue?  Are there opposing views? And, if so, how can I synthesis \/ reconcile these differences?

[emedia_video:videos\/Structuring-Umbreen.m4v transcript:transcripts\/Structuring-Umbreen.rtf image:videos\/Umbreen.png]  The structure of writing over here was very different. I found it a real struggle here because the expectation of the teachers was quite different from what was expected in my country. For example in our sub continent in India and Pakistan the way we are taught to structure our essays is we don't come to the point directly we have to develop this major build up, and before coming to the point so that unless and until we don't have that huge context coming to that point, our lecturer wouldn't think that we have put enough effort into that, so but over here the thing was to go bang! Go to the point directly. And then you can start explaining... &mdash; Umbreen  Structuring assignments     Direct linear approach: \"Here's the flower. Here's where I got it from. Now I will explain it...\"      Indirect inductive approach: \"Let me take you for a walk in the garden and I will show you something...\"  It is not common knowledge that the structure of written and oral texts is embedded in a particular culture's patterns of thinking, speaking and writing. For example, the academic style in Australian universities is linear and focuses on presenting the main point or thesis at the beginning, followed by supporting points leading to a conclusion. However, students from many cultures, particularly Asian cultures, can find this structure unsophisticated. They value a high-context, circular discourse style, where there is a detailed explanation of context before coming to the main point. This is an indirect and inductive style where digression is highly valued, a bit like peeling an onion.","excerpt":"nodeID: 807 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Your feedback needs to take into account that students from diverse cultural backgrounds may structure oral and written texts differently.

S1 Summation notation Summation notation, also known as sigma notation, is a shorthand method of writing the sum or addition of a string of similar terms. This module explains the use of this notation that is often used in the formulas for statistical calculations.   S2 Data Data is everywhere and increasingly drives many aspects of our day-to-day lives. Here we explain the different types of data that can be collected and some ways of illustrating this data.   S3 Mean, mode, median The mean, the median and the mode are three different measures of central tendency. This module shows the three different ways in which you can find a single number to summarise a set of data.   S4 Measures of spread The range, the interquartile range and the standard deviation are three different measures of the spread of a set of data. This module shows three different ways to calculate a number to represent the spread of a set of data.   S5 Probability rules This module covers the rules of basic probability, including the multiplication and addition principles and complementary events.   S6 Sample spaces A sample space is a list of all the possible outcomes. There are a number of techniques that can be used to list the sample space.   S7 Conditional probability If two events are not independent then the outcome of one event can change the probability of the second event occurring.   S8 Binomial probability The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution consisting of repeated trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes.   S9 Normal distribution The normal distribution is a \u201cbell-shaped\u201d, symmetrical, continuous probability distribution.   S10 Standard normal distribution A normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one is called the standard normal distribution. Areas under the standard normal distribution curve represent probabilities which can be found via a calculator or a \u201cz-table\u201d.   S11 Probability and the normal distribution In any normal distribution the mean and standard deviation can be used to convert it to a standard normal distribution and when can then compute probabilities.   S12 Sampling distributions Learn how we can sample distributions. The distribution of the means of all the possible samples of a certain size tend to follow a normal distribution.   S13 Confidence intervals We can use the mean of a sample to estimate the mean of the entire population. It is more appropriate to give an interval estimate rather than a point estimate.   S14 Hypothesis testing This module explains how to set up and test hypotheses to see if a difference between a sample mean and a population mean is significant.   S15 T-test Hypothesis testing usually uses the population standard deviation to calculate a \u201cz\u201d value. If the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation to calculate a \u201ct\u201d value.   S16 P-value Hypotheses can be tested by comparing the test statistic to the critical value or by comparing the p-value to the significance level, \u03b1.   S17 One sided tests How do we apply a test of proportions? Rather than comparing a sample mean to a population mean, we can compare a sample proportion to a population proportion.   S18 Tests of proportion Hypothesis tests can be either two-tailed (non-directional) suggesting that the sample mean is different to the population mean, or one-tailed (directional) suggesting that the sample mean is greater than (or alternatively, less than) the population mean.   S19 Poisson distribution The Poission Distribution deals with the number of random occurrences over a period of time (or distance or area or volume), such as the number of people who enter a shop every hour, or the number of flaws in a sheet of glass.

It is presented in the format of a bibliography or reference list.\nEvery unit may have its own specific requirements for an annotated bibliography such as the number and type of resources, the structure and referencing style, and the content that needs to be included. Therefore, it is important to first check the requirements of your assignment or assessment task.\nThis resource provides information on annotated bibliography from explaining its purpose and structure, to what to include in the content of an annotation, and a sample example.\nPurpose of an annotated bibliography\nRegardless of your unit of study, the purpose of an annotated bibliography is to:\n\n \tdevelop critical thinking skills by reviewing the issues and noting the main arguments in a particular research area.\n \tdevelop deeper research skills by engaging with individual sources.\n \tfind and reflect on the literature that has been published about your research topic.\n\nStructure of an annotated bibliography\nAn annotated bibliography includes two main sections:\n\n \ta reference (bibliographic information or citation).\n \tThe reference needs to be in accordance with the RMIT Referencing style. Refer to Referencing for more detail, examples and activities.\n \tan annotation (description and comments on the source).\n \tThe annotation section contains a summary or description, an evaluation of each source, and an indication of how that source contributes to your research topic.\n\nWriting an annotation\nTo write an annotated bibliography first check the assignment guide instructed by your lecturer. Depending on the requirements, an annotated bibliography may include one or all the components below:\n\n \tA summary or description of each of the information sources\n \tA critical analysis of each of the information sources\n \tA reflection of how each source contributes to the overall research topic\n\nWhat to include in a summary\nWhen writing an annotated bibliography, start with a summary or description for each source. As you read, take notes in your own words of the aim of the research, the methodologies that have been used, the main arguments and overall findings, and the scope and limitations of the study. This will form the basis of your summary which will be in the form of a coherent 50\u2013100-word paragraph or just two or three sentences.\nResources on Summarising provides tips, examples, and activities that will help develop your summarising skills.\nWhat to include in a critical analysis\nIf your assignment guide requires a critical analysis for annotated bibliography, you will need to focus on the value of the material and sources you are looking into. Consider asking yourself:\n\n \tWhat are the strengths and limitations of the source in terms of aim, methodology, and findings?\n \tAre the findings sound, logical and well researched?\n \tIs the source original, important and of a high standard?\n \tHow does this source add to the research in the field?\n \tWhere is its place \u2014 and relationship \u2014 in the wider field of research and scholarly discussions?\n\nTutorials on Developing a critical approach and Critical reading can help you develop your critical analysis skills.\nWhat to include in a reflection\nWriting a reflection for your annotated bibliography includes writing a few sentences explaining why or why not the source is useful or helpful for your research or how it relates to the overall theme of your research.\nWhile reflective writing is stating your personal ideas and evaluations, it should still be objective and unemotional. Tutorials on Writing an academic reflection can help you practice writing better reflections for annotated bibliographies.\nActivity\nLook at this example of an annotated bibliography.

Let's find out how to make a strong start.\r\nStarting a group project is the same as starting an individual project. You will need to:\r\n\r\n \tanalyse the task\r\n \tdetermine what needs to be done\r\n \tcreate a plan for completing the task.\r\n\r\nIt is important to establish good working relationships at the beginning, with protocols and agreements for communication, behaviour and responsibilities. Good communication is especially important for online groups.\r\nStrategy 1: Analyse the task as a group\r\n\r\n \tAgree on what the task is asking you to do. Review the task instructions, marking criteria\/rubric and any other information you have.\r\n \tIdentify if the task has to be completed in a particular order (e.g. parts 3 or 4 rely on work done for parts 1 and 2). This determines how you might plan your timeline and delegate responsibilities for completing the assignment. If your group has any questions about the task, contact your lecturer as soon as possible. Check out Starting my first assignment and for more advice on planning.\r\n\r\nStrategy 2: Create a timeline\r\n\r\n \tAssess the time required for a group assignment. Groups often underestimate how long an assignment may take. A timeline identifies key milestones and helps you manage the workload to meet deadlines. Be realistic and be prepared to adapt your timeline as you progress. Members of online groups may be working in different time zones. Factor this into your timeline.\r\n \tInclude enough time for research. Your research will be a large part of the task. You may also need to allow time for additional research during the drafting\/production stage of the task.\r\n \tAllow time for drafting and producing the final product.

Good communication is an advantage for any group.   Strategy 1: Agree how to work together  Write a group charter to outline how you will work together, what expectations members have (\"Let's aim for an HD\") and how you will approach the task. Group members need to agree on the charter and sign it.

To meet the task requirements, group members will be busy with different responsibilities at the same time. Focus on communicating and collaborating to successfully manage yourselves and the task.  [tabs type=\"tabs\"] [tab title=\"Managing the group\" active=\"true\"]   Strategy 1: Hold regular meetings  Use an agenda to keep meetings focussed on the task.    Actively contribute to discussions using inclusive and respectful language.    Be open to different ideas and different perspectives.    Ensure everyone has a say. Sometimes people find it difficult to voice their opinions. They may feel dominated by more confident speakers. Listen when others are speaking and encourage the quiet members to contribute.    Check and measure progress against the timeline.  Meetings are an opportunity for the group to reconnect, review progress, provide feedback and make any necessary changes.    Strategy 2: Give each other constructive feedback  Give positive feedback to motivate and encourage team members. Always start with genuine, positive feedback: say what you appreciate about their work before offering critical feedback. Be sensitive to how others may respond to criticism. Be nice.    Use the S.M.A.R.T. principles to focus your feedback on the task:      Specific Focus on actual examples of the work or performance. General or vague statements are unhelpful.    Motivating Give reasons to continue or change behaviour. Why is it important or useful?    Action-oriented Align actions with the task requirements. If a change is required, what needs to happen?    Realistic Is the change something that the person can do? Do they need help? Who is going to help them?    Timely Provide feedback when it is requested or required. Waiting until the end of the task may affect everyone in the group and could allow a small problem to escalate.       Strategy 3: Deal with challenging behaviours and conflict   Which group member are you?   Zombie Unengaged and unmotivated. May 'disappear' for weeks or completely.

A group of one!    Identify and acknowledge any conflict or dissatisfaction early. Disagreements arise when members lack clear directions or feel their knowledge and skills are ignored or criticised.  Communicate any problems to the whole group and try to resolve the problem quickly, as a group. You will need to negotiate and compromise.  The diagram below shows how issues can often build upon one another. Manage group dynamics  Groups are made up of people with different expectations. For example, some students are happy just to pass while others aim for high marks. Sometimes these differences can cause tension. This is normal &ndash;&nbsp;all groups experience highs and lows when working on complex projects over a period of time. Do you recognise any of these people and their behaviours and attitudes in your group?  You are always going to encounter diversity within groups.

Record decisions for actions, roles and responsibilities to provide clear direction to group members.   Measure agenda actions against the timeline to help the team stay on track. Be prepared to adjust the timeline as the project progresses.    Strategy 2: Manage tasks and resources  Organise information so that it is shareable and accessible to everyone.

This branch of maths is fundamental to physics and engineering to represent physical quantities that have a direction.\u00a0 Use these measurement worksheets to improve your skills in these areas. The University of Colorado has some useful vector simulations, so come back and have a look at those once you've used the worksheets below.  V1 Introduction to vectors This page Introduces the basic concepts around vectors (which are measurable quantities with direction such as force). It introduces the concept of a scalar (which is a quantity without a direction such as heat or thermal energy).  It covers vector components (aligned along the horizontal and vertical or the 3-dimensional axes), unit vectors (a vector of size = 1), vector magnitude (or size) and how to add and subtract vectors.   V2 Resolution of vectors Vector quantities in combination will enhance or counteract each other, depending on their direction. An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.  This task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics.  V3 Scalar product What is a scalar product? What is a dot product? This is the result of multiplying the magnitudes of the components of two or more vectors. The result is not a vector, but a scalar (which is without direction).   V4 Vector product What is a vector product? What is a cross product? The vector product is a vector that is the result of multiplying the magnitudes (size) of two vectors. The magnitude is found using matrices and determinants).  The result of the cross product is another vector, and the direction is perpendicular (normal, at 90 degrees) to the plane of both the original vectors.   V5 Projection of vectors In \u2019Resolution of vectors\u2019 we learned how to resolve vectors in two dimensions along horizontal and vertical axes. It is also possible to resolve one vector along the line of another vector (instead of along the x-y axes).  Learn how to find the projection (resolution) of one vector in the direction of a second vector.   V6 Vector equation of a line If you want to uniquely define a line, you need to pin it between two points in 3-dimensional space. You can also define a point with a 3-dimensional vector through it. This process uses three types of equations.  Learn how to find the vector equation, the parametric equation, and the symmetric equation of a line in three-dimensional space.   V7 Intersecting lines in 3D Learn how to determine if two lines in three dimensions intersect (cross each other) and, if so, what is their point of intersection?  V8 Equation of a plane Learn how to find the equation of a plane (a 2-dimensional space):  a) through three points or  b) given a normal (line at right angles) and a point on the plane or  c) given a parallel plane and a point on the plane.  V9 Intersecting planes Two 2-dimensional planes will slice through each other (unless they are parallel). Where they slice will be defined by a straight line. There will also be an angle between the two planes.  Learn how to determine the angle between two intersecting planes and the equation of the line of intersection.  V10 Distance from a point to a plane The shortest distance from some point in the air down to flat ground, is defined by a line straight down, sitting at right angles to the ground.  Learn how to find the perpendicular (right angle) distance from a point to a plane.   V11 Directional derivatives If you are on the side of a hill, the gradient depends on the direction you look. So the directional derivative is the gradient in a particular direction.  Learn how to find the directional derivative of a function of two variables f(x,y) or three variables g(x,y,z) at a point and in a given direction. This is very useful in engineering and especially computer graphics.

The executive summary\/abstract is generally written last. This allows you to summarise all the major areas of the report. Example   The aim of this report was to investigate university teaching staff attitudes to the use of mobile phones by students in tutorials. A survey of teaching staff from each college was conducted in first semester of the academic year. Overall, the results indicate that the majority of staff found student mobile devices use a major disruption in tutorials. The report concludes that the predominant view of staff is that mobile phones are disruptive and should be turned off during tutorials. It is recommended that the university develops guidelines which would support staff in the restriction of student use of mobile phones in tutorials except in exceptional circumstances.

It should give the reader all the information required to understand the importance and relevance of the report. It should clearly state:  the context of the report the purpose of the report    There has been a great increase in the use of personal mobile phones over the past five years with every indication that this usage will continue to increase. Indeed, widespread use of mobile devices in educational contexts for non educational purposes has been reported as distracting and disruptive to learning environments. Recently a number of university teaching staff have proposed that an institution wide policy be developed regarding student mobile phone use during tutorials and lectures. This report will discuss research into staff attitudes to the issue of student mobile phone usage in the teaching and learning environment.

Many other cultures prefer a logical structure that requires in-depth elaboration and context before arriving at the main point.   Assignments in Australian universities (for example, essays, reports or oral presentations) require a more linear structure. This means the main ideas are introduced at the beginning, and are followed by a point-by-point elaboration of the key points leading to a conclusion at the end.     Linear style Explicit Deductive Direct       Introduction &rarr; Introduce the main idea Key point 1 (develop &amp; elaborate) &darr; Key point 2 (develop &amp; elaborate) &darr; Key point 3 (develop &amp; elaborate) &darr; Key point 4 (develop &amp; elaborate) &darr; Conclusion No irrelevant information Limited contextual information   Different structures for organising information in an assignment There are two common structures for organising ideas. These are based on different logical structures and vary according to cultural and linguistic backgrounds. These two different ways of structuring writing and presentations can be represented by two approaches to a walk in the garden.    Model 1: Direct linear approach Model 2: Explanation before getting to the main point    Model 1 is a simple representation of the approach to organising material in the Australian educational context. In Model 1, the student is expected to present the main point first, followed by explanation and analysis.  Here's the flower. These are the main points.   Model 2&nbsp;is another representation of what is common in many other cultures. In this model the student builds a case through background information, explanation and analysis and finally presents the main point.  Here's the garden. Let me take you for a walk and I'll show you something...     Conclusion &ndash; How to get good marks! Many students don't realise how important the linear structure is for achieving good marks in Australian universities.

In some cultures, being critical is considered unpleasant and even disrespectful. However, in tertiary study critical thinking is an important skill to develop. Critical thinking is about asking questions and then making evaluations or judgments and is fundamental to tertiary study. This is also called critical analysis. Often when students first enrol at university they are more familiar with summarising or describing information and ideas. However, as part of a tertiary program students are expected to develop a critical approach to their study. Why is critical thinking challenging? Critical thinking is a skill, which is difficult for all students. This is because students are required to develop their own judgments or views of published authors. This questioning approach may be considered disrespectful of the knowledge of published authors in some cultures. A critical approach demonstrates that the student has thought deeply about the topic.    Steps in critical thinking Analysing &rarr; By asking questions of the material you are studying &darr;  Making judgments\/evaluations to &darr;  Developing your own position\/argument Based on your readings, lectures, tutorials etc. in your assignments.   For example An essay task, which starts: Compare the theories of Author. X and Author. Y ... This task is asking the student to examine the similarities and differences between the theories of Author X and author Y and then to judge or evaluate them. Based on evidence students are required to develop their own analysis\/ideas about the ideas of others. It is not good enough to just summarise the theories of each author because this does not show that you can evaluate them.

These verbs are often used with prepositions, e.g. by, on, for, about. It is poor writing to use the same ones all the time, e.g. says that, states that. Verbs also allow the writer to indicate the degree to which they support the author of the research, e.g. claims that versus argues that. The following verbs (and prepositions) can be used to introduce references into your literature review. Please note that they can be used in different tenses.    Suggest (that) Recent studies outlined by Leonard et al. (1999) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Argue (that) Leonard et al. (1999) argue that there are three element of self perception.   Contend(s) Mullens (1994) contends that motivation to well is usually related to job satisfaction.   Outline Recent studies outlined by Mullins (1994) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Focus on The early theories of Maslow and McGregor (cited in Robbins et al. 1998) focused on personal needs and wants as the basis for motivation.   Define(s) Eunson (1987, p. 67) defines motivation as 'what is important to you'.   Conclude(s) that Reviewing the results of the case study, Taylor (1980) concludes that the theories of job enrichment and employee motivation do work.   State He further states that there is an increasing importance on the role of autonomy and self regulation of tasks in increasing motivation.   Maintains (that) Mullins (1994) maintains that job enrichmnent came from Herzber's two factor theory.   Found (that) Mullins (1994) found that there is an increasing importance on the role of autonomy and self regulation of tasks in improving motivation.   Promote(s) This promotes the idea that tension and stress are important external sources of motivation, which can be eliminated by completing certain tasks.   Establish(ed) (by) As established by Csikszentmihalyi (cited in Yair 2000, p.2) 'the more students feel in command of their learning, the more they fulfill their learning potential'.   Asserts (that) Locke's Goal Setting Theory asserts that setting specific goals tends to encourage work motivation (Robbins et al.&nbsp;1998).   Show(s) Various theories of motivation show employers that here are many factors that influence employees work performance.   Claim(s) (that) Hackman and Oldham (1975) claim that people with enriched jobs, and high scores on the Job Diagnostic Survey, experienced more satisfaction and motivation.   Report(s) Mullins (1994) reports on four content theories of motivation.   Mention(s) Mullins (1994) mentions two common general criticisms of Herzberg's theory.   Address Redesigning jobs so that responsibility moved from supervisors to the workers, was an attempt to address the issues of job satisfaction (Mullins 1994).

Learn more about paraphrasing here.\n\nKeywords(tags): APA, Paraphrasing, Plagiarism, Referencing\n\n\n\nParaphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas and put them in your own words. Even though you are not using the original author's exact words, you must still cite the source. Paraphrasing and summarising ideas from the literature is preferable to quotes. By presenting the information in your own words, you demonstrate your understanding of the material that you have read. Steps for paraphrasing  Read the original text. Write down your version of it, changing the keywords and structure of the sentence(s). It is best to close the book so you do not copy word-for-word. It is important that the sentence structure and the vocabulary are different from the original. Complete citation process. Page numbers are generally not given in paraphrases.  Citing a paraphrase Paraphrases are cited in a similar way to quotes, but generally do not include page numbers. Referencing details can be placed at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the citation. Reference at the beginning Cottrell (2008) noted that the skills students use when researching assignments can vary depending on their academic discipline and level of study. Reference in the middle The skills used by students when selecting references for assignments can vary depending on their academic discipline and level of study (Cottrell, 2008), but all students should develop a systematic approach to this task. Reference at the end Students need to develop a systematic approach to locating appropriate sources of information for use in assignment work, but the skills used can vary depending on the academic discipline and level of study (Cottrell, 2008).  For further information go to the Paraphrasing tutorial. Using multiple sources In academic writing, arguments are developed through discussing and critiquing what authorities or experts have already written\/said about the topic. It is, therefore, important to be able to use multiple sources in your work. However, you must acknowledge where your ideas have come from through using paraphrases or quotes. Remember, all authors need to be cited otherwise it is considered plagiarism.","excerpt":"nodeID: 232 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas and put them in your own words.

Synthesising is an important and complex skill required in academic writing. Synthesising involves combining ideas from a range of sources in order to group and present common ideas or arguments. It is a necessary skill used in essays, literature reviews and other forms of academic writing. Unlike summarising and paraphrasing, which only uses one author's ideas at a time, synthesising combines ideas from more than one text or source. Synthesising allows you to:  combine information and ideas from multiple sources to develop and strengthen your argument(s) demonstrate that you have read widely on the topic use and cite multiple sources.   How to synthesise Use the following steps to synthesise information from different sources.  Read relevant material. Make brief notes using keypoints\/keywords. This makes it easier to compare and contrast relevant information. Identify common ideas. Cite (reference) all the authors you have used.   Note-taking for synthesising Write down the main points. Remember to cite the references. Topic: English is the dominant world language   Text 1 (Watson 2019)   international language for business used for international forums (e.g.&nbsp;UN) second language in many countries      Text 2 (Lui 2018)   used in worldwide technology computers key factor in spread of English internationalisation of education      Text 3 (Hannan 2017)   small number of speakers worldwide importance of English linked to US power, i.e. 'Political' more people speak Chinese worldwide      Text 4 (Dowd 2019)   minority of speakers in world Chinese dominant especially in future English will decline in future     Writing a synthesis from notes Look at your notes and identify similar and contradictory arguments. Group these together to develop\/support your arguments. Cite references appropriately.  Supporting the contention that English is the dominant world language, Watson (2019) and Lui (2018) point out its importance as the medium of international communication in business, technology and other global forums. However, others argue that despite its apparent dominance, English is not the global language when the number of native speakers of other languages, for example Chinese, are considered (Dowd 2019; Hannan 2017).  Supporting ideas of Watson and Lui Reference citations Weaving together similar ideas that contradict the previous statement    Legend  'Support': supporting ideas of Watson and Lui 'Reference': reference citations  'Similiarity': weaving similiar ideas that contradict the previous statement   Paragraph [Support: Supporting the contention that English is the dominant world language], [reference: Watson (2019) and Lui (2018)] [Support: point out its importance as the medium of international communication in business, technology and other global forums.] [Similiarity: However, others argue that despite its apparent dominance, English is not the global language when the number of native speakers of other languages, for example Chinese, are considered] [Reference:&nbsp;(Dowd 2019; Hannan 2017).]  Example In the example below, notice the way the writer has organised and referenced information from multiple sources. Several authors' ideas on extroversion are grouped in  pink and the other authors' ideas on introversion are grouped in blue. References are in orange.    Individuals are classified as either an extrovert or an introvert. Extroversion describes people who are outgoing, sociable, assertive, and optimistic and are in search of excitement (McAdams 2014;&nbsp;McShane and Travaglione 2015). Extroverts are confident in their abilities to accomplish tasks effectively and have faith in themselves. They enjoy risk taking, but can be unreliable and can lose their temper easily (Mathews, Deary and Whiteman 2013). Extroverts also focus more on the positive aspects and outcomes of life and therefore they have a greater level of self confidence. On the other hand, introverts are described as being shy, quiet, withdrawn, less likely to make bad impulsive decisions and are more cautious in their actions (Matthews, Deary and Whiteman 2013; McAdams 2014; McShane and Traviglione 2015). As a consequence, introverts are more likely to place weight on the negative outcomes and aspects of social situations (McAdams 2014) and prefer to be alone, whereas extroverts have the ability to make friends quickly.   Legend  'Extroversion': Several authors' ideas on extroversion are grouped 'Introversion': Other authors' ideas on introversion are grouped 'Reference': References made  Paragraph Individuals are classified as either an extrovert or an introvert. [Extroversion: Extroversion describes people who are outgoing, sociable, assertive, and optimistic and are in search of excitement] [Reference: (McShane and Travaglione 2015; McAdams 2014).

Authority  Who conducted the research? Is the author an authority in their field of study? What evidence is there to support this? Research can find information from many sources, e.g. volumed journals to company reports. At all times, you must check the authority of who has written the research. The internet has given people access to huge amounts of information. Some of this is valid, other parts are not. You cannot simply accept that all information\/research available on the internet, e.g. through Google, is valid. Many university libraries, such as the RMIT library, subscribe to online, referenced journals, which provide current academic writings. Google is a great source of information, though you may be cautious in using this approach for all your research. The Learning Lab's page \"Why can't I just Google it?\" has more.  Validity (of research and sources)  Where has this research come from? Is it from a valid source, e.g. an educational institution? Is it peer reviewed or been passed by an editorial panel, e.g. is it in a refereed journal? If it is from a website, does it contain details of the author, is it from an '.edu' site, does it have a publication date?  Many libraries, including the RMIT library, have access to electronic journals and databases. These contain qualified, academic writings. Be careful of doing a google search that brings up unqualified sites. Accuracy  What is the literature about? Is the literature accurate and how do you know? One way to find out is to check if the same research is referred to in other sources, or is it inconsistent with other findings? What makes the literature believable? Is the literature from credible sources?  Objectivity  Is there evidence of bias in the article? For example, would you trust research from a cigarette manufacturer claiming that smoking does not damage your health? Do the statistics match those in other publications? If not, is the argument (method, research design, etc.) on which they are based convincing? How do you know the data is true? What other supporting data is there?  Currency  What is the publication date of the material? Is it likely that more current information is available? Have you found any more recent research that casts doubt upon or refutes some findings? Have you checked for more recent information\/research? It is advisable to have references that are current.  Coverage  Is the information complete? Based on your research so far, does the information appear to cover the area being studied? What is the sample size? Is it adequate? Is there any further research that has not been mentioned or deliberately omitted from the findings?  Location  In which country was the article written? Is the location relevant\/important to your research?  Final check When you have considered all the questions above, ask yourself:  What does this all mean?

Reporting words It is important to use suitable reporting words to introduce your references. Reporting words all have different meanings so it is important to use a word that suits the meaning of the sentence. In the example notice how the reporting word 'predicts' is used to indicate the future so that it fits into the meaning of this sentence.  Jones (2011:23) predicts that '... income from Australian mining exports is likely to continue to increase in the next two years'. Examples of reporting words Notice the use of different meanings of the reporting words.    Suggest (that) Recent studies outlined by Leonard et al. (1999) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Argue (that) Leonard et al. (1999) argue that there are three elements of self perception.   Contend(s) Mullens (1994) contends that motivation to work well is usually related to job satisfaction.   Outline Recent studies outlined by Mullins (1994) suggest that personality and disposition play an equally important role in motivation.   Focus on The early theories of Maslow and McGregor (Robbins et al. 1998) focused on personal needs and wants as the basis for motivation.   Define(s) Eunson (1987:67) defines motivation as 'what is important to you'.   Conclude(s) (that) Reviewing the results of the case study, Taylor (1980) concludes that the theories of job enrichment and employee motivation do work.   State He further states that there is an increasing importance on the role of autonomy and self regulation of tasks in increasing motivation.   Maintains (that) Mullins (1994) maintains that job enrichment came from Herzber's two factor theory.   Found (that) Mullins (1994) found that there is an increasing importance on the role of autonomy and self regulation of tasks in improving motivation.   Promote(s) This promotes the idea that tension and stress are important on the role of autonomy and self regulation of tasks in improving motivation.   Establish(ed) (by) As established by Csikszentmihalyi (cited in Yair 2000:2) 'the more students feel in command of their learning, the more they fulfil their learning potential'.   Asserts (that) Locke's Goal Setting Theory asserts that setting specific goals tends to encourage work motivation (Robbins et al. 1998).   Show(s) Various theories of motivation show employers that there are many factors that influence employees work performance.   Claim(s) (that) Hackman and Oldham (1975) claim that people with enriched jobs, and high scores on the Job Diagnostic Survey, experienced more satisfaction and motivation.   Report(s) Mullins (1994) reports on four content theories of motivation.   Mention(s) Mullins (1994) mentions two common general criticisms of Herzberg's theory.   Address Redesigning jobs so that responsibility moved from supervisors to the workers, was an attempt to address the issues of job satisfaction (Mullins&nbsp;1994)    Another useful strategy for integrating references into your writing is to use suitable linking words.

Revision strategies Just reading is too passive. Your understanding and ability to recall information will improve if you study more actively. If you actively use what you have read or heard, you will find it much easier to remember and understand in the future.

So, don't just read&mdash;write notes, talk, listen and make sure what you have seen or heard is learned.  How to make revision more 'active'    Write summaries and use mind maps  File your lectures, essays, research under topics. Write bullet point summaries of each topic&mdash;use notes from lectures, tutorials, reading and assignment materials. Further reduce your notes using highlighting. Rewrite you notes as mind maps&mdash;note key ideas and supporting examples or evidence.

Writing checklist Use the following criteria as guidelines for your literature review. Traps to avoid in the literature review  Don't try to read everything, be selective. Reading but not writing. Not keeping bibliographical information. Incomplete referencing (paraphrases, summaries and direct quotes).  What makes a good literature review?  The selection of literature chosen for review. The criticism of the literature. The interpretation of the literature.  Selection of literature  Have you read widely? Is the purpose of the review clearly identified? Does your writing include clear definitions and identify the limits of the research? Does the review focus on the most recent developments\/research for that topic? Does the review make use of the primary sources?  Criticism of the literature  Is there a logical flow to your writing? Is the structure of your review clearly stated? Have you demonstrated that you have read widely as well as focused on your specific topic of research? Have you focused on current\/most relevant issues?  Interpretation  Have you interpreted\/evaluated what you have read? Is there an obvious gap in the research\/literature? Have you used the literature to create your own interpretation of the research?  Key assessment criteria  What the student has read. How the student has organised the review\/writing of this. How the student has interpreted and evaluated this.

A survey of teaching staff from each college was conducted in first semester of the academic year.  Overall, the results indicate that the majority of staff found student mobile devices use a major disruption in tutorials. The report concludes that the predominant view of staff is that mobile phones are disruptive and should be turned off during tutorials. It is recommended that the university develops guidelines which would support staff in the restriction of student use of mobile phones in tutorials except in exceptional circumstances.       Introduction     ContextPurpose   There has been a great increase in the use of personal mobile phones over the past five years with every indication that this usage will continue to increase. Indeed, widespread use of mobile devices in educational contexts for non educational purposes has been reported as distracting and disruptive to learning environments. Recently a number of university teaching staff have proposed that an institution wide policy be developed regarding student mobile phone use during tutorials and lectures. This report will discuss research into staff attitudes to the issue of student mobile phone usage in the teaching and learning environment.       Method    Refer to relevant reading\/literatureDescribe how the research was done  The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009). This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated university teaching staff attitudes to the use of mobile phones in tutorials (see Appendix 1). The questionnaire used Likert scales to assess social attitudes (Jones 2007) to student mobile phone use and provided open ended responses for additional comments. The survey was voluntary and anonymous. A total of 412 questionnaires were distributed online to randomly selected staff from each of the three colleges within the university. The completed questionnaires were returned by email.       Check your course guide for appropriate referencing style.       Results     Facts only- no interpretation.   There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to staff. The results clearly show that student mobile phones are considered by teaching staff to be disruptive (see Table 1). As a result, most staff would prefer that mobile phones were turned off in tutorials.       Table 1     Tables must be referred to in the text        Discussion     Discuss and interpret the meaning of the results Integrate different findings to create meaning Link results to other research  It is evident from the results in Table 1 that student mobile phone use in tutorials is considered to be a significant problem; however it was acknowledged that in some cases it should be permissible. Given that such high numbers of teaching staff (85 %) consider that student mobile phone usage in tutorials is a problem, clearly this is a teaching issue that needs to be addressed. Further, while the findings acknowledge a place for mobile phones in exceptional circumstances (62%) it would appear that a policy is required to make explicit acceptable guidelines for their usage.  These findings are consistent with a number of other studies. According to Smith (2009) many educational institutions have identified mobile phones as disruptive to learning.Watts(2010) also claims that up to 30% of tutorial time is wasted through unnecessary phone interruptions. Other similar research shows &hellip;. Another significant finding of this study was that 80% of respondents found mobile phones distracted from the learning environment. This result differs from other similar studies. According to Lau (2011), staff were increasingly using mobile technologies in tutorials and saw them as a valuable addition to the classroom. Further to this, mobile technology has the potential to become a critical tool for teaching (Bond 2010). This difference suggests that the technology can be used effectively if it is integral to the learning process. However, if it is used as a distracting social tool in a tutorial, control of its use is justified.       For Results and Discussion develop headings appropriate for your content       Conclusion     Summary of main findings and 'the answer'   The student use of mobile phones in tutorials is clearly intrusive to teaching staff and detrimental to learning environments in general. The study highlights the concerns of teaching staff with regard to mobile phone usage. The fact that the majority of staff views the student use of mobile phones in tutorials as disruptive suggests appropriate guidelines and policies need to be developed.       Recommendations     Suggest possible changes\/solutions. Point form can be used.   It is recommended that the university develops official guidelines regarding the use of mobile phones in tutorials. The guidelines should recommend that:  teaching staff have the right to restrict mobile phone usage according to their discretion mobile phones may only be used by students in exceptional circumstances.  Finally, the guidelines need to be university wide and clearly communicated to all staff and students.     Attachments   Appendices       Use point form for lists. Check your course guide.

When citing multiple authors, use an '&amp;' to separate them in the in-text citation, and an 'and' in the body of the text. Direct quotes Direct quotes show where another person's original thoughts, words, ideas, images etc. have been used directly in someone else's work. Direct quotes should be used sparingly, particularly longer quotes (see below). If you use too many, you are simply reporting information that you have found. Paraphrases, on the other hand, require you to rewrite the reference in your own words showing that you have really understood the ideas or issues. Direct quotes (short) Follow these steps to use direct quotes in your assignments.  Copy the exact words from the original source. Use quotation marks \" \" at the beginning and end of the copied text. Reference the author, year and page number information.  Example Plagiarism issues are an area of confusion for many students beginning university, resulting in \"many misunderstandings, which coincide with high levels of unintentional plagiarism, bogus referencing and collusion\" (Pettigrew, 2010, p. 97). Long direct quotes (block quotes) For citations of 40 words or more, block quotes should be used. A block quote is indented, written on a new line and double-spaced. It does not have quotation marks around it. Note: With block quotations, any required source details are given in parentheses.  Examples The following examples show you how to insert a direct quote into your writing. Reference at the beginning of a sentence Lorenzi et al.

Only 5-7 pieces of information can be remembered at one time. This limited capacity of the long-term memory to absorb information to be stored is known as the bottleneck problem. In practical terms this means for example, that after reading a chapter of a text book, only 5-7 pieces of information can be effectively remembered and everything else will be forgotten. Chunking is a very useful technique for getting around the bottleneck problem. This means organising many smaller bits of information into fewer, larger bits.

Unlike a paraphrase, which is generally of a similar length to the original text, a summary is much shorter. When either summarising or paraphrasing, you should not alter:  the author's original idea(s) the degree of certainty with which the ideas are expressed.  Referencing Summaries need to be referenced. Whether you have summarised or paraphrased an author's words, thoughts, ideas etc, a citation to the original source of the words, thoughts, ideas etc must be provided. Further information Paraphrasing (link) To create \/ write a good summary, you should read the article or text a number of times to develop a clear understanding of:  the author's ideas and intentions the meaning and details the force with which the ideas are expressed.   How to write a summary Use the following steps to write a summary. Step 1  write notes in point form using keywords; this will make it easier to express the ideas in your own words.  Step 2   Write the summary directly from your notes without re-reading the passage.   Step 3  Refer back to the original to ensure that your summary is a true reflection of the writer's ideas.  Tips  Topic sentences provide a quick outline of the main idea(s) presented in a paragraph. When summarising a chapter or article, the introduction and conclusion should provide a good overview of the content.  Example (7A-highlighted text) Time management is a critical skill for all students to develop. Weekly and semester timetables are an excellent way to plan a study program. Students can use them to manage their most important study, work and social commitments and to set themselves study goals. Blocks of time can then be set aside for study, reading, researching and writing. The most urgent tasks can be addressed, whilst work continues on preparing for lectures, tutorials and asignments. If time has been allocated for specific purposes, it is easier to avoid unexpected demands like phone calls, visitors and invitations. Assignments can be completed and submitted on time and to a satisfactory standard. Summary: Effective time management allows students to utilise their time in order to successfully complete their study requirements.","excerpt":"nodeID: 171 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: A summary is a short and concise representation of the main points, ideas, concepts, facts or statements of a text written in your own words.

What is a literature review? In many university courses, students need to write literature reviews as part of their studies. A literature review is:  a review of writings, or literature, on a particular subject\/topic a review of the most relevant, recent and scholarly work in the subject\/topic area a piece of writing that supports, evaluates and critiques your research topic.  A literature review is not:  a summary of articles, texts or journals; or an analytical, opinionative or argumentative essay.  The purpose of a literature review is to:  establish a&nbsp;theoretical framework for your topic\/subject area define key terms, definitions and terminology identify studies, models, case studies, etc., supporting your topic define\/establish your area of study, i.e. your research topic.  The three key points of a literature review are:  what the research says (theory) how the research was carried out (methodology) what is missing, i.e. the gap that your research intends to fill.  The next step in planning your literature review is to read and research.

Exam management strategies There are two parts to managing exams:  regular revision throughout the year exam techniques.  By planning ahead - from the beginning of the year or semester - you can maximise the effectiveness of your study and revision time.  Regular revision What is revision? Revision is going over material you already know and understand.&nbsp; Revision should not be desperately trying to learn something for the first time in the week before the exam.&nbsp;If you have reviewed your learning through the semester and studied consistently, you will be in a much better position to do well in the exams. When should I start revising? Revision begins in the first week of the semester.&nbsp; Topics are presented logically and sequentially so you need to build on your knowledge and understanding throughout the semester. Use a semester planner (PDF 5.0MB) Examples of regular revision are:  reading of required texts revising after each lecture summarising your notes developing a weekly study timetable establishing regular study habits.   Time management Independent study As a tertiary student a large part of your learning happens outside lectures, tutorials and classes. Below is the amount of time you should be spending on independent study for each course\/subject, each week.  If you are a TAFE student: One hour for every face-to-face hour. If you are an HE student: 8-12 hours on each course each week. If you are a PG student: 14 hours on each course each week.   What is meant by independent study? Independent study activities include:  doing the required reading before lectures reviewing lecture notes at the end of each week summarising the key points reading recommended texts and more widely.  It is vital you learn to manage your time effectively. Use the following time management strategies to improve your study and revision.  Create study and revision timetables. Set specific goals for each study hour. Take small regular breaks. Vary your study activities and topics.

It may change like the variable, (both doubling) or it may change more, or less. Differentiation means finding the derivative of an expression. This means you are finding a rate of change for a variable. It expresses the slope of the curve.  The derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. If you map the profit of a company over time, the derivative will tell you if the company is getting stronger, levelling off or heading backwards.  Review these sections to learn about this field of mathematics   D1 Limit of a function The limit of a function means finding the value of a curve at a particular point. But what is that point? A value to many decimal places can be very long, to define a value that is very precise. The precise point can be infinitely small.  We can only ask what the value of the curve is as we get closer to that point, from values above and from values below. That is what we mean by approaching the limit.   D2 Gradients, tangents and derivatives A tangent is a line that touches a curve at only one point. Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point. (See also Functions and graphs)  A derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.   D3 Differentiation from first principles Learn how to take a derivative of a function using first principles. Using this method is the best way to understand the concepts around differentiation. Start here to really appreciate what you are doing when you differentiate, before you start differentiating using other methods in later modules.  D4 Rules for differentiation Learn about the rules for differentiation and the different notations that are used. This section includes algebraic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric examples.   D5 The chain rule How do you differentiate a larger function that has components that are smaller functions? This module will show you how to package these functions and work them out separately, before plugging them into the Chain Rule formula.   D6 The product rule What is the product rule? It is useful when you want to differentiate a function that comprises one function multiplied by another function.\u00a0  D7 Quotient rule What is the quotient rule? The quotient rule is like the product rule but this time it is for one function that is divided by another (rather than multiplied).  Review this section to learn how to differentiate using the quotient rule.   D8 Maxima and minima How do you find the maximum (highest) or minimum (lowest) value of a curve? The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent. If you go looking for the horizontal tangents (i.e. where the derivative = 0), you will be able to pinpoint the maxima or minima of a curve.   D9 Curve sketching If you find some key points of a function such as: maxima, minima, or turning points; x and y axis intercepts; and regions where the gradient is positive or negative, you can put together a sketch of a curve. Read this section to find examples of this being done.   D10 Rates of change If there is a relationship between two or more variables (like, area and radius of a circle (A = \u03c0r2 ), or pressure, volume and temperature of a gas), then there will also be a relationship between how these variables change. You may need to find how fast one variable changes in relation to another variable that is changing. This is called the rate of change.  This page presents such examples to help you turn a worded question into a mathematical solution.   D11 Small changes and approximations Sometimes a small change in one variable can render a big change in a larger value. For example, a small increase (or error) in the radius of a sphere means a lot more volume is added!  If you estimate the small error in one variable, you can calculate the significant change in a larger variable by using derivatives.  D12 Implicit differentiation What is implicit differentiation? How do you differentiate a function (say y=) that has two different variables in it (say x and k)? What do you do when you cannot express one as a function of the other? The technique of implicit differentiation is then useful.  Implicit differentiation enables you to find the derivative of y with respect to x without having to solve the original equation for y (see also Rearranging formula). Implicit differentiation may require using the Chain rule and Product Rule together. Read this sheet for some worked examples and exercises in this process.   D13 Partial differentiation What is partial differentiation? You may have an expression with 3 variables or more. The volume (V) of a cylinder for example depends on radius(r.) and height(h).  It makes it easier to hold one value as constant and differentiate with respect to the other two. This helps us to see how the change in one impacts the change in the other, without being muddled by the third variable.

Ancient builders and mariners used it for finding lengths that are not physically measurable (because they were so large) but they could be defined by angles.  Trigonometry has applications in fields such as engineering, surveying, navigation, optics, electronics, aviation, and cosmology in finding distances between stars and planets.  T1 Pythagoras\u2019 theorem Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem shows the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Knowing the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, the length of the third side can be calculated. This mathematical formula is fundamental for finding lengths and distances that are difficult to physically measure.   T2 Right triangle trigonometry Sine, cos and tan can be defined using side lengths of a right-angled triangle. These side lengths are identified as either the hypotenuse or the opposite or adjacent sides to the angle. This module shows how to apply trigonometric ratios to find a missing side length, or angle, in a right-angled triangle.   T3 The sine rule How can we apply trigonometry to triangles that do not possess a right-angle? The sine rule shows that the ratio of the length of a side, to the sine of its opposite angle, will be the same for all three sides.   T4 Cosine rule The cosine rule is a generalisation of Pythagoras\u2019 theorem. If you have any two sides of a triangle, as long as you know the angle between them, you can calculate the length of the third side.   T5 Angular measurement and the unit circle Angles are frequently measured in degrees. However, it is sometimes useful to define angles in terms of the length around the unit circle (a circle of radius = 1). This module introduces radians as a measure of angle.   T6 Circular functions How do I make sense of trigonometric values for angles larger than 90 degrees? This page introduces you to the unit circle and how you can map these angles onto the unit circle to clearly understand their value and (+\/-) sign. See FG6 Circular functions   T7 Trigonometric equations If you know the value of a trigonometric function, how do I find all the possible angles that satisfy this expression? The calculator may only give you one answer to an inverse trig question between 0 and 90 degrees (say InvCos = 40\u00b0). The unit circle can help you visualise the many different solutions for finding your angle \u03b1.   T8 Graphs of sine and cosine functions Sine, cosine and tan functions can be graphed on x-y axes. Read this pdf to see how the amplitude (height) and period or frequency of these functions can be changed. See how the graph can be translated (shifted) along the horizontal or vertical axes.

It is the key mathematical tool for finding the centre of mass or the surface area of a body. Integration is also called antidifferentiation. It is the reverse process of differentiation. If you differentiate an expression, you can integrate it to get back to the original. Geometrically, differentiation provides the slope of graph, whereas integration yields the area below.  These integration worksheets will help you to improve your skills in these areas.   IN1 Antidifferentiation How do you antidifferentiate a function? Antidifferentiation (also called integration) is the opposite operation to differentiation. If you have the differentiation of a function, you can then obtain the original function via integration (antidifferentiation).   IN2 Integration of polynomials How do you integrate a polynomial where x is raised to a power? We saw this in the previous section on antidifferentiation. But how do you integrate a linear expression in brackets where the whole bracket is raised to a power? This worksheet will show you how.   IN3.1 Integration of functions of the form m over (ax+b) How do you integrate a logarithm? How do you integrate an exponential function? How do you integrate a trigonometric function?   IN3.3 Integration of exponential functions    IN3.4 Integration of trigonometric functions    IN4 Definite integrals Integrating means find the area below a graph. How can you limit this to a certain region? Using definite integrals allows you to find the area below, for a defined section along the horizontal x axis. Read this worksheet to see how.   IN5 Area under a curve An area under a curve might be above the axis (and therefore positive). But sections might also be below the axis (and therefore negative). Read this worksheet to see how to deal with finding the integral for sections of graph which go above and below the x-axis (horizontal axis).   IN6 Integration by substitution An expression that is composed of two functions (say an algebraic expression nested within a trigonometric expression) can be complicated to integrate. You can simplify this by substituting a single pronumeral (say u) to represent one of the functions. The substitution rule for integration is like the chain rule for differentiation: it breaks a complex expression into manageable parts.   IN7 Integration using partial fractions How do you integrate an expression when there is an algebraic expression in the numerator and denominator of a fraction? Integrating using partial fractions helps you to solve this problem. Read this worksheet for several worked examples.   IN8 Integration by parts If you can consider your expression to be a product (i.e. Multiplication x) of two functions, you can integrate this using Integration by parts. This reflects the product rule in differentiation and is applicable to logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and algebraic functions.   IN9 Double integrals Integrating will find the area between the curve and the x-axis (horizontal axis). We learned in IN4 Definite integrals how to limit this to a section of the x axis. But what if you have an area that is bounded by limits on both the x and the y axes? You will need to integrate with respect to the x axis and then integrate with respect to the y axis as well.  Double Integrals is the method you will need. Read this worksheet for some examples and exercises. There are linear, exponential and trigonometric functions defining boundaries for shapes on the x-y axes.   ","excerpt":"nodeID: 75 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Integration is vital in engineering.

How to write a summary To create a good summary of a text, you should identify:   its main ideas and intentions  the meaning   relevant details the tone with which the ideas are expressed.   Use the following steps to write a summary.  Step 1 Use the structure of the text to locate the topic and main idea. Identify the purpose. Select only the relevant information. Write notes in point form.   Step 2 Write the summary directly from your notes with a different structure from the source. Use complete sentences. &nbsp;   Step 3 Refer to the original text to ensure your summary reflects its main ideas.   Example Time management is a critical skill for students to develop. Weekly and semester timetables are an excellent way to plan a study program. Students can use them to manage their most important study, work and social commitments and to set themselves study goals. Blocks of time can then be set aside for study, reading, researching and writing. The most urgent tasks can be addressed, whilst work continues on preparing for lectures, tutorials and assignments. If time has been allocated for specific purposes, it is easier to avoid unexpected demands like phone calls, visitors and invitations. Assignments can be completed and submitted on time and to a satisfactory standard.

Step 1: Brainstorm A brainstorm is a thinking process commonly used in study and work situations. It can be done individually or in a group. How to brainstorm  Use a piece of paper to write down everything you can think of about a particular topic. Write the name of the topic in the centre of the page. Do not try to organise the information at all - the purpose is to get it out and onto the page. Use key words or phrases to write your ideas. Always use the paper horizontally as this way you can fit more information.   Example 1 - Brainstorm of the topic 'History of antibiotics'  Step 2: Organise the information Organise the information in the brainstorm by identifying the main categories and linking the other information to those as follows:  circle the main categories connect sub-points to main categories use colours and visuals where helpful.  Example  Step 3: Complete the mind map Rewrite the information under headings and sub-points to make the mind map easy to read.

The study highlights the concerns of teaching staff with regard to mobile phone usage. The fact that the majority of staff view the student use of mobile phones in tutorials as disruptive suggests appropriate guidelines and policies need to be developed.

Always check your Course Guide. Language of recommendations Tentative language is useful for making recommendations. Use words such as 'should', 'could', 'may'. Recommendations often start with 'It is recommended that...' Sample recommendations It is recommended that the university develops official guidelines regarding the use of mobile phones in tutorials. The guidelines should recommend:   Teaching staff have the right to restrict mobile phone usage according to their discretion. Mobile phones may only be used by students in exceptional circumstances.  Finally, the guidelines need to be university wide and clearly communicated to all staff and students.","excerpt":"nodeID: 38 Summary\/excerpt\/SEO: Conclusion and recommendations.

Preparation: What to say Delivery: How to say it   Research The first important step in preparing what to say is to do your research. This involves researching three key areas:  Research your topic. If you are unsure of your content you will not be able to speak confidently. Make sure your topic is specific enough to have a clear focus so you can identify the key ideas and concepts. It should also be broad enough to be interesting and engaging. Research your audience. Your presentation should engage everyone not just your lecturer\/teacher. Does my audience need more background information on my topic? What are the expectations of my&nbsp;talk? Research the venue. Make sure you check where you will be standing, the seating arrangements and any equipment that you will be using such as data projectors, etc.   Plan and organise After you have researched it is important to carefully plan and organise your information. Use the following steps to develop a clear plan for your talk: Step 1: Brainstorm your topic Brainstorm the topic to clarify what you know. Step 2: Organise your information Organise the material logically, e.g. chronologically, spatially (diagrams and maps), sequentially (first,&nbsp;second). Step 3: Develop a plan For more detailed information go to the mind mapping tutorial.  Write and edit Write your talk in full or write detailed notes.  Content Make sure the ideas are logical and clear. Use examples and facts to illustrate your points.   Language Use language appropriate to the audience and purpose, generally a formal but conversational tone is best (no slang or colloquial language).   Structure Summarise your talk into meaningful chunks (e.g. numbered or bullet points). Consisting of main points and supporting details (similiar to an essay plan). Use these brief notes to guide you through your talk.   Practise your presentation  Rehearse your talk at least five times and time yourself. When you know your talk well you will deliver it well. Practise with a friend or family member and get feedback from them. Try practising in front of the mirror. Practise delivering your talk using the main points and brief notes only on cue cards. It is important that you know your topic thoroughly so that you can deliver your presentation confidently.
