      <description>Steven Rendall&#xA;Recent Developments I, 2018&#xA;This is one of 3 works titled Recent Developments: In making these works I was trying to mesh personal conditions and interests to requirements of contemporary painting. This obviously set up a vast array of problems, discrepancies and diversions. The way through this was to hold on to the idea that these paintings could be images of demons. In many cultures a demon is a hybridised creature made up from the components of other creatures – a kind of horrifically meshed collage.</description>

      <description>Home /Assignments /Getting started with assignments /Researching your assignment Integrating ideas with reporting words Whether you are paraphrasing or quoting, integrating the ideas of others with your own argument is an important part of clear, cohesive communication. It’s easy to become repetitive, using ‘this author said’ and ‘that author said’ over and over. Reporting words tell your audience more about a person’s position on a topic, not just that they ‘said’ something.</description>

      <description>Home Referencing Topic sentences A well-written paragraph contains a topic sentence. A topic sentence controls the main idea discussed in a paragraph. It provides the reader with a summary of the key idea and the point of view the writer is expressing. It is often the first sentence as it acts as an introduction to what follows, making it easier for the reader to follow.&#xA;Transcript‘he loves me he loves me not’ is written 21,319 times which represents the number of days I have lived and asked this question.</description>

      <description>Home Referencing Quoting When you are researching a topic, sometimes you want to include the exact words of another author or speaker in your own work. Using someone’s words in their original form is called quoting, or including a direct quote.&#xA;When to quote Quoting is the way to include the exact words of others in our own work. You might want to use a quote when the specific words that an author or speaker has used are important, such as when someone offers a new definition for a term or presents a new theory.</description>

      <description>Keith W Clancy&#xA;BLACK WHOLE (RMX), 2019&#xA;RMIT University Gallery&#xA;BLACK WHOLE (RMX) restages an imaginary cabaret performed by an unidentified Officer: he is at once a ghost, a dream and a traumatic symptom.&#xA;Richard Strauss’s opera Ariadne auf Naxos (1916) acts as a self-nesting framework for this meta-fictional allegory about art, sex, death and childhood. Against the silent commentary of old master paintings, arias by Handel and Vivaldi are ‘mistranslated’ by texts adapted from Octave Mirbeau’s ‘The Torture Garden’ (1899).</description>
