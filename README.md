# wordpress-hugo-learning-lab

**wordpress-hugo-learning-lab** is a static website built using the Hugo framework. It aims to replicate the PicoStrap 5 WordPress theme used by the Learning Lab in a static environment, facilitating rapid UI development. As the Learning Lab evolves, this site will become less critical and may fall out of sync with updates in the design system and the Learning Lab WordPress site.
